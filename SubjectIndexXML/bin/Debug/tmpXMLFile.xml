    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was charged for an offence of trafficking 2,600.7 grams of heroin under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act")</LINK>. The appellant was about to board a flight to Paris at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport with four plastic packets containing the said drugs found strapped to his legs during the material time of his arrest. At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the trial judge held that the prosecution succeeded in proving a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking against the appellant. The trial judge further held that the prosecution had proved <i>mens rea</i> possession of the proscribed drugs and trafficking as defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> by the appellant. He was accordingly sentenced to death. The appellant filed an appeal to this court against the decision on the following main grounds; (a) the appellant was an innocent carrier; (b) the Government chemist, PW2, did not comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(j) of the Act</LINK>; (c) the drug exhibits produced and tendered in court were not the drug exhibits recovered from the appellant; and (d) that the time stated in the charge was incorrect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The manner in which the four plastic packets were strapped to the appellant's thigh calves and concealed underneath the pants indicated an intention on the appellant's part to avoid detection and thereby pointed to his knowledge of the drugs. That gave rise to an inescapable inference that the appellant must have known that the four plastic packets contained the dangerous drugs and therefore, was not an innocent carrier. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was no issue of non-compliance of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(j) of the Act</LINK> in the present case. From the PW2's evidence, it was clear that she had analysed almost all of the white substances handed to her, thereby making it unnecessary for the prosecution to rely on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(j) of the Act</LINK>. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The evidence showed that the same drug exhibits which were recovered from the appellant were sent to the chemist for analysis and later tendered in court. There was no basis to the defence's allegation that the drug exhibits had been tampered. Furthermore, there was no merit in the defence's contention with regard to the time of the offence.

    <p>
      <b>Hasan Lah JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged for an offence of trafficking 2,600.7 grams of heroin under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act")</LINK> and the charge reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the conclusion of the trial the learned High Court Judge ("the trial judge") convicted the appellant for the offence as charged and he was accordingly sentenced to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant filed an appeal to this court against the decision. The appellant's appeal was dismissed. We now give the grounds for our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Case for the Prosecution</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The case against the appellant as found by the trial judge is as follows. On 27 September 2003 at about 10.30 pm Kunasegaran a/l Kandasamy (PW4) was on duty at B2 Departing Gate of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport ("KLIA") to check the passengers boarding flight MH20 to Paris. While he was checking on the passengers PW4 observed the appellant walking in a limping manner ("berjalan berjongket-jongket dengan keadaan tidak sempurna") when passing through the metal walk through detector. PW4 was shown a boarding pass by the appellant and from the boarding pass it was confirmed by PW4 that the appellant was one of the passengers to board the said flight to Paris.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> For security purposes PW4 conducted a body search on the appellant. PW4 found something bulky stuck to the appellant's right calf. Immediately PW4 contacted the narcotics officers from the Narcotics Department of KLIA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> About 10 minutes later Detective Sergeant Alias bin Karim (PW5) and Detective Corporal Kamaruzzaman bin Awang came to Gate B2. PW4 and PW5 brought the appellant to a room next to Gate B2 for a body search. Inside the room PW4 asked the appellant to take off his pants. PW4 observed that there were 4 packets strapped to the appellant's legs. One packet was strapped with a knee guard to each side of the appellant's thigh and one packet was strapped with a transparent plastic to each side of the appellant's calves.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> From there the appellant was brought to the office of the Narcotics Department at KLIA which was located at the third floor for a thorough body search by PW4 and PW5. Inside a room at the Narcotics Department's office PW4 found that the four packets wrapped to the appellant's legs contained white powdery substance covered by black powdery substance. According to PW4 the appellant appeared to be scared and worried during the body search.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> After marking the items recovered from the appellant PW4 handed them over to the investigating officer, acting ASP Lee Chee Yong (PW7) at about 3.30 am, together with the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> PW7 sent the 4 plastic packets containing the black and white substances to the Government Chemist, Halimah binti Abdul Rahim (PW2). The contents of each of the 4 plastic packets were analysed by PW2 and they were found to contain a total of 2600.7 grams of heroin.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The plastic wrappers (L1-L4), the knee guards (L5-L6) and the appellant's saliva specimens (L7) were sent for DNA analysis. DNA profiles were successfully obtained from the above samples, except the swab taken from plastic wrapper L4 and knee guards L5 and L6. On comparison with the appellant's DNA the results are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Case For The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In his defence the appellant did not dispute that the 4 plastic packets were strapped around his legs and he was on his way to board the flight to Paris. He, however, denied that he knew that the 4 packets contained dangerous drugs. He believed the 4 plastic packets to contain Chinese medicine.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> According to the appellant, on the day in question before he went to KLIA he stayed at Hotel Park Inn at Sg Wang Plaza. Between 7.00 to 8.00 pm two persons came to his room. He did not know them. These two persons brought with them a bag. They asked him to take off his pants. They wrapped 4 packets around his legs. When he asked them why must the 4 packets be wrapped around his legs he was told that the packets contained Chinese medicine and it was illegal to bring Chinese medicine to Holland. They did not open the packets for him to see their contents. He was also given an air ticket, money and a phone card. They told him that his flight to Paris was at 11.00 pm. He then took a taxi to KLIA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings of the Trial Judge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution the trial judge held that the prosecution succeeded in proving a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking against the appellant. The trial judge held that the prosecution had proved <i>mens rea </i>possession of the proscribed drugs and trafficking as defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> by the appellant. With regard to trafficking the trial judge opined that the manner the proscribed drugs were concealed and the fact that the appellant was carrying them would point irresistibly to the fact that the appellant was trafficking in the proscribed drugs. The trial judge did not invoke the presumptions of possession and trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. The pertinent part of the judgment of the trial judge can be found at pp 613 to 614 of the Appeal Record:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Alternatively, the trial judge held that the prosecution had proved possession of the proscribed drugs by the appellant by invoking the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> and further found that there was direct evidence of trafficking against the appellant. In this connection the trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> With regard to the appellant's defence, the trial judge when rejecting the appellant's defence, took into consideration the appellant's evidence that if he were caught in Holland for carrying the Chinese medicine the item would only be seized by the authority there but there would be no action taken against him. Under cross-examination the appellant agreed that the 4 packets could be kept in his bag. The appellant also said he would be paid RM20,000.00 after he delivered them eventually. The trial judge found it rather odd for the appellant to take instruction from the two persons whom he did not know. The trial judge also took into consideration the appellant's evidence that he would be staying in Paris for three or four days. In Paris he would receive further instruction to whom to deliver the 4 packets. The trial judge was of the view that the appellant's story could not reasonably be true.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Having carefully considered the defence, together with the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as a whole, the trial judge found that the appellant had failed to raise a doubt in the prosecution's case that he knew that the 4 plastic packets contained heroin. The trial judge further held that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and the appellant was convicted accordingly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> There were altogether 18 grounds of appeal stated in the appellant's petition of appeal. However in his submission, learned counsel for the appellant raised the following issues:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Innocent Carrier And The Appellant's Knowledge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that on the facts of this case the appellant was an innocent carrier as he believed the contents of the 4 plastic packets were Chinese medicine. The evidence showed that the white substance (the heroin) was covered with the black substance, (the coffee) and they were wrapped with the plastic. When he was stopped by PW4 he did not try to run away or become aggressive.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that as the appellant did not know the contents of the 4 plastic packets the prosecution had to rely on the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to prove possession against the appellant. According to learned counsel, there was no evidence of trafficking as defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>. At most, he argued, the appellant should be convicted of possession of the proscribed drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We had carefully considered the judgment of the trial judge and the reasons given by her in her finding that the appellant knew the contents of the 4 plastic packets were heroin. We had no reason to disagree with her. In our view, the trial judge did not err in her decision on this issue. It is trite law that the appellate court ought to be slow in disturbing the finding of fact as the trial judge has had the benefit of observing the demeanour of the witnesses testifying before her (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_784;"><i>Lee Ah Seng &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 784</LINK>; [2007] 5 CLJ 1)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Proof of knowledge is very often a matter of inference. It would be sufficient for the prosecution to prove facts from which it could properly be inferred that the accused had the necessary knowledge (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Parlen bin Dadeh</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2009] 1 CLJ 717). In the instant case the manner the 4 plastic packets were strapped to the appellant's thighs and calves and concealed underneath the pants would indicate an intention to avoid detection and thereby pointed to his knowledge. They would give rise to an inescapable inference that the appellant must have known that the 4 plastic packets contained the dangerous drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Having evaluated the appellant's defence the trial judge found that the defence was a bare denial. It is trite law that a mere denial without any other proof to reasonably dislodge the prosecution's evidence is not sufficient (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_416;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Ling Tee Huah</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 416</LINK>; [1982] 2 MLJ 324). On the evidence we were unable to agree with the defence's contention that the appellant was an innocent carrier. The evidence did not support the defence of innocent carrier. The appellant had explained that the 4 plastic packets were concealed underneath his pants because it was illegal to bring them, of which he believed to be Chinese medicine, to Holland. The appellant testified that he was asked to carry the 4 plastic packets by 2 unknown persons to Holland and in return would be paid RM20,000.00. Under cross-examination he said that was the first time he met the two unknown persons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> If the 4 plastic packets contained only Chinese medicine there was no reason for the appellant to be paid RM20,000.00 for delivering them to Holland and there was no reason to conceal them underneath his pants right away from KLIA. He could have put the 4 plastic packets in his bag first because he was going to Paris first. The only reason why he did not keep the 4 plastic packets in his bag was that he knew that they contained dangerous drugs. If they were kept in his bag it was likely that the drugs would be detected at KLIA. On the evidence, and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the appellant could not be said to be an innocent carrier. Right from the beginning he was aware that the 4 plastic packets contained dangerous drugs. His defence, when tested against the totality of the evidence adduced, was difficult to be believed. More importantly, it failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Section 37(j) of the Act</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the Government chemist (PW2) did not comply with the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(j) of the Act</LINK> because in SP2's evidence she said she had analysed all the receptacles. However according to the investigating officer (PW7) there were some white substance left in Ex P47 (Ex P47 was one of the plastic packets recovered from the appellant). Learned counsel submitted that there was no clear evidence as to how much of the drug exhibits were analysed by PW2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> This issue had been considered by the trial judge and in her judgment she said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The trial judge opined that the failure of the chemist to take all the white substance in the 4 plastic packets did not in any way prejudice the appellant. We agreed with the trial judge. Further, in our view there was no issue of non-compliance of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(j) of the Act</LINK> in the present case. From SP2's evidence it was clear that she had analysed almost all of the white substances handed to her and thereby making it unnecessary for the prosecution to rely on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(j) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In this connection the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_317;"><i>Chu Tak Fai v. Public Prosecutor</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 317</LINK>; [2007] 1 MLJ 201 at p 215 ; [2006] 4 CLJ 931 opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Break In The Chain Of Evidence And Handling Of The Drug Exhibits</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the drug exhibits produced and tendered in court were not the drug exhibits recovered from the appellant. He contended that the drug exhibits had been tampered with when they were left at the office of the Narcotics Department at the third floor of KLIA building. He argued that when PW4 escorted the appellant to the toilet, PW5 and Corporal Kamaruzzaman were not there to look after the drug exhibits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In support of that contention learned counsel for the appellant referred to the evidence of PW3, the Government Forensic Chemist, who had carried out DNA analysis on the samples from the plastic wrapper marked L1 where it was revealed that it was a mixed profile consistent with having been contributed by at least two male sources and the appellant was being excluded as being one of the contributors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The issue whether the drug exhibits had been tampered with at the office of the Narcotics Department in KLIA had been carefully considered by the trial judge. In her judgment the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On the evidence available we had no reason to disagree with the finding of the trial judge on this issue. We were satisfied that the same drug exhibits which were recovered from the appellant were sent to the chemist for analysis and later tendered in court. There was no basis to the defence's allegation that the drug exhibits had been tampered with or there was a break in the chain of evidence and handling of the drug exhibits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> PW4 confirmed and identified all the 4 plastic packets which contained the proscribed drugs seized from the appellant. The same exhibits were handed over to the investigating officer, PW7, at about 3.30 am on 28 September 2003, which was about four hours after the drug exhibits were recovered from the appellant. PW7 handed over the drug exhibits to the Forensic Department for fingerprint analysis, then to PW3 for DNA analysis and finally to PW2 for drugs analysis. PW7 later received the drug exhibits back from PW2 and then sent them to PW1, the storekeeper, for safe keeping. PW2, PW4 and PW7 identified the exhibits relating to the drugs in court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Time Of The Charge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the time stated in the charge was not correct because in PW4's evidence PW4 said the appellant's body was searched in the room next to Gate B2 at about 10.50 pm The charge alleged the offence to take place at about 11.30 pm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> This issue had also been considered by the trial judge. In her judgment she said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We agreed with the finding of the trial judge on this issue and as such we found no merit in the defence's contention with regard to the time of the offence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We had carefully considered the defence put up by the appellant and we were satisfied that the defence failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case with regard to <i>mens rea</i> possession and the element of trafficking in the proscribed drugs. We came to the conclusion that the trial judge was right in convicting the appellant for the offence of trafficking in the proscribed drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> For the above reasons we found the appellant's appeal was devoid of any merit. The conviction and sentence imposed by the trial judge were therefore affirmed.</p>
