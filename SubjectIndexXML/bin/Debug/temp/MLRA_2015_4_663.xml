    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The 1st defendant, CPA Australia ("CPAA"), was an accounting body incorporated in Australia with worldwide membership. Membership of CPAA was subject to the Constitution and By-Laws of CPAA. According to arts 72 to 81 of the CPAA Constitution, CPAA was controlled and managed by a Board of Directors ("the Board"). On 18 February 2002, the Board established the Malaysian Division of CPAA pursuant to art 35 of the CPAA Constitution. On 7 May 2002, CPAA was registered as a foreign company in Malaysia. The plaintiff was admitted as a member of CPAA on 12 May 1993, and elected as a Divisional Councillor of the Malaysian Divisional Council of CPAA for the term 2003/2004. As a result of several complaints received by CPAA in December 2003, CPAA notified the plaintiff and other Divisional Councillors that the Malaysian Divisional Council was suspended temporarily for six months, pending the holding of an enquiry into the complaints. Subsequent to the investigations, the Board initiated disciplinary proceedings against the then President of the Malaysian Division and three Divisional Councillors including the plaintiff. On 20 April 2004, the plaintiff received a Notice of Meeting with a detailed case-book showing that he had a case to answer with respect to the alleged misconduct. A Disciplinary Committee ("DC") hearing was fixed on 27 July 2004, which date the plaintiff was informed of. However, on 23 July 2004 the plaintiff wrote informing CPAA that he would not be attending the hearing. The DC nevertheless proceeded with the hearing on 27 July 2004. The charges against the plaintiff were considered and the plaintiff's letter of 23 July 2004 was taken and considered as the plaintiff's submission. On 27 July 2004, the DC found the plaintiff guilty of three of the five charges laid against the plaintiff. The DC also decided to: (i) forfeit the plaintiff's membership with a ban on re-applying for admission for 10 years; (ii) publish the DC's decision; and (iii) impose costs of RM20,000.00. The plaintiff appealed against the decision by an undated letter which was received by CPAA out of time. CPAA rejected the plaintiff's appeal. The plaintiff sued in the High Court to inter alia, nullify the findings of the DC and CPAA. The High Court allowed the plaintiff's action and CPAA appealed to the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff also preferred an appeal against the award of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing CPAA's appeal with costs; dismissing the plaintiff's appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The suspension of the Malaysian Divisional Council and its Divisional Councillors took effect on 9 December 2003. Notwithstanding whether the plaintiff's claim was founded on contract or tort, time ran from the date of the breach; and in the instant case the six year period would have expired on 8 December 2009. Since the claim was filed on 13 July 2010, the claim insofar as it concerned the suspension of the Malaysian Divisional Council and its Divisional Councillors, was clearly time-barred. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Articles 26, 27(1), 35 and 92 of the CPAA Constitution read together empowered the Board to suspend the Malaysian Divisional Council and regulate the conduct of its members, including disciplinary matters concerning a member. Thus, the Board resolution passed on 9 December 2003 confirming the suspension of the Malaysian Divisional Council including the plaintiff's role as a Divisional Councillor for the purposes of conducting an investigation into the complaints, was valid and proper. (paras 26 &amp; 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The registration of CPAA as a foreign company in Malaysia was intended to register CPAA's presence in Malaysia for the purpose of carrying on business within Malaysia. The fact of registration of CPAA did not in itself create a new legal entity under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">Companies Act 1965</LINK>. The registration of CPAA as a foreign company in Malaysia on 7 May 2002 was to enable the transfer of the publishing licence of the Member's Newsletter "Berita CPA" to the registered foreign company. CPAA and the foreign company were not distinct and separate entities. The finding of the High Court that there was a distinction between the Australian Body and the Malaysian Body and that the plaintiff whilst being a member of the Australian Body was also a member of the Malaysian Body, was a misdirection in fact and in law. (paras 28, 30, 31 &amp; 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The Malaysian Division was part of the structure of CPAA and was subject to the direction of the Board. The CPAA Constitution and By-Laws governed all members of CPAA, including those attached to the Malaysian Division. Therefore, the plaintiff's argument that the Malaysian Division of CPAA was a different entity from CPAA was fallacious. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The plaintiff's argument that the CPAA had no power to suspend the Malaysian Divisional Council and the plaintiff as a Divisional Councillor was without merit. The power of the Board to suspend the Malaysia Divisional Council and its Divisional Councillors was provided under art 92 of the CPAA Constitution. Further, the plaintiff's complaint that he was not given an opportunity to answer any concerns CPAA might have, was misplaced as the suspension was to facilitate investigations; and the plaintiff was in fact given ample opportunity to answer. At any rate, there was no provision in the CPAA Constitution and By-Laws that an opportunity be afforded before the Board exercised its power of suspension. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Since the Malaysian Divisional Council was part of the internal structure of CPAA and was not a different incorporated entity, the question of convening an EGM did not arise. Further, since the plaintiff was neither a member nor a Director of the foreign company, he was in no position to call for an EGM. (para 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The High Court also alluded to the fact that the investigations were improper as the investigation powers were vested with the Divisional Director and since the Divisional Director was also suspended, it was not possible for the Divisional Director to carry out any investigations. This court could not agree with the High Court on this point. A reading of By-Law 303 showed that the power to deal with a complaint was not vested solely with a Divisional Director. Clearly, the Board of other duly authorised officers, in this case DW2, might lay any charge or raise any matter relating to any member that might need investigation. (paras 37 &amp; 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> This court would disagree with the findings of the High Court on the issue of penalties imposed on the plaintiff. In the same breath, the plaintiff's claim for damages for defamation was clearly unsustainable. (para 42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The High Court had not adverted to earlier High Court decisions made in two cases arising from the same facts, concerning the same allegations of misconduct and from the same set of disciplinary proceedings. In those two cases, the High Court judges dismissed the claims on the grounds that: (i) the proceedings were private proceedings involving the membership of CPAA; (ii) the plaintiffs were bound by the CPAA Constitution and By-Laws; and (iii) there was no miscarriage of justice in the disciplinary proceedings. In the instant case, if the High Court had given sufficient consideration to those two other High Court decisions, it might have arrived at a different conclusion. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> As a general rule, an appellate court would not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial court unless it could be shown that there were exceptional circumstances. In the instant case, the High Court judge had failed to judicially appreciate the evidence and had acted on some irrelevant evidence as to render his decision so unreasonable that the order of the High Court ought to be set aside in the interests of justice.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> There were two appeals before us. Both appeals are in respect of the High Court decision dated 28 June 2013 allowing the plaintiff's claim for relief to nullify the findings, suspension and forfeiture of the plaintiff's membership with the 1st defendant as a result of disciplinary proceedings undertaken by the 1st defendant against the plaintiff and for damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Appeal No: 1559 is the 1st defendant's appeal against part of the decision of the High Court relating to the issue of the 1st defendant's liability and the award of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Appeal No: 1733 is the plaintiff's appeal against part of the decision on the quantum of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> After hearing of submissions of counsel of the parties we allowed Appeal No: 1559 with costs of RM20,000.00 and dismissed Appeal No: 1733 with costs of RM10,000.00. The grounds of the decision are as follows. For convenience, the parties shall be referred to as they were in the High Court suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Account Of The Salient Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The 1st defendant CPA Australia ('CPAA') is an accounting body incorporated in Australia as a public company limited by guarantee. It has worldwide membership with more than 150,000 finance, accounting and business professionals in 121 countries. Membership of CPAA is voluntary and is subject to the Constitution and By-Laws of CPAA. According to arts 72 to 81 of the CPAA Constitution, CPAA is controlled and managed by its Board of Directors ("the Board"). On 7 May 2002, CPAA was registered as a foreign company in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 18 February 2002, the Board established the Malaysian Division of CPAA pursuant to art 35 of the CPAA Constitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The plaintiff was admitted as a member of CPAA on 12 May 1993. The plaintiff was elected as a Divisional Councillor of the Malaysian Divisional Council of CPAA for the term 2003/2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> As a result of several complaints received by CPAA relating to the President and some of the Divisional Councillors of the Malaysian Division, in December 2003 CPAA notified the plaintiff and other Divisional Councillors that the Malaysian Divisional Council was suspended temporarily for six months, pending the holding of an enquiry into the complaints.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Subsequent to investigations carried out, the Board decided to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the then President of the Malaysia Division and three Divisional Councillors including the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The plaintiff received a Notice of Meeting together with a detailed case book dated 20 April 2004 that he had a case to answer with respect to the alleged misconduct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Meanwhile, a Disciplinary Committee ("DC") which was scheduled in Kuala Lumpur on 28 May 2004 was postponed to 26 July 2004 and 27 July 2004 to consider the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The plaintiff was notified of the rescheduled hearing of the DC vide CPAA's letter dated 24 June 2004. On 23 July 2004, the plaintiff wrote to CPAA stating, inter alia that he will not be attending the scheduled hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 26 July 2004, the DC proceeded with the hearing. The plaintiff was not present at the hearing. The Chairman of the DC entered a plea of not guilty on the plaintiff's behalf. The DC proceeded to consider the charges on its merits; the plaintiff's letter of 23 July 2004 was taken as the plaintiff's submission and considered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 27 July 2004, the DC unanimously found the plaintiff guilty on three out of five charges laid while two other charges were not proceeded with. Consequently, the DC decided to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The plaintiff was given formal notification of the DC's decision and of his right and deadline to file an appeal against the said decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The plaintiff lodged his appeal under an undated letter which was received by CPAA out of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> By CPAA's letter dated 21 September 2004, the plaintiff was informed that his appeal had been rejected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> At the outset, it is pertinent to note the learned JC's finding that the suspension of the Malaysian Divisional Council and the Divisional Councillors is wrong is premised on the following factors:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As a consequence of the aforesaid findings, the learned JC further found that the penalties imposed by the disciplinary committee violated the plaintiff's contractual rights under the CPAA's Constitution, Articles of Association and By-Laws. This led to the Appeal No: 1559.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The learned JC also held that the publication on CPAA's worldwide web of the charges, the decisions of the disciplinary committee of CPAA and the consequent penalty imposed on the plaintiff defamed the plaintiff's reputation professionally and personally. CPAA's defence of qualified privilege was rejected on the ground that CPAA had acted maliciously and in blatant disregard of the plaintiff's rights. This forms the subject of Appeal No: 1733.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On the issue of limitation, the learned JC took the view that the cause of action began on 4 August 2004, when CPAA's formal written notification of the findings and decision of the disciplinary committee was provided to the plaintiff or on 29 September 2004 when CPAA published the decisions of the disciplinary committee. As such, the plaintiff's claim which was filed on 13 July 2010 was not time-barred. The plaintiff was awarded nominal damages of RM50,000.00, no award for aggravated and exemplary damages was made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Having considered the oral and written submissions of the parties and having perused the record of appeal and the common core bundles filed herein, we proposed to deal with the issue of limitation first.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Limitation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is CPAA's pleaded case that the claim is time-barred as the claim was brought after the expiry of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6 Limitation Act 1953</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On this issue, the facts are uncontroverted. It is clear that the suspension of the Malaysian Divisional Council and its Divisional Councillors took effect on 9 December 2003. Notwithstanding whether the plaintiff's claim is founded on contract or tort, time runs from the date of the breach; and in this case the sixyear period would have expired on 8 December 2009. Since the claim was filed on 13 July 2010, the claim insofar as it relates to the suspension of the Malaysian Divisional Council and its Divisional Councillors is clearly time-barred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Validity Of The Disciplinary Proceedings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Pursuant to art 3(2) of the CPAA Constitution, the plaintiff who is a member of CPAA shall be bound by the CPAA Constitution, the Articles of Association and the By-Laws. According to arts 26 and 27(1) of the CPAA Constitution, the Board is empowered to regulate the conduct of its members and impose penalties on any person found guilty of a breach of the CPAA Constitution or By-Laws. It is also stipulated under art 35 of the CPAA Constitution that a division is subject directions given from time to time by the Board. More significantly, art 92 provides that a Divisional Council's powers, duties and discretions are subject always to the control of the Board.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We agree with learned counsel for CPAA that, arts 26, 27(1), 35 and 92 of the CPAA Constitution read together empower the Board to suspend the Malaysian Divisional Council and regulate the conduct of its members including on disciplinary matters regarding a member.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As such, the Board resolution passed on 9 December 2003 confirming the suspension of the Malaysian Divisional Council including the plaintiff's role as a Divisional Councillor for the purposes of conducting an investigation into the complaints is valid and proper.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether CPAA ("The Australian Body") And CPAA Registered As A Foreign Company In Malaysia ("The Malaysian Body") Are Separate Entities?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> A foreign company is defined as a company, corporation, society, association, or other body incorporated outside Malaysia (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;4.;;">s 4(1) of the Companies Act 1965 (CA 1965)</LINK>). A foreign company which has a place of business or carrying on business within Malaysia must be registered under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">CA 1965</LINK>. The term "carrying on business" is general in nature and encompasses establishing or using a share transfer or share registration office or administering, managing or otherwise dealing with properties in Malaysia as an agent, legal personal representative or trustee, whether by servants or agents or otherwise (<LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;330.;;">s 330(1) of CA 1965</LINK>). The registration of CPAA as a foreign company in Malaysia is intended to register CPAA's presence in Malaysia for the purpose of carrying on business within Malaysia. The fact of registration of CPAA did not in itself create a new legal entity under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">CA 1965</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In contrast, the formation or incorporation of a new company is preceded by the reservation of the proposed name of the intended company by its incorporators. Thereafter, the incorporators must lodge with the Registrar of Companies certain documents including the memorandum and articles of association, documents required to be filed by the promoters, the first directors and company secretary and statutory declarations. Once the Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the papers are in order, the Registrar will issue a certificate of incorporation. Upon the issuance of the certificate of incorporation, the company is recognised by law as being a separate legal person from its members.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Therefore, the fact that CPAA was registered as a foreign company in Malaysia did not in itself create a separate and different entity. The registration of CPAA as a foreign company in Malaysia on 7 May 2002 was to enable the transfer of the publishing licence of Member's Newsletter "Berita CPA" to the registered foreign company. Prior to its incorporation, a society established under the Societies Act 1966 held the publishing licence. As the society was being wound up, the registration of CPAA as a foreign company in Malaysia was necessary to facilitate the transfer of the licence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In the circumstances, the foreign company is in law and in fact the registered local corporate entity of CPAA. As such CPAA and the foreign company are not distinct and separate entities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Accordingly, we are constrained to hold that the finding of the learned JC that there is a distinction between the Australian Body and the Malaysian Body and that the plaintiff whilst being a member of the Australian Body is also a member of the Malaysian Body is a misdirection in fact and in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> As adverted to earlier, the Malaysian Division was established by the Board by way of a Board Resolution dated 1 April 2002 pursuant to art 35 of the CPAA Constitution. Members are attached to a Division by virtue of their geographical residence under art 35 of the CPAA Constitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> As such, the Malaysian Division is a part of the structure of CPAA and is subject to the direction of the Board. All members of CPAA including those attached to the Malaysian Division are governed by the CPAA Constitution and By-Laws. Therefore, the plaintiff's argument that the Malaysian Division of CPAA is a different entity from CPAA is fallacious.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In this light, the plaintiff's argument that the CPAA had no power to suspend the Malaysian Divisional Council and the plaintiff as a Divisional Councillor is without merit. The power of the Board to suspend the Malaysia Divisional Council and its Divisional Councillors is provided under art 92 of the CPAA Constitution. Further, the plaintiff's complaint that he was not given an opportunity to answer any concerns that CPAA may have, is misplaced as the suspension was to facilitate investigations; and the plaintiff was in fact given ample opportunity to answer. At any rate, there is no provision in the CPAA Constitution and By-Laws that an opportunity be afforded before the Board exercises its power of suspension.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The learned JC also said that the Board failed to convene an EGM to table a resolution to a vote of no confidence against the Malaysian Divisional Council. With respect we are unable to agree with that view for the simple reason that since the Malaysian Divisional Council is a part of the internal structure of CPAA and is not a different incorporated entity, the question of convening an EGM does not arise. Further, since the plaintiff is neither a member nor a Director of the foreign company, he is in no position to call for an EGM.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The learned JC also alluded to the fact that the investigations were improper as the investigation powers were vested with the Divisional Director. In the present case, the Divisional Director was also suspended. As such, it was not possible for the Divisional Director to carry out any investigations. Learned counsel for CPAA submitted that the learned JC's holding was presumably premised on By-Law 302.4 which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Since the Divisional Director had been suspended, By-Law 302.4 could not be resorted to. It is therefore necessary to consider the import of the operative words "Subject to By-Law 303 below". By-Law 303 states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> A reading of By-Law 303 shows that the power to deal with a complaint is not vested solely with a Divisional Director. Clearly, the Board of other duly authorised officer (in this case DW2) may lay any charge or raise any matter relating to any member that may need investigation. For the foregoing reasons, we do not agree with the learned JC on this point.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The learned JC also held that the penalties imposed on the plaintiff violated the plaintiff's contractual rights under the CPAA Constitution and By-Laws. On the undisputed facts, the plaintiff was given 14 days' notice of the disciplinary hearing but elected to not to attend the same. The requirements for the giving of at least 14 days prior notice pursuant to art 29 had been complied with by CPAA. The plaintiff's written response was nevertheless considered by the disciplinary committee at the hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Pursuant to art 27(1) of the CPAA Constitution, the Board may impose any of the penalties set out in subclause (2). Subclause (2) provides for penalties that may be imposed by the Board and they include among others, the forfeiture of membership, a fine not exceeding the amount set by the Board, and such other penalty as the Board deems appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In the circumstances, we are also constrained to disagree with the findings of the learned JC on the issue of penalties imposed on the plaintiff. In the same breath, the plaintiff's claim for damages for defamation is clearly unsustainable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We also observe in passing that in his Grounds of Decision the learned JC did not advert to the earlier High Court decisions made in the two cases arising from the same facts, concerning the same allegations of misconduct and from the same set of disciplinary proceedings. Learned counsel for CPAA submitted that the prayers of all three cases are virtually the same. Upon a perusal of the relevant cause papers, we find that there is basis in the submission. In both cases, the High Court Judges dismissed the claims on the grounds that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Insofar as Appeal No: 1733 is concerned, the award of damages was made on the basis of the plaintiff's claim for defamation as a result of the CPAA's publication of the charges, the decision of the Disciplinary Committee and the consequent penalty imposed including the forfeiture of his membership and the fine imposed on him on CPAA's worldwide web. The learned JC held that since CPAA had acted maliciously and in blatant disregard of the plaintiff's rights, CPAA has lost their defence of qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Since the issue of liability has been allowed in CPAA's favour, Appeal No: 1733 on the quantum of damages has been rendered academic.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> As a general rule, an appellate court will not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial unless it can be shown that there are exceptional circumstances. In the present case, we are satisfied that the learned JC has failed to judicially appreciate the evidence and had acted on some irrelevant evidence as to render his decision so unreasonable that we are constrained to set aside the order of the High Court in the interest of justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In consequence, Appeal No: 1559 was allowed with costs and Appeal No: 1733 was dismissed with costs as above.</p>
