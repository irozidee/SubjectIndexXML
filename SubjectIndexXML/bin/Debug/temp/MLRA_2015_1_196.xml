    <p>The appellant had agreed to grant housing loan facilities to the borrower for the purchase of two apartment units. The appellant appointed the respondent to act as its solicitors in the loan transaction and documentation. Clause 4 of the sale and purchase agreement provided for the purchaser to pay the purchase price to the vendor. The respondent subsequently wrote to the appellant confirming that all legal documentation was in order and advising the appellant to release through the respondent the loan amount to one Messrs KY Lee &amp; Associates ("KYL") - solicitors acting for the borrower. The appellant paid the loan moneys into KYL's account. The borrower defaulted and it was discovered that the borrower and his solicitors were in fact the same person. The appellant had become a victim of fraud perpetrated by the borrower or his solicitors. The appellant claimed against the respondent for damages for negligence in the discharge of its duty of care as solicitors for the appellant. The respondent in turn claimed for an indemnity against the third party - a partner in the respondent's firm who had handled the documentation and transaction. The High Court found that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondent was negligent. The appellant's claim was therefore dismissed and the respondent's claim for indemnity against the third party was also dismissed. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondent was not negligent in the preparation of the loan documentation. However, the respondent was negligent in advising the appellant to release the loan amount in favour of the borrower's solicitors notwithstanding that cl 4 of the sale and purchase agreement specifically provided that the purchase price was to be paid to the vendor. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Clause 4 of the sale &amp; purchase agreement specifically stated that the loan sum was to be released to the vendor. By advising the appellant to release the loan sum to the borrower's solicitors, the respondent had acted negligently by giving advice that was clearly contrary to the contractual provisions even though it was the respondent's opinion that it was safe to do so since the demand drafts were paid into KYL's clients' account. (para 18)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aziah Ali JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, AmBank (M) Berhad (the plaintiff in the court below) had appointed the respondent, Messrs Abd Gani Che Man &amp; Co (the defendant in the court below), as its solicitors to handle the documentation for a loan transaction. The third party in the court below, Ahmad Arshad bin Yahaya was, at the material time, a partner in the respondent firm who had handled the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant had agreed to grant housing loan facilities to one Sim Ban Ee ("the borrower") for the total sum of RM193,200.00 ("the loan sum") to purchase two apartment units in a project known as 'Seri Indah Apartment' in Penang ("the Properties") from the vendor, Metro Development Sdn Bhd ("the vendor"). The developer of the Properties was Lip Sin Company Sdn Bhd ("the Developer"). The offer was accepted by the borrower (p 376 Appeal Record). This was followed by a letter dated 16 April 2001 from the appellant to the respondent instructing the respondent to act on the appellant's behalf in the security documentation of the loan (p 287 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant's letter dated 16 April 2001 to the respondent reads <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>

    </table>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The loan documentation checklist ("the checklist") can be found at pp 237-238 of the Appeal Record.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondent had sent a letter to the appellant dated 23 May 2001 confirming that all legal documentation was in order and in the same letter had advised the appellant that it was in order for the appellant to release through the respondent the loan amount in favour of Messrs KY Lee &amp; Associates ("KY Lee"), the solicitors acting for the borrower (pp 235-236 Appeal Record). Acting on the said letter, on 28 May 2001 the appellant sent to the respondent demand drafts made in favour of KY Lee (pp 240-241 Appeal Record). As requested by KY Lee, the respondent then deposited the two demand drafts into the client's account of KY Lee (p 300 Appeal Record). This account had been opened by KY Lee at the appellant's Seberang Jaya branch in the year 2000 (p 266 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The borrower defaulted on the loan repayment and letters of demand were sent by the appellant's solicitors to the borrower. Unfortunately the appellant was not able to foreclose on the Properties. Investigations by the appellant revealed that the borrower, Sim Ban Ee and the borrower's purported solicitor, Lee Kon Yew, was one and the same person (pp 247 and 506 Appeal Record). The appellant further discovered that the said Lee Kon Yew was not a registered member of the Malaysian Bar (p 244 Appeal Record). Investigations also revealed that the National Registration Department has no record of the identity card number of Sim Ban Ee. Hence, the evidence showed that the appellant had been a victim of fraud perpetrated by Sim Ban Ee/Lee Kon Yew.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant's claim against the respondent was for damages for negligence in the discharge of its duty of care as solicitors for the appellant. The respondent in turn filed a claim for indemnity against the third party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> By paras 16 and 17 of the statement of claim, the appellant alleged the following particulars of negligence against the respondent which we reproduce as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Premised on the alleged negligence, vide para 19 of the statement of claim the appellant prayed for the following reliefs:</p>

      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned JC accepted the testimony of SD3, the third party, that he had verified that the Properties were free from encumbrances and had also verified that the borrower was not a bankrupt at the material time. The learned JC found that the respondent had prepared all the loan documentation in accordance with all the requirements found in the Check List provided by the appellant to the respondent. It was the finding of the learned JC that the appellant's instructions to the respondent did not include the verification of the authenticity of the documents. The learned JC found that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondent was negligent. The appellant's claim was therefore dismissed and the respondent's claim for indemnity against the third party was also accordingly dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court, hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The issues raised by the appellant before us can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Having heard the submissions, we disagreed with the appellant on the first issue that the respondent was negligent in the preparation of the loan documentation. However, we agreed with the appellant on the second issue that the respondent was negligent in advising the appellant to release the loan amount in favour of the borrower's solicitors notwithstanding that cl 4 (p 354 Appeal Record) of the sale and purchase agreement ("S&amp;P") specifically provided that the purchase price was to be paid to the vendor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Consequently we unanimously allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court. We allowed the appellant's claim for special damages in the sum of RM193,200.00 as prayed for in para 19(i) and for interests as prayed for in para 19(iii) of the statement of claim. We ordered general damages as prayed for in para 19(ii) to be assessed. Costs of RM10,000.00 was awarded to the appellant and the deposit was ordered to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The respondent has filed a Notice of Motion to the Federal Court seeking leave to appeal. Bearing in mind that our decision on liability was based on our finding that the respondent was negligent in advising the appellant to release the loan sum to the borrower's solicitors and not to the vendor, our judgment will be confined to this finding only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Clause 4 of the S&amp;P reads as follows (p 354 of Appeal Record):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The said purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser in the manner as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It is not disputed that the respondent had sent a letter to the appellant dated 23 May 2001 and had advised the appellant that it was in order for the appellant to release the loan amount in favour of KY Lee. We take note that the learned JC had not made any finding on the appellant's claim that the respondent was negligent in giving its advice for the appellant to release the loan sum in favour of the borrower's solicitors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_216;"><i>Yap Ham Seow v. Fatimawati Ismail &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 216</LINK>; [2014] 1 MLJ 645; [2013] 9 CLJ 577; [2014] 2 AMR 301 this court dealt with the issue of the duty of care owed by a solicitor to his client. Raus Sharif FCJ in his judgment referred to the judgment of Gunn Chit Tuan J (as he then was) in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1983_1_175;"><i>Neogh Soo Oh &amp; Ors v. G Rethinasamy</i> [1983] 1 MLRH 175</LINK>; [1984] 1 MLJ 126; [1983] CLJ 663 wherein His Lordship said that "a solicitor's duty is to use reasonable care and skill in giving such advice and taking such action as the facts of a particular case demand".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In the present appeal, a perusal of the various letters written by KY Lee to the respondent appeared genuine and were nothing out of the ordinary such as to arouse any suspicion that the writer was not a conveyancing solicitor but a fraudster or that the transaction was fraudulent. Nevertheless cl 4 of the S&amp;P specifically stated that the loan sum was to be released to the vendor. By advising the appellant to release the loan sum to the borrower's solicitor, we found that the respondent had acted negligently by giving advice that was clearly contrary to the contractual provision even though it was the respondent's opinion that it was safe to do so since the demand drafts were to be paid into KY Lee's clients' account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On the evidence we found that the respondent was negligent in giving advice to the appellant that was contrary to the contractual provisions. The respondent's advice proved detrimental to the interests of the appellant and had caused loss of the loan sum of RM193,200.00, an amount that was not disputed. For the reasons aforesaid we allowed the appeal. 202</p>
