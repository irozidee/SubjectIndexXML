    <p>The appellant was arrested at the KLIA for carrying a bag which held two boxes containing dangerous drugs. He was charged with trafficking in dangerous drugs contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("DDA")</LINK>. At the end of the prosecution's case, the High Court reduced the charge to possession whereupon the appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fine. The prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeal which ordered the defence to be called on the original charge of trafficking. The appellant's defence in the High Court was one of innocent carrier. He stated that he had flown from New Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. At the New Delhi airport, a person named Faruk had given him the bag with instructions to hand it over to a person at KLIA. For such service, he was promised RM2,000.00. The trial judge however rejected the appellant's defence that he was an innocent carrier. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the decision of the High Court was affirmed. In the course of dismissing the appeal the Court of Appeal held that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">DDA</LINK> did not cater for the defence of 'innocent carrier'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the first Court of Appeal was satisfied that the prosecution had successfully proven the elements of custody, control, knowledge and trafficking. With its order to the High Court to hear the defence, there was absolutely no necessity for the High Court judge to reopen the matter and decide again whether a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established. All that was needed was for the trial judge to test that <i>prima facie</i> case against any evidence adduced by the appellant at the end of the trial. The judge had to take a maximum evaluation of the evidence, which he did. He analysed the total evidence adduced in the course of the trial in order to ascertain the substantive defence of innocent carrier. With no fresh evidence to substantiate his defence of being an innocent carrier the appellant was found guilty, convicted and sentenced. (para 6)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The defence of innocent carrier is a valid defence that may be alluded to by an accused person, as was in the case of the appellant. The success of the defence of innocent carrier depends very much on the facts of the case. Ignorance simpliciter is not sufficient to let an accused person off the hook. (paras 9-10)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the appellant was in a position to examine the contents of the bag entrusted to him by one Faruk before it was checked in but failed to do so. The appellant was clearly guilty of willful blindness. The appellant's willful conduct, compounded by his factual impecuniosity, made no sense to his defence hence leading to the inference that he knew the contents of the bag that he carried. The judge in the instant appeal had clearly addressed his mind to the defence of innocent carrier before concluding that such a defence based on the factual matrix failed to raise any reasonable doubt. (paras 11 &amp; 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The trial judge had not misdirected himself on the law. He had adequately considered the evidence both for the prosecution and the defence carefully in the course of his maximum evaluation, and had meticulously supplied his reasons as to why the prosecution's evidence was accepted over the defence, and why the solitary defence of innocent carrier was rejected. The conviction and sentence as imposed by the High Court was safe as affirmed by the Court of Appeal. There was no reason to interfere with the finding of facts of both courts except to rectify the erroneous view held by the Court of Appeal on the proposition of law regarding the defence of innocent carrier.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Suriyadi Halim Omar FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was arrested at the Unit Khas Pemeriksaan Penumpang (UKPP) of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for carrying a bag containing two boxes, later found to contain ketamine. He was later charged with trafficking in 20,077.1 grams of ketamine under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('the Act')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case the High Court reduced the charge to possession whereupon the appellant pleaded guilty and sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fine. Being dissatisfied, the prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was successful and the Court of Appeal (first Court of Appeal) ordered the defence to be called on the original charge of trafficking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the defence stage at the High Court, the appellant's defence was as follows. He came to Malaysia to meet his relatives and to buy electrical goods. His journey began at Chennai. From there he took a train to Bombay. He then flew down and transited at New Delhi airport. At the New Delhi airport, before flying off to KLIA that impugned bag was given to him by a person called Faruk, with the follow-up instruction that it be handed over to a person at KLIA. For that alleged simple service he was promised RM2,000.00. He eventually arrived at his final destination, ie KLIA whereat he was arrested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned trial judge however rejected the appellant's defence that he was an innocent carrier, which would have entitled him to an acquittal. As the appellant did not adduce fresh evidence despite the first Court of Appeal having found <i>mens rea</i> possession, the appellant thus had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case by depending solely on that defence of innocent carrier. The learned judge in the course of sifting through the total evidence, <i>inter alia</i>, stated that it was not reasonable to have been paid RM2,000.00 for that alleged service, let alone he had insufficient money to buy the electrical goods here. The appellant thereupon was convicted and sentenced to death for trafficking as per the original charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On appeal filed at the Court of Appeal the decision of the learned judge was affirmed. In the course of dismissing the appeal the Court of Appeal held that the Act did not cater for the defence of 'innocent carrier'. More of this erroneous view later. Being dissatisfied with the decision the appellant appealed to us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It must be reminded that the High Court in this case had heard the defence premised on the instruction of the first Court of Appeal to have the case heard based on the original charge. In ordinary parlance the first Court of Appeal was satisfied that the prosecution had successfully proven the element of custody, control, knowledge and the ingredient of trafficking in favour of the prosecution. It was common ground that the first Court of Appeal had never alluded to any presumptive provision when concluding that a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking as per the charge had been established. With such an order meted down to hear the defence there was absolutely no necessity for the learned judge to reopen the matter and decide again whether a <i>prima facie</i> case had indeed been established. All that was needed was for the learned judge to acquiesce to the order of the superior court and to test that <i>prima facie</i> case against any evidence adduced by the appellant at the end of the trial. In other words the learned judge must undertake a maximum evaluation of the evidence (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_547;"><i>Balachandran v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 547</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 301; [2005] 1 CLJ 85; [2005] 1 AMR 321). This the learned judge did. He analysed the total evidence adduced in the course of the trial in order to ascertain the substantive defence of innocent carrier. As said above, with no fresh evidence to substantiate his defence of being an innocent carrier the appellant was eventually found guilty, convicted and sentenced to death for trafficking as per the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue Of Innocent Carrier</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the issue of innocent carrier the Court of Appeal in its Grounds of Judgment at p 2 (para 3) had authored the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> At p 13 (para 16) again the Court of Appeal stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We were rather perturbed by the above remarks as that is not the correct proposition of law in drug trafficking cases. The defence of innocent carrier is a valid defence that could be alluded to by an accused person, and in this case the appellant. A plethora of cases sprinkles the legal journals in Malaysia and suffice if we merely refer to a chosen few to clarify this defence without the need for comprehensive judicial activism. The Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_680;"><i>Venkatesan Chinnasami v. PP</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 680</LINK> put it aptly in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> As said above it is imperative that the success of the defence of innocent carrier depends very much on the facts of each case, a matter that falls within the realm of the trial judge. Ignorance simpliciter is not sufficient to let an accused person off the hook as otherwise every other accused person will allude to that defence. It needs more than that. Without any reason for suspicion, or there is no right or opportunity of examination, ignorance may be a good defence. A hypothetical scenario could be when an accused person receives a package which contains illicit drugs from say, England when not a shred of evidence could establish him having been aware of the circumstances of the drugs being sent to him or having any nexus to him. Prior to the parcel appearing at his door step he would not have had any reason for suspicion or the opportunity to inspect the parcel bearing in mind that the package was beyond his reach until it reached his hands. The rider is that everything depends on the facts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Let us now peruse briefly at the relevant parts of the evidence regarding the current case where every opportunity was made available to the appellant to inspect the bag. It was noticeable that there was no suggestion by the defence that the appellant had enquired from the person who handed the two boxes to him or such a suggestion was made to any of the prosecution's witnesses of the contents. He was in a position to examine the contents of the bag entrusted by one Faruk before it was checked in but failed to do so. He was clearly guilty of willful blindness (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_358;"><i>Hoh Bon Tong v. PP</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 358</LINK>; [2010] 5 CLJ 240 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_715;"><i>PP v. Amil Akmad</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 715</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 561; [2007] 4 CLJ 688; [2004] 5 AMR 69). In <i>Hoh Bon Tong v. PP (supra)</i> when discussing this defence held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In order not to throttle the discretion of judges, let alone no cases are similar, we are loath to lay down the restrictive guidelines for courts to consider prior to deciding whether the defence of innocent carrier can prevail. We leave it to the better judgment of the presiding judge. In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_404;"><i>Marlan Marpaung v. PP</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 404</LINK>; [2013] 1 MLJ 108; [2012] 8 CLJ 41; [2013] 1 AMR 497 the court had occasion to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Appraising his written grounds, the learned judge in the current appeal had clearly addressed his mind to the defence of innocent carrier before concluding that such a defence based on the factual matrix failed to raise any reasonable doubt. He had clearly given consideration to the character of Faruk raised by the appellant, the illogicality of the appellant being promised RM2,000.00 for such an easy task (a factor which conspicuously weighed heavily in his mind), let alone there was insufficient money found on him to buy the electrical goods. The appellant's willful conduct, compounded by his factual impecuniosity, made no sense to his defence hence leading to the inference that he knew the contents of the bag that he carried.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> To summarise the total picture, as the first Court of Appeal had earlier concluded that the appellant had <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs found in the said bag, what with the appellant failing to adduce fresh evidence at the defence stage to rebut that conclusion, the defence of innocent carrier was clearly a non-starter. The credibility of the prosecution's witnesses together with the facts and circumstances of the case established, as opposed to the appellant's unsubstantiated claim that he did not know the contents of the bag, did not create any reasonable doubt in the mind of the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The ingredient of trafficking was established when the appellant carried the drugs from New Delhi airport to Kuala Lumpur (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Having heard the submissions from the contending parties, we found that the learned trial judge had not misdirected himself on the law. He had adequately considered the evidence both for the prosecution and the defence carefully in the course of his maximum evaluation, and had meticulously supplied his reasons as to why the prosecution's evidence was accepted over the defence, and why the solitary defence of innocent carrier was rejected. We found the conviction and sentence as imposed by the High Court safe as affirmed by the Court of Appeal subsequently. We saw no reason to interfere with the finding of facts of both courts except to rectify the erroneous view held by the Court of Appeal on the proposition of law regarding the defence of innocent carrier. But it must be clarified that despite the unintended error of the Court of Appeal the eventual decision was correct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We accordingly dismissed the appeal and confirmed the conviction and sentence meted down by the High Court and confirmed by the Court of Appeal.</p>
