    <p>The High Court dismissed the appellant's winding up petition against the respondent and the appellant's notice of application for extension of time to file, serve and use affidavits-in-reply to the affidavits to oppose the petition. The winding up petition was filed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(f) and (i) of the Companies Act 1965 ('Act')</LINK>, namely on the grounds (a) that the directors had acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the company as a whole which appeared to be unfair or unjust to the other members and (b) it was just and equitable that the company be wound up. The High Court found that there was a non-compliance of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;30.;;">r 30(2) of the Companies (Winding-Up) Rules 1972 (the 'Rules')</LINK> as the appellant's relevant affidavits-in-reply were filed out of time. The appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal against the dismissal of both the petition and the application for extension of time:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court did not consider the effects of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">rr 193</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">194 of the Rules</LINK>. The Rules must be read harmoniously, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">rr 193</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">194</LINK> must temper the rigours of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;30.;;">r 30</LINK>. Equally important, the High Court should have considered the current approach to non-compliance with rules of procedure as per <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;1A.;;">O 1A of the Rules of Court 2012 ('ROC')</LINK>. Although the ROC did not directly apply to the facts being a winding up matter, the current jurisprudence on the effects of non-compliance should not be completely ignored. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">Rule 194 of the Rules</LINK> was very clear that no proceedings under the Act or the Rules shall be invalidated by any formal defect or irregularity, unless the court was of the opinion that substantial injustice had been caused and that the injustice could not be remedied by any order of court. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">Rule 194</LINK> further provided that the court could on application extend time to do any act under the Rules. (paras 20-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The Court of Appeal decision of <i>Crocuses &amp; Daffodils (M) Sdn Bhd v. Development &amp; Commercial Bank Bhd</i> concerned a non-payment of debt in a normal banking scenario. The winding up was not based on a minority oppression, prejudicial unfair conduct or just and equitable winding up. In subsequent cases, it was highlighted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">r 193 of the Rules</LINK> was not referred to by the Court of Appeal in that case. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court was in error when failing to consider the fact that a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(f) and (i)</LINK> petition under the Act stood on a very different footing from that of a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(e)</LINK> petition under the same, and that in an unfair prejudicial conduct case where equitable considerations came into play, it was not possible or advisable for the court to adopt such a rigid approach on non-compliance. In such a case, it was not uncommon for the facts to be highly contested and cross-examination of deponents allowed. There would have been no injustice caused to the respondent had the application for extension of time been allowed for a proper consideration of all the evidence for justice to be done. (para 23)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court in Ipoh which dismissed the winding up petition in encl 1 against the respondent (Kilo Asset Sdn Bhd) with costs and further, dismissed the Notice of Application of the petitioner (Hiew Tai Hong) for extension of time to file, serve and use the affidavits in reply to the affidavits to oppose the petition in encl 17 with costs for the sum of RM70,000.00 payable by the petitioner, the appellant in this appeal, to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The dismissal of encl 17 led the learned Judicial Commissioner to then state that the two affidavits to oppose the petition had not been challenged, and therefore there was a sufficient explanation given by the respondent to conclude the allegations in the petition had no merits. In a very short judgment, the learned Judicial Commissioner applied the settled general principle in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_48;"><i>Ng Hee Thoong &amp; Anor v. Public Bank Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 48</LINK>; [1995] 1 MLJ 281; [2000] 1 AMR 407 that a failure to contradict a positive assertion in an affidavit is usually treated as an admission of it by the party who has failed to contradict it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> To quote the learned Judicial Commissioner in this context:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In terms of sequence and the affidavits filed, the affidavit in support of the petition of the appellant/petitioner was filed on 24 October 2010. Two affidavits in opposition followed (affirmed by Goh Cheng Kee and Mohd Mokhtar bin Ismail respectively and noted in the judgment of the High Court as affidavit no 1 and affidavit no 2), both filed on 6 December 2012. The petitioner then filed a reply affidavit together with a second affidavit in reply on 7 January 2013. On 14 January 2013, there was another affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioner and this was filed on 14 January 2013 (affidavit affirmed by Soh Siew Yeng). There were five other affidavits in opposition filed for the respondent on 11 January 2013 and 16 January 2013. When the High Court dismissed encl 17, the High Court merely decided on the basis of three affidavits. Seven other affidavits by the parties were ignored resulting from a non-compliance by the petitioner with procedure.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The particular rule of procedure singled out by the High Court is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;30.;;">r 30(2) of the Companies (Winding-Up) Rules 1972</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On the facts, it is evident that the three affidavits in reply were not filed within three days of the service of the two affidavits in opposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The winding up petition itself was filed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(f) and (i)</LINK>, namely on the grounds (a) the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the company as a whole which appears to be unfair or unjust to other members ("unfair conduct" ground) and (b) it is just and equitable that the company be wound up ("just and equitable" ground). This was not an ordinary petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(e)</LINK>, ie where "the company is unable to pay its debts".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On the record, this appeared to be a keenly contested petition between competing shareholders and directors, and had nothing to do with any non-payment of a debt due. The petition itself contain a detailed narration of the events leading to the dispute between the shareholders/directors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Perusing the petition, the appellant/petitioner is a Director and one of the shareholders of the respondent. The petitioner holds 75,000 shares representing 30% of the share capital. Goh Cheng Kee, is the major shareholder holding 150,000 shares representing 60% of the share capital. The remaining 10% of the share capital, comprising 25,000 shares, belongs to Mr Mohd Mokhtar Ismail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The respondent is principally engaged in property development.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant, who claims to have 30 years of experience in the construction and development industry, was persuaded by Goh Cheng Kee to join the respondent to develop a project known as "Baldwin Business Park" with Intervax Corporation Sdn Bhd as the landowner and the respondent as the developer. A joint venture contract was entered into by the respondent and Intervax Corporation Sdn Bhd on 14 April 2008 to develop the land in which the profit would be shared on a 77% and 23% basis respectively. It was agreed by the parties that the development would comprise two phases in which Phase 1 comprises 36 units and Phase 2 comprises 42 units and a commercial complex with 1 1/2 storey building thereon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Pursuant to the said joint venture, a supplemental agreement was entered on 12 July 2010 wherein a joint venture company was incorporated named Kilo Intervax Sdn Bhd. The shareholders of this company would be the respondent holding 77% of the paid-up share capital and Intervax Corporation Sdn Bhd holding 23% of the paid-up share capital. However, for the shareholders of the respondent, the profits would be distributed according to the shareholding of the shareholders in the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant claims that there was an agreement between him and Goh Cheng Kee whereby he will always be entitled to permanent representation on the Board of the respondent and all business decisions would be taken on equal basis between the two.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The dispute between these two shareholders is said to have been sparked when Goh Cheng Kee intended to appoint an independent sales team for the project, a decision which was strongly opposed by the appellant. According to the appellant's argument, besides incurring additional expenses to the respondent, the appointment of an independent sales team was not needed as the respondent already had its own sales team. Further, on 18 September 2012, a Circular Resolution was issued by Goh Cheng Kee which sought to change the respondent's mandate to the bank on signatories to cheques by naming himself as the sole signatory for the respondent's account with Hong Leong Bank Berhad. On top of that, the appellant also avers that business decisions of the respondent have been made by Goh Cheng Kee without even consulting him and thus worsened the relationship between them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Being aggrieved, the appellant wrote a letter, through his solicitors, to Goh Cheng Kee setting out his grievances with an offer for the sale of his shares to Goh Cheng Kee at the price of RM3,200,000.00, or for the purchase of the Goh Cheng Kee's shares at RM6,400,000.00. Goh Cheng Kee negotiated to purchase the appellant's shares at RM2,029,335.00 for Phase 2 and informed that Phase 1 would only be distributed after an audit was conducted on the profits of Phase 1. From Goh Cheng Kee's conduct, the appellant alleges Goh Cheng Kee has refused to purchase his shares at the price offered or even sell his shares at the higher price as offered by the appellant, and thus the only recourse for him is to apply to have the respondent wound up.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(f) and/or s 218(1)(i) of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>, the appellant filed the petition to wind up the respondent on the grounds stated earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In his affidavit to oppose the appellant's petition, Goh Cheng Kee denied all the appellant's allegations against him. According to him, there was no reason for him to sabotage their own company and he had no problems working with the appellant. Goh Cheng Kee also denied having any agreement whatsoever with the appellant in giving him the permanent representation on the respondent's Board. By filing this petition, according to Goh Cheng Kee, the appellant was trying to force him to buy the appellant's shares at the appellant's price. Further, Goh Cheng Kee averred that the appellant has no grounds whatsoever to wind up the respondent which is a healthy, profit-making company. Goh Cheng Kee's averments in his affidavit is supported by the affidavit affirmed by Mohd Mokhtar Ismail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As earlier indicated, the appellant filed the affidavits in reply to these affidavits respectively, but these were out of time. The appellant then filed a Notice of Application pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">r 193</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">r 194 Companies (Winding-Up) Rules 1972 ('the Winding-Up Rules')</LINK> for an extension of time to file, serve and use his affidavits and other affidavits filed by him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As seen above, the learned Judicial Commissioner found that there was a non-compliance of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;30.;;">r 30(2) Companies (Winding-Up) Rules 1972</LINK>, and dismissed the application for extension of time (encl 17) and dismissed the petition consequently.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It did not appear to us that the learned Judicial Commissioner even considered the effects of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">r 193</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">r 194</LINK>, although these were submitted before him as included in the written submission of counsel for the petitioner in the High Court. The Winding-Up Rules, in our opinion, have to be read harmoniously, and the rigours of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;30.;;">r 30</LINK> must be tempered by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">r 193</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">r 194</LINK>, and equally important, the High Court should have considered the current approach to non-compliance with rules of procedure, as reflected in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;1A.;;">O 1A of the Rules of Court 2012 ('ROC 2012')</LINK> that a "court or judge shall have regard to justice of the particular case and not only to the technical non-compliance". Although ROC 2012 does not directly apply on the facts, this being a winding up matter, the current jurisprudence on the effects of non-compliance should not be completely ignored.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">Rule 194 of the Winding-Up Rules</LINK> is very clear on this: "... no proceedings under the Act or the Rules shall be invalidated by any formal defect or any irregularity, unless the court is of the opinion substantial injustice has been caused ... and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of court". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">Rule 193</LINK> further provided, the court can on application extend the time to do any act under these Winding-Up Rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In the course of the submissions, counsel for the appellant indicated to us that the High Court's decision was influenced by the line of authorities as reflected by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_328;"><i>Crocuses &amp; Daffodils (M) Sdn Bhd v. Development &amp; Commercial Bank Bhd</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 328</LINK>; [1997] 2 MLJ 756; [1997] 3 CLJ 485; [1997] 3 AMR 2321. To start with, this Court of Appeal's decision concerns a non-payment of debt in a normal banking scenario. The winding up is not based on minority oppression, prejudicial or unfair conduct or just and equitable winding up. Secondly, and this has been highlighted in subsequent cases, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;193.;;">r 193</LINK> was not referred to by the Court of Appeal then.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The High Court was, in our opinion, in error when the learned Judicial Commissioner failed to direct his mind to the fact that a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(f) and (i)</LINK> stands on a very different footing from a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218(1)(e)</LINK> petition, and that in an unfair or prejudicial conduct case where equitable considerations invariably would come into play, it will not be possible or advisable for the court to adopt such a rigid approach on non-compliance. In such a case, it is not uncommon for the facts to be highly contested and cross-examination of deponents allowed. We did not believe any injustice would have been caused to the respondent had the High Court allowed the application for extension of time, so that there will be a proper consideration of all the evidence for justice to be done.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Thus, we were of the unanimous opinion that in respect of Appeal No: A-02(IM)-1230-05-2013 (in respect of the dismissal of encl 17), this appeal should be allowed as it was in the interest of justice to do so. The judgment of the High Court was set aside and orders in terms of prayers (a) and (b) only of encl 17 were to be entered.</p>
    <p>Consequently, in respect of Appeal No: A-02(IM)-1231-05-2013 (dismissal of the petition), this appeal was also allowed with a further order that the winding up petition be remitted back to the High Court for a full hearing. The judgment of the High Court was set aside.</p>
    <p>Costs were ordered to be costs in the cause, with the deposit refunded to the appellant.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
