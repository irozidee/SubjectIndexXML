    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant had been caught with drugs on his person by police personnel and was charged with the offence of trafficking in dangerous drugs. At the end of the prosecution's case, the trial judge had made a finding that the appellant had custody, control and knowledge of the drugs and that the prosecution could prove knowledge and presume trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("DDA")</LINK> or presume knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> and prove trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 DDA</LINK>. Having found that the prosecution had proven a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant, the trial judge called upon the appellant to enter on his defence. The trial judge found that the defence version was not probable, reasonable or logical and that it did not cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. Consequently, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to death. Dissatisfied, the appellant filed the present appeal contending, <i>inter alia</i>, that the trial judge erred in invoking and relying on two different issues of law, ie knowledge and presumed trafficking or presumed knowledge and trafficking in coming to the conclusion that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs; the trial judge made two separate findings of trafficking without stating the law which was relied upon; the trial judge had not considered the issue of conduct and duress; and the trial judge had failed to evaluate whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption at the end of the defence case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Having perused the grounds of judgment as a whole, the trial judge had made a finding that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs and that finding was not based on the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK>. As for trafficking, the trial judge had found trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 DDA</LINK>. By adverting to both knowledge and presumed trafficking or presumed knowledge and trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 DDA</LINK>, the trial judge was merely reiterating the option that the prosecution had in proving their case against the appellant. The trial judge had found knowledge and trafficking without resorting to any of the presumptions. There was therefore no issue of misdirection and neither was there any miscarriage of justice occasioned to the appellant. (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The evidence against the appellant was overwhelming. He was caught with the drugs on his person. The trial judge did consider the appellant's defence before coming to the conclusion that the defence was not credible or logical and that it had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. In the instant case, while conduct was relevant to infer knowledge, considering the totality of the evidence, the finding of the trial judge that conduct was irrelevant, did not occasion any miscarriage of justice to the appellant. Nowhere in the grounds of judgment was the word 'duress' mentioned. Furthermore, the defence of the appellant that he was forced to carry the drugs had been examined by the trial judge. Accordingly, there was no merit in the grounds raised and the conviction was safe. (paras 16-18)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The charge against the appellant reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 1 July 2011 at about 9.30am, SP5 whilst on observation duty at the International Arrival Hall, KLIA with SP4 and one Alfisyah bin Mazlan, a police personnel, saw the appellant walking 'mundar mandir' raising the suspicion of SP5. SP5 directed SP4 to examine the bag carried by the appellant. The bag did not contain anything illegal. SP5 asked the appellant a few questions. The answers given do not tally with the E-ticket (exh P19) found on the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant was then taken to the Cawangan Pemeriksaan Penumpang 1, where a physical examination was done. When SP4 pulled up the trousers of the appellant, SP4 saw a transparent plastic packet attached to the left and the right calf of the appellant (exhs P13b(1) and P13b(2) respectively). The two packets were attached to the appellant by a pair of stockings, a knee guard and an ankle guard on each side. Upon analysis, the chemist (SP3) confirmed the substances found in the packets to be 1,131.5 grams of heroin and 55.5 grams of monoacethymorphines.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case, the learned trial judge made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> As for trafficking, the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Having found that the prosecution had proven a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant, the learned trial judge called upon the appellant to enter on his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In his evidence given from the dock, the appellant's defence in essence was that he was forced to carry the drugs. He stated that he came from Pakistan; that in Pakistan, he was caught and held captive; that his mother and sister were kidnapped; that someone had placed the packets on his legs; that he was told it was 'flour for medical reasons' and that all the way when he was on the flight, he felt that someone was watching him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned trial judge found that the defence version was not probable, reasonable or logical and that it had not cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death, hence the appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant raised the following grounds of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The first and the second issues are interrelated. They concerned the manner the learned trial judge dealt with the issue of knowledge and trafficking. We noted that the learned trial judge had stated that the prosecution had proved knowledge. In our view, the correct approach would be to state whether the prosecution had proved possession. Knowledge is but one of the elements of possession. The other elements of possession are custody and control. Knowledge, as has been said in a long line of authorities, is not something which can be proved by direct evidence. It can only be proved by inference from the surrounding circumstances (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_44;"><i>Chan Pean Leon v. PP</i> [1956] 1 MLRH 44</LINK>; [1956] 1 MLJ 237, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_180;"><i>Gunalan Ramachandran &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 180</LINK>; [2004] 4 MLJ 489; [2004] 4 CLJ 551; [2004] 6 AMR 189, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_93;"><i>Sia Pang Liong v. PP</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 93</LINK>; [2011] 6 CLJ 759).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Coming back to the grounds of judgment of the learned trial judge, Her Ladyship had stated that the prosecution may prove knowledge and presumed trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> or the prosecution may presume knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> and prove trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The complaint of learned counsel was that whilst the prosecution has the option, the learned trial judge, as the final arbiter, had to make a finding whether knowledge had been inferred or presumed upon the appellant. The same argument applies for the element of trafficking. It was submitted that the learned trial judge must make a finding on the provision of law which the learned trial judge had relied upon to find trafficking. If the learned trial judge had invoked the presumption of trafficking, then the next complaint was that the learned trial judge had failed to evaluate whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption at the end of the defence case. The failure of the learned trial judge to make such finding, submitted learned counsel, was a grave misdirection by way of non-direction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> As regards the third issue, to negate knowledge, it was suggested to the prosecution's witnesses that the appellant did not attempt to run away but had given his cooperation. It was the finding of the learned trial judge that the conduct was irrelevant as the drugs were attached to the appellant's body. Learned counsel submitted that the learned trial judge had brushed aside the issue of conduct. The conduct of the appellant in not attempting to run away and had given his cooperation, submitted learned counsel, had rebutted the presumption and inference of knowledge that had been drawn against the appellant. It was further the submission of learned counsel that the learned trial judge had failed to consider the defence of duress.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In respect of the first and the second issue, at first glance, there seemed to be some force in the submissions of learned counsel that the learned trial judge had failed to make a finding as to whether knowledge was inferred on the appellant or whether knowledge was presumed. The same goes for the finding on trafficking. It appears that having discussed <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> and having found that the act of the appellant amounted to keeping, concealing, transporting and carrying the drugs under the definition of trafficking, the learned trial judge then proceeded to state that "As such trafficking was proven by either direct evidence or by invoking <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the DDA</LINK>.", thus giving the impression that there was no finding made on whether trafficking was presumed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> or trafficking was proved under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> However, having perused the grounds of judgment as a whole, we find that the learned trial judge did make a finding that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs and the finding was not based on presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. This was clear where Her Ladyship had stated that "... this would surely infer that the accused had knowledge." As for trafficking, reading the grounds of judgment left us in no doubt that the learned trial judge had found trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>. By adverting to both knowledge and presumed trafficking or presumed knowledge and trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2</LINK>, the learned trial judge in our view, was merely reiterating the option that the prosecution had in proving their case against the appellant. We are satisfied that the learned trial judge had found knowledge and trafficking without resorting to any of the presumptions. There was therefore no issue of misdirection by way of non-direction by the learned trial judge and neither was there any miscarriage of justice occasioned to the appellant. Consequently, the complaint that the learned trial judge had failed to evaluate whether the appellant has rebutted the presumption at the end of the defence case could not be sustained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The evidence against the appellant was overwhelming. He was caught with the drugs on his person. The appellant gave a statement from the dock. The learned trial judge accepted that the statement from the dock was evidence although its veracity was not tested and that the evidence would have to be examined to see whether it could raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_416;"><i>Azahan Mohd Aminallah v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 416</LINK>; [2005] 5 MLJ 334; [2005] 1 CLJ 374; [2004] 6 AMR 810). The learned trial judge did consider the defence before coming to the conclusion that the defence was not credible or logical and that it has failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. We find no reason to disagree with the finding of the learned trial judge in this respect (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1948_1_160;"><i>Tan Seng Ann v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1948] 1 MLRA 160</LINK>; [1949] 1 MLJ 87, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_156;"><i>Chu Tak Fai v. PP</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 156</LINK>; [1998] 4 MLJ 246; [1998] 4 CLJ 789; [2006] 6 AMR 721 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_5_584;"><i>Koh Keng Guan v. PP</i> [2009] 5 MLRA 584</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 137; [2012] 10 CLJ 96).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Further, while we agree that conduct is relevant to infer knowledge, in the instant case, considering the totality of the evidence, the finding of the learned trial judge that conduct was irrelevant, has similarly not occasioned any miscarriage of justice to the appellant. And notwithstanding the fact that nowhere in the grounds of judgment was the word 'duress' mentioned, we find that the learned trial judge had examined the defence version that he was forced to carry the drugs. This is what Her Ladyship said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Based on the foregoing, we found no merit in the grounds raised by learned counsel for the appellant. In our judgment, the conviction is safe. We therefore unanimously dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence of the High Court.</p>
