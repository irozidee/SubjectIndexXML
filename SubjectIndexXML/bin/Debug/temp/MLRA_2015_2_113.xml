    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant entered into an agreement ("the JVSA") dated 30 May 1995 with the respondents to incorporate a limited liability company ("the company") to run a private hospital ("Penawar") with diagnostic facilities for inpatients and outpatients. The respondents held 70% shareholding in the company whereas the appellant held the remaining 30%. Sometime in October 2009, the respondents discovered that the appellant was setting up another private hospital ("the New Hospital") within a 1km radius from Penawar, offering the same medical services as Penawar. The respondents objected to this New Hospital on the basis of unfair competition and conflict of interest on the part of the appellant. The appellant, however, argued that contractually there was no provision to prohibit competition between them and there were sufficient safeguards in the JVSA to prevent conflicts of interest. Further, there was a sufficient market in the area to cater for both hospitals. The respondents sued the appellant for breach of the express and implied terms of the JVSA, breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the appellant, and for loss of future profits. The High Court granted judgment in favour of the respondents. The High Court allowed the respondents' several declarations to the effect that the appellant's actions in establishing the New Hospital constituted a breach of fiduciary duties owed to the respondents. The High Court further ordered a sum of RM70,486,000.00 be paid as damages to the respondents. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The respondents also cross-appealed against the High Court's award of RM70,486,000.00, stating that the award should have been a higher sum of RM91,124,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs but dismissing the cross-appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The JVSA contained no express provision qualifying or derogating from the normal rules of the company, as expressed in the articles of association, that dividends had to be declared out of profits as recommended by the directors with the proviso that the directors may set aside sums that they might think proper as reserves to be properly applied in the business of the company or for investment from time to time as they might think fit. The effect of the High Court judgment nullified these rules, and the overriding principle of law underpinning these rules that shareholders "have no interest, legal or beneficial over the property" of the company. Profits are assets of the company and it was, with respect, erroneous for the High Court to have ignored this fundamental principle of company law. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Being based on estimated losses and projections, the sums claimed as loss of profits could not be classified as "special damages" for the short reason that they had not been actually incurred, nor capable of exact calculation. The respondents' claim was thus fundamentally flawed. (para 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court placed too high an emphasis on fiduciary duties being a <i>sine qua non</i> of a joint venture, and in so doing had not properly considered the joint-venture on the facts of the instant appeal being essentially a commercial joint-venture, where elements of partnership between the parties were expressly excluded by agreement. It therefore became a matter of construction of the commercial contract between the parties to ascertain the scope of the fiduciary duties owed by the appellant to the respondents. In the context of the instant appeal, the scope of fiduciary duties could not be extended to the extent of rewriting the contract between the parties in the respondents' favour, and it had to be borne in mind, the respondents were majority shareholders and in control of management. In such a situation, it was best for the commercial conflicts between the parties to be resolved through the mechanisms provided in the JVSA itself, and not supplant these contractual provisions by equitable doctrines. The proper function was to uphold the bargain of the parties as expressed in the written agreement between them. (para 41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Concerning the appellant's argument relating to the respondents not being "proper parties" based on the <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> doctrine, this was not the right approach to adopt. On the facts, and bearing in mind the joint venture relationship, if a breach could be substantiated, obviously the respondents as joint venturers would stand to lose their expected share of the profits through dividends payments. The alleged injury arising from the competition from the New Hospital would affect both the company as well as the joint venturers/ shareholders. As a matter of procedure, this argument by the appellant had no merit. (para 42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Concerning the technical points raised by the respondents with regard to the issues on the "proper party", the flaw in claiming for expected loss of profits instead of dividends, and the failure of the respondents to terminate the JVSA prior to claiming for damages for expected loss of profits, and the exact fiduciary relationship between the parties, these issues did not have merit in the circumstances of the appeal. These grounds were essentially issues of law that did not require the adduction of additional evidence beyond what had already been received during trial. These were fundamental issues of law on admitted facts that were not in controversy. It was within the court's discretion to allow the submissions in the interest of justice bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of the case. (para 43)</p>

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A. The Parties And Introductory Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The High Court entered judgment against the appellant (the defendant below) for breach of the express and implied terms of an agreement described as "Joint Venture Agreement Incorporating Shareholders Agreement" (hereafter "JVSA") dated 30 May 1995, entered into between the appellant and the two respondents (the plaintiffs below). The appellant is a company incorporated to primarily carry on business of managing agents for hospitals, clinics, maternity and nursing homes in Malaysia or elsewhere, and to provide administration, management, financial advice and other services to these hospitals and clinics. The 1st and 2nd respondents are siblings; the 1st respondent is a medical doctor whilst the 2nd respondent is an accountant by profession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The JVSA was entered into so as to incorporate a limited liability company - Hospital Penawar Sdn Bhd - to run a private hospital known as Hospital Penawar which was set up with an initial capacity of 40 beds together with diagnostic facilities for inpatients and outpatients. Hospital Penawar, as a privately-run hospital, commenced operation in 1997, but had existed earlier under a different name - (Hospital Adnan Sulaiman Sdn Bhd) - and a different ownership. Pursuant to the JVSA, the respondents together hold 70% of the shareholding (1st respondent: 45%; 2nd respondent: 25%) in the joint venture company managing the private hospital. The appellant holds the remaining 30%. At Board level, the respondents have a controlling majority, with two directors appointed by the 1st respondent, one by the 2nd respondent and two by the appellant. The 2nd respondent has been appointed the Managing Director of the Company since September 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Sometime in October 2009, the respondents discovered, through "market talk", that the appellant was setting up another private hospital called "Pasir Gudang Specialist Hospital Sdn Bhd" ("New Hospital") within a 1 km radius from Hospital Penawar, and offering the same medical services. The respondents objected to this since the New Hospital would be offering the same services within the same area and would be unfairly competing with Hospital Penawar. There would arise a conflict of interest on the part of the appellant. The appellant, however, argued that contractually there was no provision to prohibit competition between them, there were sufficient safeguards in the JVSA to prevent conflicts of interest, and there was a sufficient market in the Pasir Gudang area to cater for both. The respondents then sued the appellant for breach of the express and implied terms of the JVSA, breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the appellant, and for loss of future profits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The Recital in the JVSA specifies, <i>inter alia</i>, that the parties "are desirous of combining their respective resources and expertise for their mutual benefit in the business", "are desirous of forming a Joint Venture Company ... for the purpose of pursuing and effecting the aforesaid intentions", and that the parties "have agreed that the JVC shall carry on the business of establishing and managing a private hospital having an initial capacity of 40 beds and including diagnostic facilities on inpatients and outpatients". Under article IV of the JVSA, the appellant represents, warrants and covenants that it "shall assist in the incorporation of the JVC and to obtain all relevant approval required for the incorporation of the JVC, and further that it "shall provide financial and other support in pursuance of the objectives of the JVC". The respondents, on their part, agree that they "shall undertake the necessary marketing and promotion to ensure the smooth running of the business", and "shall provide financial and other support in pursuance of the objectives of the JVC". Article XVIII, cl 4 in turn provides that "in all cases they shall each of them use their best endeavours to ensure that this agreement shall operate as between themselves fairly and equitably".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It was not disputed that the appellant was in the business of managing and providing services to privately-run hospitals, and that it has a very large capitalisation of RM4 billion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>B. The Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In the High Court below, judgment in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs was entered after a full trial, for the following orders (1) a declaration that the appellant/defendant in constructing and establishing the Pasir Gudang Hospital Sdn Bhd was in breach of the express and implied terms of the JVSA, (2) a declaration that the defendant's action in constructing and establishing the said Pasir Gudang Hospital Sdn Bhd constituted a breach of fiduciary duties of the defendant to the plaintiffs, and (3) an order that a sum of RM70,486,000.00 was to be paid as damages by the defendant to the plaintiffs with interest at 5% per annum on that amount as from 1 May 2013 until full satisfaction. Costs of RM150,000.00 were ordered against the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C. The Pleadings For Damages And Declaration</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> As far as the pleadings are concerned, the prayers for relief in the statement of claim read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> From the terms of the pleadings, it will thus be seen that the High Court awarded "special damages" at the lower figure of RM70,486,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Joint Venture Company itself (Hospital Penawar Sdn Bhd) was not named as a party in the litigation, the action being between the immediate joint venturers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>D. Decision Of This Court </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> After hearing submissions by counsel of the parties, and considering the evidence and the law as disclosed in the Appeal Record, we came to a unanimous finding that there were serious misdirections in law by the High Court which invited appellate intervention by us, and thus we allowed the appeal with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The respondents filed a cross-appeal as well, by which they appealed against the order of the High Court on the quantum of damages awarded, stating that it should have been the higher sum of RM91,124,000.00, as pleaded by them, and disclosed in the "expert's" report tendered to court. The cross-appeal was also consequently dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We now provide our full grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>E. The High Court's Grounds Of Judgment</b>
    </p>
    <p>[13] In a comprehensive judgment that explored the legal position of parties in a joint venture, the High Court came to a firm finding, based principally on the Supreme Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_163;"><i>Newacres Sdn Bhd v. Sri Alam Sdn Bhd</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 163</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 474; [1991] 1 CLJ 321; [2000] 2 AMR 1730, that the relationship between these parties was fiduciary in nature. The court rejected the argument that this outcome had to be dependent on the existence of a partnership, but opted for the broader proposition that a fiduciary relationship was a <i>sine qua non</i> of any joint venture arrangement, borrowing freely from an online dictionary definition ("The Free Dictionary") which described a joint venture as such. This definition was said to be in accord with the decision in <i>Newacres Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>. The High Court held at p 8 of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In contrast with this broad proposition, the High Court appeared also to rely on the Court of Appeal decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_563;"><i>Tengku Abdullah Ibni Sultan Abu Bakar &amp; Ors v. Mohd Latiff Shah Mohd &amp; Ors &amp; Other Appeals</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 563</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 265; [1997] 2 CLJ 607; [1996] 2 AMR 2633, where the Court of Appeal outlined the factors that were indicative of a fiduciary relationship, namely, (a) the existence of a relationship of confidence which may be abused, (b) inequality of bargaining power, and (c) instances of vulnerability. The High Court in fact acknowledged that "whether or not a fiduciary relationship exists depends on the facts of the case and that the categories of fiduciary duties are never closed" (at p 8 of the judgment). As for the scope of fiduciary duties in the context of joint-ventures, the High Court again relied on <i>Tengku Abdullah Ibni Sultan Abu Bakar &amp; Ors v. Mohd Latiff Shah Mohd &amp; Ors &amp; Other Appeals (supra)</i>, and its approval of the minority judgment of Mason J in the Australian High Court case of <i>Hospital Products Ltd v. United States Surgical Corp &amp; Ors</i> [1984] 156 CLR 41, and the proposition that "it is now acknowledged generally that the scope of fiduciary duty must be moulded according to the nature of the relationship and the facts of the case". Delving into the scope of fiduciary duties between the appellant and the respondents on the facts, the learned trial judge concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> While acknowledging the agreement did not contain a guarantee of profits, nevertheless in the view of the High Court, the appellant could not act in a way that undermined "the very foundation" of the fiduciary relationship which was "based on mutual trust and confidence". To the High Court, the conflict of interest was obvious since the appellant as a shareholder would have access to pricing information, business modules and trade secrets of the JVC. In short, the trial judge said, "the competition will be on unfair terms as the defendant is privy to all confidential information on Hospital Penawar which it could use to its advantage whereas the plaintiffs do not have such advantage over the new hospital", citing supporting propositions of law established in <i>United Dominions Corp Ltd v. Brian Pty Ltd</i> [1985] 59 ALJR 676 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_3_59;"><i>Haw Par Brothers International Ltd &amp; Anor v. Jack Chiarapurk &amp; Ors</i> [1991] 3 MLRH 59</LINK>; [1991] 2 MLJ 428; [1991] 4 CLJ 833.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Noting that three out of 12 consultants of Hospital Penawar had been "lured" by the New Hospital, and as at the date of trial, six consultants had tendered their resignations from Hospital Penawar, and as at 2013, five specialists had tendered their resignations, the learned trial judge concluded that there could be no doubt that the New Hospital was a threat to Hospital Penawar, and "by extension" to the respondents who were the majority shareholders.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The High Court dismissed the argument, as testified by SD1 (the Corporate Manager of the appellant), that the New Hospital was not a threat to Hospital Penawar, but was "complementing" the services of the latter. In the same vein, the High Court dismissed the argument that the "zoning approval" granted to the appellant by the Ministry of Health showed that the healthcare facilities available in the Pasir Gudang area were insufficient and therefore there was a need for an additional hospital. The High Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Having found for the respondents on the issue of liability, the High Court adopted the lower amount proposed as foreseeable and recoverable damages by the report by SP4 (Andrew Heng) - the Ferrier Hodgson MH Report ("FHMH Report"). The court accepted SP4, a chartered accountant and a member of the Malaysian Bar, as an expert, and noted that the report had not been challenged by any other expert, the appellant having failed to call their own expert.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The quantum of damages was pegged to projected loss of profits expected to be suffered by Hospital Penawar for a period of 16 years (2013 to 2029) based on a factor of 70% of shareholding. The 16 years' duration was arrived at on the basis that it would take Hospital Penawar between approximately 16 to 19 years to revert to its original business level prior to the establishment of the New Hospital. The starting basis was the Income Statement forecast for year ending 2013 to year ending 2029, and a Gross Profit Margin of between 29% and 35%. The High Court analysed SP4's calculations as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The HRMH Report itself, in analysing the "Market Share post commencement of PGSH will vary from 30% to 50%", states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The actual calculations and workings based on these "assumptions" are detailed in Annexure 7 of the report (pp 1154 -1156, Appeal Record, Part C). In the "maximum loss" scenario, for years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019, the calculations project losses for the Hospital's Profit After Tax, on the basis of a drop in revenue of 60%, 70%, 65%, 60% and 55%. These assumptions and projected figures are expressly mentioned in the report as based on copies of Financial Statements and Audit Reports of Hospital Penawar from 1997 to 2011 and an Excel copy of the income statement forecasts/projections from 2012 to 2019 supplied by the respondents. At p 999, Appeal Record, Part C, the HRHM Report candidly states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As noted earlier in this judgment, the High Court adopted the lower estimated figure, but it appeared to us that no specific reason was given, or explained by the learned trial judge, why the lower figure was chosen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>F. The Submisssions </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Submission</b>
    </p>

      <b>[23]</b> In summary, the appellant's submission was pitched on the fundamental point in company law that only the affected company (Hospital Penawar Sdn Bhd) could be the proper plaintiff to sue for projected loss of profits caused to it by the setting up of the New Hospital by the defendant, not the respondents who were mere shareholders entitled merely to dividends out of the profits, if and when declared by the company. Unless their personal rights are directly affected, they could only institute this action by way of a derivative action in a situation where the directors or the controllers of the company failed or refuse to sue for the projected loss of profits, but, on the facts here, the respondents were in a dominant position in the administration of the company, both at shareholders' and board level. Our attention was particularly drawn to the decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_4_210;"><i>Pioneer Haven Sdn Bhd v. Ho Hup Construction Company Berhad &amp; Anor And Other Appeals</i> [2012] 4 MLRA 210</LINK>; [2012] 5 CLJ 169, where similarly the claim was brought by Ho Hup Construction Company, a 70% shareholder of a company, Bukit Jalil Development Sdn Bhd, that entered into a development agreement with the defendant company, Pioneer Haven Sdn Bhd, to rescind the development agreement on the ground, <i>inter alia</i>, that prior shareholders' approval had not been obtained for the agreement to be entered into. In <i>Pioneer Haven (supra)</i>, it was held:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> This was an argument reverting to basic principles of company law as laid down in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> [1843] 2 Hare 461, as clarified further in <i>Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v. Newman Industries Ltd (No 2)</i> [1982] 1 All ER 354, that a shareholder cannot sue to enforce a company's rights, unless his personal rights are infringed. On the facts of this appeal, the calculation of damages was based on projected losses to Hospital Penawar, and thus the proper plaintiff should be that company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Coupled with this argument was the other argument advanced that a shareholder is not entitled to claim for profits made by the company; he is entitled to only claim for dividends out of the profits when declared. Profits are the assets of the company, not of the shareholder. Counsel referred us to the following authorities: <i>Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd &amp; Others</i> [1925] AC 619, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_3_581;"><i>In Re Kang Chong Yeow, Ex P Mivan Far East Sdn Bhd</i> [2001] 3 MLRH 581</LINK>; [2001] 3 MLJ 98; [2001] 8 CLJ 226, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_169;"><i>Hew Sook Ying v. Hiw Tin Hee</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 169</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 189; [1992] 1 CLJ 120 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_317;"><i>Perman Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. European Commodities Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 317</LINK>; [2006] 1 MLJ 97; [2005] 4 CLJ 750; [2006] 1 AMR 115. In particular,this court held in <i>Perman Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, approving <i>Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd &amp; Others (supra)</i>, that a principle which lies at the heart of company law is that a company is a separate legal person from its shareholders, and that the shareholders "have no interest, legal or beneficial over the property of the former". In <i>Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd &amp; Others (supra)</i>, the House of Lords held:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> On the breach of fiduciary duties claimed by the respondents, the appellant denied a fiduciary relationship existed between the shareholders, or even between the appellant, as shareholder, and the company, citing in support the Australian case of <i>Peter's American Delicacy Co Ltd v. Heath</i> [1939] 61 CLR 457. Nevertheless, a concession was made by counsel in his written submission in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It would seem from counsel's submission that the appellant's position was not based on a complete denial that a fiduciary relationship could exist between joint venture parties, but rather more a position that on the facts of this case, and bearing in mind the terms and circumstances of the JVSA, such a relationship could not be said to exist. Counsel was careful to impress on us that the joint venture on the facts of this case was not a "traditional" joint venture, but was a purely "commercial" joint venture, where the parties consciously agreed in the agreement that the relationship was not to be that of a "partnership". Article XVII of the JVSA was clear on this, providing:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> As regards the damages claimed and awarded by the High Court on the lower scale, the appellant denied that there was any breach of the JVSA since it was in the contemplation of the respondents that the appellant was in the business of providing services to privately-run hospitals, and the JVSA itself did not contain any non-competition clause, which the parties could have provided for. Further, the appellant had applied for and obtained approval from the Ministry of Health to set up the new hospital, and since the Ministry of Health was convinced that there was room for another hospital, there was no issue of any unequal or unfair competition. To quote from the written submission on this point:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Turning to the quantum and the basis on which the damages were awarded, the appellant denied the damages for loss of profits here could be said to be a claim for "special damages", and further, cast doubt on the veracity and accuracy of the calculations which led to the award of RM70,486,000.00 and interest thereon, arguing that the calculations were based on "estimates" and "projections" that had not been independently verified. The entire FHMH Report was argued to be "nothing more than an estimation and projection that is premised on a dubious basis".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is best to quote exactly what was submitted for better clarity:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Lastly, an additional argument was advanced based on the non-termination of the JVSA by the respondents. The proper course for the respondents to take would be to terminate the JVSA and then claim for the damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondents' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The respondents took a technical argument in relation to three of the principal grounds raised by the appellant which corresponded to Grounds 1, 5, 6, 15, 17 and 21 in the Memorandum of Appeal, arguing that these were unpleaded in the defence. These grounds were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In particular, these grounds were not raised at trial, and it was not permissible to raise them at the appellate stage. As for the failure to terminate the JVSA, the respondents' stand was that they had a right in law to elect, consistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;40.;;">s 40 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Quite apart from these technical objections, the respondents maintained they were entitled to claim for the future loss of profits since these were calculated by an expert based on documents of Hospital Penawar. These were foreseeable damages claimable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Contracts Act</LINK>. It was a finding of fact by the High Court that these damages were within the contemplation of the parties, and this finding should not be disturbed. All the relevant source documents pertaining to the calculation of the damages were received in evidence, and were marked and admitted through the expert report. Further, the appellant had failed to call its own expert to challenge the expert report. The appellant had attempted to call the independent director of Hospital Penawar to be its witness but this was disallowed by the High Court. The appeal from this decision did not succeed in the Court of Appeal which dismissed the appeal. There was no application made thereafter to obtain leave to appeal to the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The High Court was satisfied that SP-4 had been independent and fair in his conclusions. The figures used in the projections came from Hospital Penawar and these were never disputed by the appellant as a shareholder. The respondents referred in support to the answers given by SP-4 in his testimony who explained why there was no need for an independent verification of the figures. See the following part of SP-4's testimony during cross-examination which was highlighted to us by counsel for the respondents in the submissions:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>G. Evaluation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We gave due consideration to the opposing submissions, particularly in relation to the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the appellant and the respondents as joint venturers, and considered the full implications of acceding to the conclusions of the High Court on the award of the pleaded "special damages" for projected loss of profits for 16 years which came to a tidy sum of RM70,486,000.00, in a situation where the JVSA had not been terminated and on the assumption the parties would still be working together as shareholders in Hospital Penawar. To our mind, this outcome appeared unsatisfactory from a commercial perspective as well as on the law. An immediate question that comes to mind in this scenario is this: Since the respondents have "elected" not to terminate the JVSA, and at the same time would receive their proportionate entitlements to profits over 16 years, would they be in the same breath be entitled to receive yearly dividends, or on whatever periodic basis, as may be decided by the company? Would the outcome of the High Court decision not be allowing the respondents to gain disproportionately and in advance of the profits for the alleged breach by the appellant of the JVSA? After all, if the articles of association are strictly followed, there can be no immediate entitlement to profits unless dividends are recommended by the directors and declared by the company. We refer here to arts 108 to 115 of Hospital Penawar's Articles of Association. These are provisions which will be found in most companies limited by shares. We quote below some of the relevant articles under the heading "Dividends and Reserves":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It is trite that articles of association constitute a contractual nexus between shareholders <i>inter se</i>, and between the shareholders and the company, and thus in law, the present parties must be held bound by the articles, unless there are separate, clear provisions in any shareholders agreement between them. The JVSA contains no express provision qualifying or derogating from the normal rules of the company, as expressed in the articles of association, that dividends have to be declared out of profits as recommended by the directors with the proviso that the directors may set aside sums that they might think proper as reserves to be properly applied in the business of the company or for investment from time to time as they might think fit. The effect of the High Court judgment nullified these rules, and the overriding principle of law underpinning these rules that shareholders "have no interest, legal or beneficial over the property" of the company, as expressed in <i>Perman Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, and <i>Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd &amp; Others (supra)</i>, which were the authorities cited before us, and with which we agreed. As stated in <i>Perman Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, this is "a principle which lies at the heart of company law ... that a company is a separate legal person from its shareholders". Profits are assets of the company and it was, with respect, erroneous for the High Court to have ignored this fundamental principle of company law. In this respect, it was timely of counsel for the appellant to have reminded us that on record, and based on the audited accounts, the total dividends declared by Hospital Penawar between the years 2008 and 2011 came only to an average of RM1,120,308.00 per year for the four years. These are actual audited figures. With respect, we found it difficult to accept that the respondents could then recover projected profits even on the lower scale of RM70,486,000.00 for 16 years, even accepting the assumptions and estimates in the HRMH Report could be accepted as valid. The figures simply did not add up. We had no issue, however, to accept SP-4 as an "expert" within the definition of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;45.;;">s 45 of the Evidence Act</LINK>, despite submission to the contrary by the appellant. Nevertheless, it was incumbent on the High Court to have conducted a critical analysis of the HRMH Report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We assessed that report in some detail and considered the answers given by SP-4 in his testimony. Nevertheless, all said, this was a report based on assumptions, estimates and projections that had not been independently verified, despite the explanation given by SP4 in his testimony. Being based on estimated losses and projections, the sums claimed as loss of profits could not be classified as "special damages" for the short reason that they had not been actually incurred, nor capable of exact calculation. We agreed with the appellant's contention in this regard, that the respondents' claim was fundamentally flawed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> On the issue of fiduciary relationship and breach thereof, the law has been clarified in <i>Newacres (supra)</i>, and we accepted the general proposition that in a joint venture, the joint venturers stood in a fiduciary relationship, but a distinction must be drawn between accepting the existence of a fiduciary relationship and determining the proper scope of that relationship on the precise facts and circumstances of each case. The law on fiduciary relationship in a joint venture is fact-sensitive. Even in <i>Newacres (supra)</i>, the proposition of law was qualified. More recently, the English Court of Appeal has again recognised the fact-sensitive nature of such a relationship in <i>Ross River Limited &amp; Blue River Limited Partneship v. Waveley Commerical Limited &amp; Ors</i> [2013] EWCA Civ 910, where the Court of Appeal (per Lord Justice Lloyd) described the issue in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The English Court of Appeal referred to two earlier decisions in <i>Murad v. Al-Saraj</i> [2004] EWHC 1235 and <i>Crossco No 4 Unlimited v. Jolan Ltd</i> [2011] EWCA Civ 1619, stating:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The High Court, in our view, placed too high an emphasis on fiduciary duties being a <i>sine qua non</i> of a joint venture, and in so doing had not properly considered the jointventure on the facts of this appeal being essentially a commercial jointventure, where elements of partnership between the parties were expressly excluded by agreement. It therefore became a matter of construction of the commercial contract between the parties to ascertain the scope of the fiduciary duties owed by the appellant to the respondents. The JVSA speaks of parties using their "best endeavours to ensure that this agreement shall operate as between themselves fairly and equitably". In the total scheme of the JVSA, we did not believe there could be an iron-clad prohibition restricting the appellant from setting up the New Hospital within the area in the absence of a "non-competition" clause. Had that been the intention of the parties, such a clause could have been easily included in the JVSA. In the context of this appeal, the scope of fiduciary duties could not be extended to the extent of rewriting the contract between the parties in the respondents' favour, and it must be borne in mind, the respondents are majority shareholders and in control of management. In such a situation, it is best for the commercial conflicts between the parties to be resolved through the mechanisms provided in the JVSA itself, and not supplant these contractual provisions by equitable doctrines. The proper function is to uphold the bargain of the parties as expressed in the written agreement between them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> As far as the argument relating's to the respondents not being "proper parties" based on the <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> doctrine, we did not believe this was the right approach to adopt. On the facts, and bearing in mind the joint venture relationship, if a breach could be substantiated, obviously the respondents as joint venturers would stand to lose their expected share of the profits through dividends payments. The alleged injury arising from the competition from the New Hospital would affect both the company as well as the joint venturers/ shareholders. As a matter of procedure, we did not believe this argument by the appellant had merit. By the same token, the decision in <i>Pioneer Haven (supra)</i>, was not immediately relevant for this appeal. We allowed the appeal on the other grounds discussed earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As for the technical points raised by the respondents on the issues on the "proper party", the flaw in claiming for expected loss of profits instead of dividends, and the failure of the respondents to terminate the JVSA prior to claiming for damages for expected loss of profits (all of which were either not pleaded in the defence, or raised during trial), and the exact fiduciary relationship between the parties, we did not believe these had merit in the circumstances of this appeal. These grounds were essentially issues of law that did not require the adduction of additional evidence beyond what had already been received during trial. We therefore agreed with the appellant's argument that these were fundamental issues of law on admitted facts that were not in controversy. It was within this court's discretion to allow the submissions in the interest of justice bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of the case (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_496;"><i>Luggage Distributors (M) Sdn Bhd v. Tan Hor Teng &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 496</LINK>; [1995] 1 MLJ 719; [1995] 3 CLJ 520; [1995] 2 AMR 969).</p>
    <p>We noted that as far as the issues pertaining to the fiduciary relationship were concerned, they were in fact raised in the High Court since submissions were requested by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>H. Conclusion And Orders</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In conclusion, the appeal was allowed with costs based on the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the premises, we unanimously allowed the appeal and set aside the orders of the High Court. We awarded costs of RM200,000.00 here and below to the appellant. The deposit was ordered to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
