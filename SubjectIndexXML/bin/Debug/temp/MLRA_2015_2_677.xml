    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>Pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") of a piece of land, the purchaser paid 10% of the purchase price to the vendor. The purchaser then failed to pay the balance purchase price to the vendor within the time frame stipulated in the SPA. However, the purchaser then sued the vendor and obtained from the High Court an order for specific performance compelling the vendor <i>inter alia</i>, to deliver vacant possession of the land. There was no mention in the court order relating to the balance purchase price. The vendor thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Without payment of the balance purchase price and/or securing the balance purchase price for the benefit of the vendor in the order for specific performance, the order would be bad in law. The principle was one relating to common sense and well entrenched under the Specific Relief Act 1950 and related case laws. The trial judge failed to apply the common sense principle as advocated by the Privy Council in <i>Keng Soon Finance Bhd v. MK Retnam Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> relating to the purchase of property and this was reflected on the face of the judgment. (para 2)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The High Court judgment did not demonstrate jurisprudence relating to specific performance at all and was thus perverse. The judgment did not pass the acid test of reasonableness and ought to be set aside. The case was remitted to the High Court to be heard before another judge afresh. (para 7)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's/defendant's appeal was against the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner allowing an order for specific performance by a purported purchaser who had only paid 10% of the purchase price and has not paid the balance purchase price at all and who was granted specific performance with no mention in the order relating to balance purchase price came up for hearing on 12 May 2014. Upon hearing, we set aside the order and directed the matter to be heard before another judge for proper determination of issues, and thanked the learned counsel for their able submission. My learned brothers Abdul Wahab Patail JCA and Linton Albert JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It is trite without payment of balance purchase price and/or securing the balance purchase price for the benefit of the vendor in the order for specific performance will be bad in law. The principle is one relating to common sense and well entrenched under the Specific Relief Act 1950 and related case laws. The learned Judicial Commissioner has failed to apply the common sense principle as advocated by the Privy Council in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_53;"><i>Keng Soon Finance Bhd v. MK Retnam Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 53</LINK>; [1989] 1 MLJ 457; [1989] 1 CLJ 1 relating to purchase of property and this is reflected on the face of the judgment and in our considered view, upon the complaint by the learned counsel for the appellant on a issue of law, we had no option but to set aside the order and direct that the plaintiffs' action be heard before another judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The case has chequered history. In essence, the plaintiffs' claim arises via sales and purchase agreement entered into on 23 May 1996. Only 10% was paid by the purchaser to the vendor. Another RM20,000.00 was agreed to be paid to the vendor to vacate the squatters. The vendor did not ask for the RM20,000.00 neither the purchaser paid the balance purchase price to the vendor within 90 days time frame in the sale and purchase agreement. Without payment of balance purchase price and/or seeking assistance of the court from the year 1996 for whatever breach the purchaser complains of against the vendor, the purported purchaser (plaintiff) claimed for specific performance with no mention in the prayer in the statement of claim for the payment of balance purchase price. The prayer in para 19 of the statement of claim reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner's conclusion in the judgment reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It must be noted that prayers (c) and (d) which is mandatory in nature, relating to squatters and/or vacant possession is not one which can ordinarily be done within the stipulated time frame and will stand as an irrational order on the facts of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The facts of the case is well articulated by the learned Judicial Commissioner and much judicial time will be saved if it is repeated to appreciate the factual matrix of the case. The brief facts read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We have perused the 16 page judgment, in great detail. To the credit of the learned Judicial Commissioner it is well drafted in English and a speaking judgment save that the judgment does not demonstrate jurisprudence relating to specific performance at all, and the judgment is perverse. The judgment in our view did not pass the acid test of reasonableness. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_867;"><i>Damusa Sdn Bhd v. MRCB Prasarana Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] MLRHU 867</LINK>]. In consequence, the judgment dated 19 September 2011 is set aside and the case is remitted to the High Court to be heard before another judge afresh and the respondent to pay costs of RM10,000.00 to the appellant and the deposit to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We hereby ordered so.</p>
