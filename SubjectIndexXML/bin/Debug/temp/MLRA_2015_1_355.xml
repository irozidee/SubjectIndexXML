      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>On 11 August 2011, the appellant applied for an <i>ex parte</i> application for leave to file an application for judicial review against the decision of the State Authority to acquire its two pieces of adjoining lands, and for an extension of time to file the application in the event the application was filed out of the 40-day time period under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC 1980')</LINK>. At the hearing, Senior Federal Counsel raised a preliminary objection, namely, that the appellant's application was filed out of the 40-day time period since time began to run from the gazette publication date of the Intended Acquisition in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form D Land Acquisition Act 1960 ('LAA')</LINK> on 9 June 2011. Thus, the appellant's application on 11 August 2011 was filed out of time. The High Court and subsequently the Court of Appeal upheld the objection, which led to this appeal before the Federal Court. The question before the court was whether the 40-day time period under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) RHC 1980</LINK> was to be computed from the gazette publication date of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form D LAA</LINK> or the service of the notice of inquiry in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form E LAA</LINK> on the registered proprietor of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(1) LAA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, unanimously allowing the appeal</p>
    <p>Per Ramly Ali FCJ (Richard Malanjum CJSS, Mohamed Apandi Ali, Abu Samah Nordin FCJJ concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The actual commencement of proceedings for land acquisition was the giving of public notice in Form E under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10 LAA</LINK> by causing copies of such notification, declaration or document to be posted at the District Land Office, on public notice boards in the township in which the land was situated and in such other places on or near the land in question as the Land Administrator might think fit. There was no indication in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA that Form E</LINK> must be published in the gazette. However, as required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(3) LAA</LINK>, a copy of the schedule to the declaration in Form D gazetted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(2) LAA</LINK> must be appended to every notice in Form E. (paras 41-42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">Section 11 LAA</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">ss 53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 LAA</LINK> clearly intended that Form E, the relevant document to commence proceedings for land acquisition under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>, must effectively be delivered and communicated to the interested persons, particularly the occupier or the registered proprietor of such land. The clear effect of those provisions was that the relevant notice and information relating to the acquisition must be brought to the actual knowledge of the persons concerned, and sufficient proof acknowledging the service of the documents by the person to whom such documents were delivered must be obtained and entered in an official book to be kept for that purpose. (para 47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> With the comprehensive and elaborate provisions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 LAA</LINK>, it could be safely concluded that a mere publication in the gazette of a notification or declaration in Form D under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) LAA</LINK> was clearly insufficient for the purpose of communicating the decision relating to the land acquisition to the interested persons concerned. For the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) RHC 1980</LINK>, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form E LAA</LINK> could be construed as the first communication to the appellant of the decision by the State Authority to acquire its lands in question. As the appellant received Form E on 11 July 2011 and filed its judicial review application on 11 August 2011, the application was well within the 40-day time period for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) RHC 1980</LINK>. (paras 48-49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The Court of Appeal appeared to give two interpretations in its judgment as to when the decision to be challenged was first communicated to the appellant, namely, that it was at the date of the gazette publication of Form D and that it "can also occur" at the date Form E was served on the appellant. Where a statute was susceptible to two or more interpretations, the interpretation reflecting the will and intention of the legislation should be accepted. The will and intention of the legislature in relation to land acquisition proceedings under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> was that the decision to acquire land must effectively be communicated or brought to the actual knowledge or attention of the interested persons concerned in the manner specifically provided for in the relevant sections. The words of the relevant sections spoke of the intention of the legislature, and the court could not restrict the meaning and ignore the clear terms of the provisions of the law. (paras 51-52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Both the High Court and Court of Appeal relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18(2) Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> to find that the gazette publication of Form D under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8 LAA</LINK> constituted sufficient notice in law to the appellant and the date of such publication could be regarded as the date when the decision in question was first communicated to the appellant. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;18.;;">Section 18</LINK> was a general provision applicable to interpretation of all relevant written laws. However, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 LAA</LINK> were specific provisions to impress that the notification in Form E must mandatorily be served or communicated to the interested persons who were likely to be affected by the land acquisition in the manner prescribed thereunder. The relevant specific sections established that the notification or declaration of the land acquisition in question was only "first communicated" to the appellant when the appellant received Form E on 11 July 2011. (paras 53-55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The rights of a citizen to property under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 Federal Constitution</LINK> could only be deprived in accordance with law and an actual notice (as opposed to a constructive notice by way of a gazette) of such deprivation ought to be given to the owner as prescribed in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>. The appellant could not be expected to apply for leave to commence judicial review to challenge the deprivation of its rights to the property unless it had knowledge or was made aware of such deprivation. That could only happen when the appellant was served with the actual or express notice that its right was infringed. The first written notice required to be issued and served on the appellant as registered proprietor of the land under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> was Form E issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(1) LAA</LINK>. Further, local case authorities establish that in applying <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) RHC 1980</LINK>, time would only start to run against an applicant for judicial review when the applicant had actual knowledge of the relevant decision or that the applicant was served with the relevant notices in accordance with the relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>. (paras 61-62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> An application for leave for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) RHC 1980</LINK> challenging the decision of the State Authority declaring that the land was to be acquired under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> must be filed within 40 days from the date when the decision was first communicated to the applicant, ie from the date when the notice of enquiry in Form E which appended a copy of the schedule to the declaration in Form D (as required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(3) LAA</LINK>) was issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10</LINK> and served on the registered proprietor or occupier of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">ss 11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 LAA</LINK>. Form E in the present appeal dated 3 July 2011 was served through registered mail to the appellant on 11 July 2011. The appellant filed the leave application on 11 August 2011, ie 32 days from the date when Form E was first served on the appellant. That was clearly within the stipulated period of 40 days under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) RHC 1980</LINK>. Therefore, the filing of the leave application was within time. That being the case, the question of extension of time to file the leave application did not arise. (paras 68-69)</p>
    <p>Per Zaleha Zahari FCJ:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The filing of an application for leave to apply for judicial review for an order of <i>certiorari</i> must be filed within 40 days of publication of Form D in the gazette and not from the date of service of Form E. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8</LINK> was clearly the operative provision with regard to the notification of the State Authority's decision to acquire land for a public purpose. If the law fixed the public with knowledge, and deemed such knowledge to be a fact, a court must necessarily give effect to it. Clearly in respect of lands to be acquired for a public purpose the notification of such an intention of the State Authority by way of a publication in the gazette was the most practical and sensible way in which to give notice of such an intention. The publication of Form D in the gazette was a public notice to all persons, such as the appellant, the registered proprietor of lands subjected to the acquisition. (paras 109-110)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The declaration of the intended acquisition in Form D in this case was gazetted on 9 June 2011. The application for judicial review was filed on 11 August 2011. The Court of Appeal was correct in ruling that the 40-day time period prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) RHC 1980</LINK> commenced from 9 June 2011 and that there was delay in filing the application for leave. An application for leave to apply for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> must be filed within 40 days from the date of the publication of Form D in the gazette and not from the service of the notice of enquiry in Form E on the registered proprietor. Notwithstanding that, the facts and circumstances warranted an exercise of the court's discretion to extend time in the appellant's favour. The State Authority's omission to reply to the appellant's letter of 30 January 2011 containing the proposal that the appellant be allowed to continue with the development of the lands should have been taken into consideration. That failure by the State Authority to respond warranted the exercise of the court's power to extend time. The fact that the appellant attended the inquiry before the Land Administrator should not be held against it. The appellant had in fact applied for an extension of time. There was sufficient material before the court to extend time. The application for extension should have been allowed. (paras 112-115)</p>

    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant in the present appeal before us, was the applicant in the High Court who had filed an <i>ex parte</i> application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings to quash the decision of the State Authority in having compulsorily acquired two parcels of land belonging to the appellant. In the same application the appellant had also sought two further orders, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The High Court dismissed the said <i>ex parte</i> application with costs on 27 December 2011. Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. On 30 May 2012, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal with costs and affirmed the decision of the High Court. The appellant is now appealing against the said decision of the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 27 November 2012, leave to appeal was granted by this court to the appellant on the following questions of law, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Factual Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At all material times, the appellant was the registered proprietor of Lot 150 GRN 3605 and Lot 151, GRN 3606, Seksyen 18, Bandar Alor Setar, Kedah. The two lots were adjacent to each other. The appellant had obtained planning permission from the Majlis Perbandaran Kota Setar vide its letter dated 12 December 1993 for the construction of a building known as Plaza Tunku Yaacob on Lot 150 and that the building had been partially constructed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> By a letter dated 5 January 2011 from the 3rd respondent, the appellant was informed that the 2nd respondent was planning to re-develop the said Plaza Tunku Yaakob and that the 3rd respondent together with another 3rd party, known as Bellview Group were entrusted to jointly plan the proposed re-development of the plaza estimated to cost RM300 million; and that the appellant was invited to be involved in the said re-development and was invited to attend a meeting at the 3rd respondent's office on 18 January 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant's representatives attended the said meeting. In that meeting, the 3rd respondent presented two options for the re-development of the plaza, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> At the said meeting, the appellant's representatives were only shown some drawings of the proposed facade for the re-development of the plaza. The 3rd respondent did not furnish the appellant with any document or information relating to the planning details, costing, sales forecast and time table, etc to enable the appellant to reach a considered decision whether to participate in the joint venture or not.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Vide a letter dated 30 January 2011, the appellant wrote to the 3rd respondent proposing a third alternative, ie that the appellant be allowed to complete the construction of the said plaza. In that same letter the appellant had also indicated that it was however prepared to revisit the 2nd option in the event its alternative option is not agreeable by the 3rd respondent. There was no reply to this letter and neither did the 3rd respondent contact the appellant again on the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In the meantime, the appellant received through a registered mail on 11 July 2011, a <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form E of the LAA</LINK> dated 3 July 2011, giving notice that in accordance with a declaration of intended acquisition of the two lots, an inquiry to hear all claims for compensation for all interest in the said lands would be held on 25 July 2011. The inquiry was subsequently postponed to 17 August 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant alleged that before receiving the said Form E, it was not aware that a decision had been made by the State Authority to acquire the said lands and a declaration in Form D had been made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8 of the LAA</LINK>. According to the respondent the notification in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form D of the LAA</LINK> was issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the same Act</LINK> on 20 April 2011 and subsequently gazetted on 9 June 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 11 August 2011, the appellant filed an <i>ex parte</i> application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings at the High Court, seeking <i>inter alia</i> the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> At the hearing of the leave application a preliminary objection was raised by the Attorney General's Chambers that the appellant's application was not made within the time prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> because the 40 days period mentioned in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">r 3(6)</LINK> commenced to run from the date of publication of Form D in the gazette on 9 June 2011, thus the appellant's application which was filed on 11 August 2011 was 23 days out of time; and therefore the appellant's application for leave must be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant on the other hand contended that the 40 days period for filing the leave application as prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> would only start to run against the appellant when it received Form E issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10 of the LAA</LINK>, via registered mail on 11 July 2011; and the 40 days period ended on or about 20 August 2011; therefore, the leave application which was filed on 11 August 2011 was clearly within the 40 days period as prescribed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 27 December 2011 the High Court dismissed the appellant's application for leave on the said preliminary objection raised by the Attorney General's Chambers. The learned judge held that the date of publication in the gazette of Form D on 9 June 2011 was the date on which the decision to acquire the lands was first communicated to the appellant, as the registered proprietor of the lands. The learned judge also held that the appellant's application for leave which was filed on 11 August 2011 was 23 days out of time; and the appellant had not given any reasons for the late filing of the said application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed with costs on 14 January 2013. Briefly, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The issue before us revolves on the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> in the context of land acquisition proceedings under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> At the relevant time when the leave application was filed by the appellant on 11 August 2011, the applicable provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) was under the old RHC 1980</LINK>, which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The same provisions were adopted in the Rules of Court 2012 that came into effect on 1 August 2012, except that the time to apply for judicial review was extended from 40 days to three months.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The issue before us is: when does the 40 days period under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> start to run? - is it at the date of publication of Form D in the gazette under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the LAA</LINK> or the date of service of the notice of enquiry in Form E on the registered proprietor of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(1) of the LAA</LINK>?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>, an application for judicial review, must be made promptly and in any event within 40 days from the date when the grounds for the application first arose or when the decision was first communicated to the applicant. However, the High Court may for a good reason extend the said period of 40 days.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The appellant argued that the rights of the appellant as a citizen to property under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> could only be deprived in accordance with law and that it would only be fair and reasonable that the decision to acquire its lands be brought to its actual knowledge by way of communicating the same to the appellant. The appellant further submitted that a citizen cannot be expected to apply for leave to commence judicial review to challenge the decision to acquire his property unless he was made aware of such a decision, and this could only happen when he received actual notice (as opposed to a constructive notice by way of a gazette) of the said decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The Attorney General's Chambers submitted that an application for leave for judicial review made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the RHC 1980</LINK> must be filed within 40 days from the date of the publication of Form D in the Gazette under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the LAA</LINK>; and not from the service of the notice of enquiry in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form E of the LAA</LINK> on the registered proprietor of the land in question. The Chambers further submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8 of the LAA</LINK> is the operative provision with regard to the notification of the decision to acquire for a public purpose and the publication in the gazette is a public notice to all persons including the appellant who is the registered proprietor of the land in question; and in the present case, the intended acquisition in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form D of the LAA</LINK> was gazette on 9 June 2011, and the application for leave for judicial review was filed by the appellant on 11 August 2011; and therefore, there was a delay of 23 days in filling the said application and there was no explanation offered by the appellant in its affidavits to explain the delay to support its application for an extension of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The Attorney General's Chambers also submitted that the publication of Form D in the gazette not only constitutes sufficient notice in law to the appellant of the decision to acquire the lands which is a matter required to be published in the gazette by a federal law, such publication can be regarded as the date when the decision to acquire the lands was first communicated to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the present application for judicial review, the decision being challenged is the State Authority's acquisition of the appellant's lands and the conduct of the land acquisition proceedings as reflected in Form E issued to the appellant. It is crucial to first identify definitely what is the decision that is being challenged. The question that arose pertaining to whether the application by the appellant was out of time <i>vis-a-vis</i> the said decision was first communicated to the appellant. This would determine when the prescribed 40 days period for filing the application for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> should begin to run.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The word "communicate" is not expressly defined in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;;">RHC 1980</LINK>. It is also not expressly defined in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>. In the <i>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i> the verb "communicate" is given the meaning of "convey or exchange information, etc succeed in invoking understanding" . The <i>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</i> defines "communicate" as "to make something known to somebody"; "to pass something on; to transmit something" ; "to make one's idea, feelings, etc clear to others". In the <i>Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners</i> (new edn), the word "communicate" is explained as "to express thoughts, feelings, or information to another person ... for example by speaking or writing"; "to let someone knew what you are feeling or thinking." It is further explained as "when people communicate; it is as if their thoughts and ideas travel between one person and the other; or are sent from one person to another."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the case of <i>Sh Gurbachan Singh v. SM Jagiro</i> [1956] AIR Vol 43, Punjab Section, p 254, Bhandari CJ, ruled that the expression "communicate" is not synonymous with the expression "publish" which mean "to make public". It means "to bestow convey make known, recount, to import as to communicate information to anyone".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In that case, the validity of an order of a second class Magistrate dated 22 January 1955 (made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;488.;;">s 488 of the CPC</LINK>) was challenged on the ground that the learned Magistrate did not exercise the powers of a Magistrate of the first class on 22 January 1955 as a copy of the notification by which the Magistrate was invested with the powers of a Magistrate of the first class, though dated 3 January 1955, was only sent to him on 8 February 1955 and published in the local official gazette on 18 February 1955. The relevant rule, (ie <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;39.;;">s 39(2) of the CPC</LINK>) declared that an order conferring magisterial powers on a person "shall take effect on the day on which it is communicated to the person concerned".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The court held that as the order investing the Magistrate with powers of the first class Magistrate was not communicated to him till 8 February 1955 and as he did not exercise the powers of the first class Magistrate before that date, it was not within his competence to make an order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;488.;;">s 488 of the CPC</LINK> on 22 January 1955; the order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;488.;;">s 488</LINK> was therefore void and set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The clear indication in the above case is that "the day on which it is communicated to the person concerned" as stipulated in the relevant <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;39.;;">s 39(2) of the CPC</LINK>, refers to the day when a copy of the notification was actually sent and bought to the actual notice of the Magistrate concerned on 8 February 1955, and not the day when the said notification was issued on 3 January 1955, nor the day when it was published in the official gazette on 18 February 1955.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The above decision is clearly in line with the literal meaning of the word "communicate" as defined in the various dictionaries cited above. On the presumption that the legislature does nothing in vain, the court must endeavour to give significance to every word of the law legislated and it is presumed that if a word or phrase appears in a legislation, it was put there for a purpose and must not be disregarded. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_52;"><i>Foo Loke Ying &amp; Anor v. Television Broadcasts Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 52</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 35; [1985] CLJ 122, <i>Quebec Railway, Light, Heat and Power Co Ltd v. Vandry</i> [1920] AC 662 and <i>Enmore Estates Ltd v. Darsan</i> [1970] AC 497, 506).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Abdoolcader SCJ in <i>Foo Loke Ying (supra)</i> had made a very interesting observation on this issue when His Lordship said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Where the language of a legislation is clear and explicit, the court must give effect to it, whatever may be the consequence, for in that case, the words of the legislation speak of the intention of the legislature. If the precise words used are plain and unambiguous, the court is bound to construe them in their ordinary sense, and not to limit those plain words by other considerations (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_4_74;"><i>Ex P Guan Teik Sdn Bhd (Substituting Lim Oo Guan, Deceased)</i> [2009] 4 MLRA 74</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 1; [2010] 4 CLJ 289).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In the above case (<i>Ex P Guan Teik</i>), Augustine Paul FCJ expressed his view that where the words used are ambiguous, the meaning to be preferred must be one which is more in accord with justice and convenience but in general the words used read in their context must prevail. His Lordship cited a passage from <i>Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes</i> (7th edn) at p 554 to affirm that "it may therefore, be well settled that when, a statute is susceptible of two or more interpretations, normally that interpretation should be accepted as reflecting the will of the Legislature which is presumed to operate most equitably, justly and reasonably as judged by the ordinary and normal conceptions of what is right and what is wrong and of what is just and what is unjust."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In order to determine the issue before us in the present appeal, the words "the date when the decision is first communicated to the applicant" as found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> must be read together or in the context of the relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> relating to land acquisition proceedings. All those relevant provisions must be interpreted based on "a purposive and literal construction which is one which follows the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose and applies where the literal meaning is clear and reflects the purposes of the enactment." This is clearly in line with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 (Act 338)</LINK> which provides that "in the interpretation of a provision of an Act a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is express by stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It is perhaps necessary to refer to some relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> and the relevant forms issued relating to land acquisition proceedings under the said Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Whenever the State Authority is satisfied that any land in the locality in the State is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for any purpose which is beneficial to the economic development of Malaysia or to the public generally, a notification in Form A shall be published in the gazette. Form A is just a notice that the land in question is likely to be acquired. As part of a preliminary investigation, the Land Administrator shall give public notice of the notification by causing copies of such notification to be posted at the District Land Office, on public notice boards in the township or mukim in which the land to which such notification refers, is situated or in such other places on or near the land specified by the Land Administrator, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">s 52 of the LAA</LINK>. This is provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;4.;;">s 4 of the Act</LINK>. Under subsection (3), the said notification shall lapse in so far as it relates to any land in respect of which there is not published in the Gazette within 12 months from the date of publication of such notification, a declaration of intended acquisition as in Form D under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the same Act</LINK>. There is no express provision in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> that this notification in Form A must be served on the occupier or registered proprietor of the land in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> After the issuance of Form A, the Land Administrator shall under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;7.;;">s 7 of the LAA</LINK> prepares and submits to the State Authority a plan of the whole area of such lands which would be necessary to acquire and a list of such lands affected by acquisition, in Form C. There is also no requirement under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA that Form C</LINK> needs to be published in the gazette, or to be served on anybody.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The next step is the issuance of a declaration of intended acquisition in Form D by the State Authority under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8 of the LAA</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Form D is a declaration of an intended acquisition of lands required for public purpose. The list of lands referred to in Form C must be included as a schedule to Form D. The declaration shall lapse and ceases to be of any effect on the expiry of two years after the date of its publication in the gazette in so far as it relates to any land in respect of which the Land Administrator has not made an award in respect of each person whose interest in the land has been established in an enquiry under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14 of the LAA</LINK>. Where the declaration has lapsed, all proceedings already taken or being taken in consequence of such declaration in respect of such lands shall terminate and be of no effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Form D needs to be published in the gazette as required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK>. There is no requirement that it must be served in anybody (otherwise than by notification in the gazette).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The actual commencement of proceedings for land acquisition is by giving public notice in Form E under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10 of the LAA</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">Section 10</LINK> provides:</p>

      <b>[45]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">Section 53</LINK> stresses on strict compliance of service of notices or other documents relating to land acquisition upon the occupier or registered proprietor as well as person having a registered interest in such land. Those notices or documents, duly signed by the Land Administrator must be delivered or tendered a copy thereof to the person to whom the notice is addressed or, if he cannot be found, to any adult member of his family residing with him. The signature of the person to whom such copy is delivered or tendered must be obtained and endorsed upon the original documents or an office copy thereof; and such endorsement must be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose.</p>

      <b>[46]</b> In the event that service of the notice or document cannot be done effectively under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">s 53</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">s 54 of the LAA</LINK> provides that the Land Administrator must proceed to effect service upon an agent authorised to receive service on behalf of the party or upon a person entitled to act for such party, or where there is no such agent or person entitled to act within the state, effect service by sending the notice by registered post to the party if after reasonable inquiry, his address can be ascertained, and where he considers that publication in a newspaper is desirable, publish the notice in such local newspaper circulating in the State as he thinks fit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The clear intention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">s 11</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">ss 53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">s 54 of the LAA</LINK> is that Form E, the relevant document to commence proceedings for land acquisition under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> must effectively be delivered and communicated to the interested persons, particularly the occupier or the registered proprietor of such land. The clear effect of those provisions is that the relevant notice and information relating to the acquisition must be brought to the actual knowledge of the persons concerned; and sufficient proof acknowledging the service of the documents by the person to whom such documents are delivered must be obtained and entered in an official book to be kept for that purpose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> With the comprehensive and elaborate provisions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 of the LAA</LINK>, we can safely conclude that a mere publication in the gazette of a notification or declaration in Form D under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the LAA</LINK> is clearly insufficient for the purpose of communicating the decision relating to the lands acquisition to the interested persons concerned. Our view is that for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Form E of the LAA</LINK> which commences proceedings for the acquisition of lands and served on the interested persons in the manner prescribed by the relevant express specific provisions in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>, can be construed as the first communication to the appellant, being the registered proprietor of the lands in question, of the decision by the State Authority to acquire its lands in question. To borrow the words of Bhandari CJ in the case of <i>Sh Gurbachan Singh v. SM Jagiro (supra)</i>, the expression "communicate" is not synonymous with the expression "publish" which mean "to make public".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In the present case, the relevant Form E was issued on 3 July 2011 by the State Authority. It was posted by registered mail and was received by the appellant on 11 July 2011. On 11 August 2011 the appellant filed the leave application for judicial review at the High Court in Alor Setar, Kedah. Taking the date 11 July 2011 as the starting point, it is clear that the leave application which was filed on 11 August 2011, was well within the 40 days period for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of RHC 1980</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In affirming the decision of the High Court, the Court of Appeal held that based on the wordings of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6), of the RHC 1980</LINK>, a first communication of a decision to acquire the lands in question to the appellant under the rule "can also occur when the decision is published in the gazette." The Court of Appeal in its judgment used the words "can also occur" (at p 8, para 19 of the judgment). Conversely, the impression it gives is that the communication can also occur when Form E was issued and served on the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> From our reading of the Court of Appeal's judgment, it appears that there could be two interpretations as to when the decision to be challenged was first communicated to the appellant, ie the date of publication of Form D in the gazette and it "can also occur" at the date when Form E was served on the appellant. The settled general rule is that "when a statute is susceptible of two or more interpretations, normally that interpretation should be accepted as reflecting the will of the legislation which is presumed to operate most equitably, justly and reasonably as judged by the ordinary and normal conceptions of what is right and what is wrong and of what is just and what is unjust." This principle is clearly stated in <i>Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes</i> (7th edn) at p 554; which was accepted by the Federal Court in <i>Ex P Guan Teik Sdn Bhd (Substituting Lim Oo Guan, Deceased) (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> In the present case, as we have demonstrated above that the will and intention of the legislature in relation to land acquisition proceedings under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> is that the decision to acquire land must effectively be communicated or brought to the actual knowledge or attention of the interested persons concerned in the manner specifically provided for in the relevant sections. The words of the relevant sections speak of the intention of the legislature, and the court cannot restrict the meaning and ignore the clear terms of the provisions of the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Both the High Court as well as the Court of Appeal relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> in arriving at their decisions that the publication of Form D notification in the gazette under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8 of the LAA</LINK> constitutes sufficient notice in law to the appellant and the date of such publication can be regarded as the date when the decision in question was first communicated to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">Section 18(2) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Our view is that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> is a general provision applicable to interpretation of all relevant written laws. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18(2) of the said Act</LINK>, publication in the official gazette shall constitute sufficient notice of any matter required to be published in the gazette by or under any federal law; whereas <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 of the LAA</LINK> are specific provisions specifically to impress that the notification in Form E thereunder must mandatorily be served or communicated to the interested persons who are likely to be affected by the land acquisition in question, in the manner prescribed thereunder. The words "constitute sufficient notice of any matter required to be published in the gazette by or under any federal law ..." cannot override the effect of those relevant specific sections in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>. It cannot be construed that by the publication in the gazette, the State Authority had "communicated" the said notification or declaration to the appellant for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. Giving effect to the relevant specific sections in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>, as discussed above, the said notification or declaration was only "first communicated" to the appellant when Form E was served on it on 11 July 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> It is a well-known rule of construction that specific provisions overrides general provisions. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_222;"><i>Lee Lian &amp; Ors v.

    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The relevant specific provisions in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK> must be given effect in interpreting the issue of service or communication of the notification or declaration to the interested persons in matters relating to land acquisition in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>.

    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Learned Senior Federal Counsel, for the Attorney General's Chambers cited the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_73;"><i>Abdul Aziz Mohd Alias v. Timbalan Ketua Polis Negara, Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 73</LINK>; [2009] 1 MLJ 137; [2010] 3 CLJ 643 to support her argument that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8 of the LAA</LINK> is the operative provision with regard to the notification of the decision of the State Authority to acquire land for a public purpose and the publication in the gazette is a public notice to all persons including the appellant who was the registered proprietor of the lands in question. Her conclusion is that the 40 days time frame for the purpose of a judicial review application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> should run from the date of the gazette notification of Form D on 9 June 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Our view is that the issue in that case can be distinguished from the issue before us in the present appeal and therefore the ruling may not be applicable in the present case. In that case, the Federal Court ruled that "<LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1993_395;;">the 1993 Regulations (the Public Officers (Conduct and Discipline) Regulations 1993)</LINK> is a federal law and duly gazetted under PU(A) 395. As it is a law duly gazetted, the public are deemed to have notice of the same." In other words, the ruling deals with constructive notice based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Interpretation Act 1948 and 1967</LINK>. It deals with the existence of a federal law where the public is deemed to have notice of the law upon their publication in the gazette.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In the present case before us we are interpreting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>, where the key words under consideration are "when the decision is first communicated to the applicant." The wordings of the Order must be read together with the specific mandatory provisions in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>, particularly <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK>, relating to service of notification or declaration on acquisition of land by the State Authority in form E on the registered proprietor, the occupier of such land, or any other interested persons. The clear effect of those provisions is that the relevant notice or declaration relating to the acquisition must be brought to the actual knowledge (as opposed to constructive notice by way of a publication in the gazette) of the persons concerned; only then, the interested persons can exercise their right to challenge the acquisition decision by way of judicial review proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> within the prescribed time period.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> By the acquisition of the lands, the appellant was deprived of its rights to the property. As such it would only be just and fair that the decision to acquire the lands be brought to the appellant's actual knowledge by way of communicating the same to the appellant. The rights of a citizen to property under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> could only be deprived in accordance with law and that an actual notice (as opposed to a constructive notice by way of a gazette) of such deprivation ought to have been given to the owner as prescribed in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>. The appellant cannot be expected to apply for leave to commence judicial review to challenge the deprivation of its rights to the property unless it has knowledge or is made aware of such deprivation and this could only happen when the appellant is served with the actual or express notice that its right has been infringed. The first written notice required to be issued and served on the appellant, as registered proprietor of the said lands, under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA is Form E</LINK> issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(1) of the LAA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> There are a number of authorities locally to support the above findings, ie in applying <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>, the time would only start to run against an applicant for judicial review when the applicant had actual knowledge of the relevant decision or that the applicant had been served with the relevant notices in accordance with relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">the LAA</LINK>.</p>

The learned High Court Judge found that the application was made more than 11 years from the time the first decision was made known to the public, and more than one year from the time it was communicated to the applicant. The learned High Court Judge found that the applicant had actual knowledge of the approval of the EIA Report as of 8 January 2007, a period in excess of one year prior to the filing of the application for leave under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> In the present appeal, Form E dated 3 July 2011 was served through registered mail to the appellant on 11 July 2011. The appellant filed the leave application on 11 August 2011, ie 32 days from the date when it was first served on the appellant. This is clearly within the stipulated period of 40 days under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. Therefore, the filing of the leave application was within time. That being the case the question of extension of time to file the leave application does not arise.</p>

      <b>[70]</b> Accordingly, we allow this appeal with costs and set aside the order of the High Court as well as the order of the Court of Appeal. We also make an order that the leave application for judicial review filed by the appellant be remitted to the High Court for hearing on merit.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The appellant obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court on 27 November 2012 against the decision of the Court of Appeal dated 30 May 2012 on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> The appellant is the owner of two pieces of adjoining lands, namely Lot 150 GRN 3605 and Lot 151 Seksyen 18 GRN 3606, Bandar Alor Setar, Daerah Kota Setar, Kedah (subsequently referred to as Lot 150, Lot 151 respective or jointly as "the said lands"). On 12 December 1993 the appellant obtained approval from the relevant authorities to construct a building to be known as "Plaza Tunku Yaacob Complex" on Lot 150. According to the appellant this building had only been partially constructed due to ongoing litigation which had yet to be resolved.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> The Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Kedah (the 3rd respondent in the High Court as well as in this appeal, subsequently referred to as "PKNK") vide letter dated 5 January 2011 informed the appellant that the Kedah State Government (the 2nd respondent in the High Court and in this appeal subsequently referred to as the "State Authority") together with other named parties, were planning to re-develop the long abandoned Plaza Tunku Yaacob Complex. PKNK together with the Bellview Group were given the responsibility to jointly plan the proposed re-development of Plaza Tunku Yaacob Complex, Lot 151 as well as an adjacent petrol station. The appellant was invited to participate in the proposed re-development of the subject lands and to attend a meeting to be held at the PKNK's office on 18 January 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> Representatives of the appellant duly attended the meeting held on 18 January 2011. At that meeting two options were considered for the re-development of the said lands, ie by way of land acquisition proceedings; alternatively, by way of a joint venture where the appellant would be invited to participate up to 20% to 30% equity. According to the appellant at this meeting no document were presented nor planning details given as to costing, sale forecast, time tables, etc to enable the appellant to make a considered decision whether or not to participate in the proposed joint venture.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> The appellant then, vide letter dated 30 January 2011 to PKNK, submitted a third proposal, ie that the appellant be allowed to complete the development of the Plaza Tunku Yaacob Complex. According to the appellant, there was no reply to this letter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> On 20 April 2011, the Pentadbir Tanah Kedah (the 1st respondent in the High Court as well as in this appeal, subsequently referred to as "the Land Administrator), pursuant to the power conferred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8</LINK>, issued Form D, a Declaration of Intended Acquisition of Lot 150 and Lot 151. The record shows that this Form D was published in the gazette on 9 June 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> The appellant contended that they had no knowledge of the Declaration of Intended Acquisition in terms of the Form D which had been issued and gazetted. The appellant's case was that during this period they were waiting for a response from PKNK to the proposal made vide their letter dated 30 January 2011, for them be allowed to continue to develop Lot 150.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> On 11 July 2011 the appellant received by registered mail a Form E dated 3 July 2011, notifying them that, pursuant to the Form D Declaration of Intended Acquisition of Lots 150 and 151 which had earlier been issued and gazetted, an enquiry would be held on 25 July 2011 to hear all claims to compensation arising from the said acquisition. This hearing was however adjourned to 17 August 2011 for hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> The appellant then, on 11 August 2011, filed an <i>ex parte</i> application for leave to apply for judicial review for the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> In their affidavit filed in support of the application for leave, the appellant contended that the State Authority had failed to take into consideration the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The appellant then applied for the hearing before the Land Administrator to be adjourned pending disposal of the leave application to apply for judicial review, which application was not allowed by the Land Administrator. The appellant contended that they attended the Inquiry held on 17 August 2011 before the Land Administrator without prejudice to their application which they had filed, for leave to file the application for judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> At the hearing of the appellant's <i>ex parte</i> application for leave, the Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) who appeared for the Attorney-General raised a preliminary objection. The SFC contended that the appellant's application was not filed within the time prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>. Counsel for the Land Administrator and State Authority also contended that the 40 days prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> had not been complied with. According to the respondents, time was to be computed from the date of the publication of the Declaration of Intended Acquisition of Form D in the Gazette, (ie 9 June 2011).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> The appellant took issue. The appellant's case was the period of 40 days runs from the date Borang E was received by them by registered post, (ie on 11 July 2011), not the date when Form D was published in the gazette (9 June 2011). The appellant's case was 9 June 2011 was the date when the decision to acquire Lot 150 and Lot 151 was first communicated to the appellant. Thus, when the leave application was filed by the appellant on 11 August 2011, only 32 days had passed, well within the 40 days prescribed by the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> On 27 December 2011 the learned High Court Judge of Alor Setar upheld the preliminary objection raised by the respondents. The appellant's application for leave to apply for judicial review was then dismissed. The learned High Court Judge ruled that time starts to run from the date of publication of Form D (the Notice of Intended Acquisition) in the gazette, ie on 9 June 2011. That the date of publication was the date on which the decision to acquire the said lands was first communicated to the appellant. The learned judge finding was that as the application was filed on 11 August 2011, the appellant was accordingly 23 days out of time. The learned High Court Judge declined to exercise his discretion to extend the prescribed period as the appellant had not given any reason for delay in filing the said leave application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> On appeal, the Court of Appeal on 30 May 2012 dismissed the appellant's appeal and affirmed the decision of the High Court Judge. The unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal was that the learned High Court Judge had properly directed his mind to the issue whether the application was filed within time. The Court of Appeal's reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> was there was nothing to suggest that the first communication must be "received" by the appellant. A communication of the decision to the appellant can also occur when the decision was published in the gazette. The Court of Appeal held that the Form D notification vide publication in the gazette, which decision was required by law to be published in the gazette, constituted sufficient notice to the appellant of the decision to acquire Lots 150 and 151. The date of such a publication can be regarded as the date when the decision to acquire the said lands was "first communicated" to the appellant. On the High Court not exercising his discretion to extend time, the Court of Appeal held that the learned judge had in fact considered the appellant's application to extend time but declined to do so as the appellant had not given any reason for the late filing of the said application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> The appellant's counsel submitted that the Rules Committee would have used the word 'notice' instead of 'first communicated' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> if it was intended that a notice to the public at large is sufficient compared to personal knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> The appellant's counsel submitted there was no necessity to resort to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> in construing <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>. The meaning of the words of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> was clear, time only start to run under the second limb of this rule, when the appellant had actual knowledge of the respondent's decision to acquire the said lands. The appellant had knowledge of the decision to acquire the said lands only when the appellant received Form E (enclosing the Form D) on 11 July 2011. The date when the decision was communicated to the appellant was therefore 11 July 2011. The prescribed 40 days' time thus commenced from 11 July 2011. As the leave application was filed on 11 August 2011, it was accordingly filed well within the prescribed time frame.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> As to the appellant participation in the inquiry before the Land Administrator, the appellant's counsel submitted this should not be held against the appellant as the appellant had made it clear that it was without prejudice to the application for leave which had been earlier filed. The appellant had vide letter dated 15 August 2011 applied for an adjournment of the hearing of the inquiry scheduled on 17 August 2011 pending the outcome of the leave application, which application was not entertained. In such a situation the appellant had no choice but to participate in the inquiry before the Land Administrator. The appellant also highlighted the fact that they had also appealed vide the prescribed Form N, both dated 27 September 2011 against the decision of the Land Administrator. One of the objections raised in the appeal was the fact that an application for leave for <i>certiorari</i> to quash the acquisition of the said lands had been filed. The fact of the appellant having filed the required Form N does not estop the appellant from proceeding with their leave application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> According to the appellant, even if the land acquisition had been completed, this must not be construed as recognition to the legitimacy of the said acquisition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> This court should accordingly compute time to apply for a leave for judicial review to commence from the date the appellant received Form E, or the Form E which appended with a copy of Form D, and to rule that the application for leave to file an application for judicial review was filed within time. The court was then urged to remit the appellant's application for leave back to the High Court for hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The 1st And 2nd Respondents' Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> Counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondent submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8</LINK> is the operative provision with regard to the notification of the State Authority's decision of an intention to acquire lands for a public purpose. The publication in the Gazette is a public notice to all persons, including the appellant, who is the registered proprietor of the lands in issue. Reliance was placed on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 ("the Interpretation Acts")</LINK> in support of this proposition which provision states as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> Reference was also made to several authorities by this apex court, ie <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_117;"><i>Mersing Omnibus Co Sdn Bhd v.

    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> In <i>Mersing Omnibus</i> and <i>Ravindran</i>, the apex court held that leave should not be granted unless the application for leave is made within six weeks (the prescribed time period then). However an extension of time can be granted provided the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction of the court, as governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 1A of the RHC 1980</LINK> [both cases were decided before the amendment to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 RHC 1980</LINK> in the year 2000].</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> In this case the Declaration of Intended Acquisition in Form D was gazetted on 9 June 2011. The application for leave to apply judicial review was filed on 11 August 2011. Computing time from the date of the gazette notification of Form D, there was accordingly a delay of 23 days in filing the said application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> The learned High Court Judge was right in holding that the 41 days time period prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> was jurisdictional. The Court of Appeal was right in affirming the decision of the High Court and not interfering with the High Court Judge's decision to extend time as no reason was given for delay warranting the court to exercise its discretionary power to extend time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> Counsel for 1st and 2nd respondents submitted that the answer to the questions posed must be answered as follows: that an application for leave for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> must be filed within 41 days from the date of the publication of Form D in the gazette, not from the service of the notice of enquiry in Form E on the registered proprietor of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The 3rd Respondent's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> Counsel for PKNK submitted, by reason the appellant having filed an appeal against the award made by the Land Administrator vide Form N pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK> on 27 September 2011 arising from the said acquisition, which appeal is now pending hearing in Alor Setar High Court, the land acquisition is now completed. The sum awarded has been duly paid into court by the Land Administrator. The appellant had also vacated the subject land, and development is now at an advanced stage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[101]</b> Counsel for PKNK submitted that the questions posed for determination before this court were academic. The Orders sought by the appellant would be an exercise of futility. The Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_1;"><i>Bato Bagi &amp; Ors v. Kerajaan Negeri Sarawak &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 297; [2011] 8 CLJ 766; [2011] 5 AMR 493 was cited as authority for this proposition.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[102]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 r 1</LINK> imposes an obligation on the decision maker to make a decision and to communicate the decision made. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 r 3(6)</LINK> then provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[103]</b> That date, when ascertained, and upon expiration of the prescribed time frame, such a decision then becomes "final" and immune to challenge. An aggrieved person is required to act "promptly", and in any event, not later than 41 days from "the date when the grounds for the application first arose" or "when the decision is first communicated to the respondent". The intention of the rules clearly is that it is in the public interest that an aggrieved person's right of access to the court has to yield to the need for a swift finality of the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[104]</b> Compliance with the time frame prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> is fundamental as it goes to jurisdiction. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_117;"><i>Mersing Omnibus Co Sdn Bhd v. The Minister Of Labour &amp; Manpower &amp; Anor</i> [1983] 1 MLRA 117</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 54; [1983] CLJ 266), where the appellant was out of time and had not sought an extension of time nor accounted for the delay, the Federal Court held that leave should not have been granted.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[107]</b> The critical issue in the questions posed for determination is, when does the "40 days" provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> start to run:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[108]</b> The application for leave to apply for judicial review in this case was filed by the appellant on 6 January 2008. The appellant had, in abundance of caution, applied for an extension of time in the event that it was filed out of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[109]</b> After careful consideration of the submission of parties, I am in agreement with the respondents' counsel submissions and not that of the appellant. I am of the view that the filing of an application for leave to apply for judicial review for an order of <i>certiorari</i> must be filed within 41 days of publication of Form D in the gazette and not from the date of service of Form E.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[110]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8</LINK> is clearly the operative provision with regard to the notification of the State Authority's decision to acquire land for a public purpose. If the law fixes the public with knowledge, and deems such knowledge to be a fact, a court must necessarily give effect to it. Clearly in respect of lands to be acquired for a public purpose the notification of such an intention of the State Authority by way of a publication in the gazette is the most practical and sensible way in which to give notice of such an intention. The publication of Form D in the gazette is a public notice to all persons, such as the appellant, the registered proprietor, of lands which was subjected to the acquisition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[112]</b> The Declaration of the Intended Acquisition in Form D in this case was gazetted on 9 June 2011. The application for judicial review was filed on 11 August 2011. The Court of Appeal was, in my view, correct in ruling that the 40 days time period prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> commenced from 9 June 2011 and that there was delay in filing the application for leave.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[113]</b> For the above reasons the answer to the questions posed in (i)(a) and (ii)(b) is accordingly answered in the affirmative. An application for leave to apply for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> must be filed within 40 days from the date of the publication of Form D in the gazette and not from the service of the notice of enquiry in Form E on the registered proprietor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[114]</b> Be that as it may, I am of the view that the facts and circumstances in this case warrant an exercise of the court's discretion to extend time in the appellant's favour. The State Authority's omission to reply to the appellant's letter 30 January 2011 containing the proposal that the appellant be allowed to continue with the development of the Plaza Tunku Yaacob Complex should have been taken into consideration. This failure of the State Authority to respond warrants the exercise of the court's power to extend time. In my view the fact that the appellant had attended the inquiry before the Land Administrator should not be held against them. In this case the appellant had in fact applied for an extension of time. There was sufficient material before the court to extend time. The application for extension should have been allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[115]</b> For this reason this appeal is allowed with costs. The case is remitted back to the High Court for a determination on the merits of the leave application.</p>
