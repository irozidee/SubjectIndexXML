    <p>The appellant was awarded a timber logging concession over 510,239 acres of land in Kelantan for 33 years by the State Government of Kelantan, the respondent herein. The appellant brought an action against the respondent in 2004 for the respondent's wrongful termination of the timber concession agreements on 18 March 1975. The respondent claimed that it terminated the agreements when the appellant failed to fulfill the minimum logging requirements in breach of the agreements. The appellant had, at the material time, sought the assistance of the Federal Government to help resolve its discontent over the termination of the agreements, as a result of which a meeting had been held on 17 June 1975 to resolve the dispute. The meeting involved officers from the respondent, representatives of the appellant and officers from the Federal Government. At the meeting, the parties agreed to explore the possibility of setting up a joint-venture company to undertake the work originally undertaken by the appellant under the agreements. Therefore, it was the appellant's case that the parties had agreed to a settlement agreement. On the other hand, the respondent made an interlocutory application to strike out the appellant's action under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_PUAS_1980_050;18.;;">O 18 r 19 of the then Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC')</LINK> on limitation grounds but the Registrar of the High Court dismissed the application. At the full trial, the learned judge allowed the appellant's claim. The decision, however, was reversed on appeal to the Court of Appeal, hence leading to the appellant's appeal herein. The main issue was whether the appellant's action was time-barred when it filed its action in 2004 since six years had long passed from the date of 18 March 1975, the date the agreements were terminated contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6 of the Limitation Act 1953 ('LA')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondent had properly and sufficiently pleaded limitation in its defence. Even though the LA was not mentioned by name in the defence, it would be sufficient for the respondent to aver therein that the appellant's claim was time-barred according to law. (paras 25-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The Registrar dismissed the respondent's application to strike out the appellant's claim under the RHC without providing any reasons. The respondent did not appeal against that decision and opted to carry on with the full trial. The limitation issue was in actual fact a point of law taken up before the High Court where the learned judge held that the action was not time-barred because the appellant continued to pursue the matter from the date of the purported termination with the respondent to the date of the purported settlement agreement and to the date of filing of this suit. Both sides argued the limitation issue in the Court of Appeal and the issue was raised and kept alive by the High Court. Therefore, it was not abandoned at any stage as contended by the appellant. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The Registrar's decision in the interlocutory application was not a final determinative of the limitation issue. It lacked the essential element of finality. The hearing and arguments were not exhaustive for the final determination. It was open to the High Court at the full trial to review the limitation issue based on the oral and documentary evidence presented by the parties. The effect of the Registrar's dismissal of the striking out application was simply that at the interlocutory stage, based on the limited materials then available, the respondent was not entitled to have the appellant's pleadings struck out on the grounds of limitation. Furthermore, the application was dismissed without reasons. It was therefore not possible to ascertain with any exactness the point decided by the Registrar. As such, <i>res judicata</i> could not apply because to constitute a <i>res judicata</i>, the earlier judgment must necessarily and with precision determine the point in issue. In the circumstances, the plea of <i>res judicata</i> should not prevail and the respondent was not precluded from raising the defence of limitation. (paras 28-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> None of the correspondence exchanged between the appellant and the respondent up to 2004 demonstrated any form of admission on the part of the respondent of liability or settlement. There was no negotiation that could be said to have bound the respondent in any way. The relevant letters only demonstrated disinterest and a lack of commitment on the part of the respondent. The respondent did not at any time, either by way of representation or conduct, unmistakably lead the appellant to believe that the respondent would not rely on the defence of limitation so long as settlement negotiations were ongoing. The stand taken by the appellant not to commence legal proceedings against the respondent before 2004 was the appellant's choice. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1981_254;29.;;">Section 29 the LA</LINK>, relating to fraud, did not apply because there was nothing to demonstrate any indication, representation or conduct by the respondent that it would not rely on the defence of limitation during the negotiations in the 1970's and 1980's, nor anything to demonstrate that there was any fraudulent concealment. Irrespective of any negotiations, the appellant was aware that its time was running out but chose not to enforce the rights it believed it had. The negotiations did not prevent limitation from running. At all times there was no admission of liability on the part of the respondent. Therefore the appellant was clearly time-barred from making its claim against the respondent. Time commenced from 18 March 1975. The appellant should have filed its claim on or before 17 March 1981 to preclude it from being defeated by the defence of limitation. Since the appellant filed its claim in 2004, it was clearly barred by limitation. (paras 40-43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The contemporaneous documentary evidence did not support the appellant's contention of the existence of any settlement agreement between the parties. Over the course of more than 20 years, there was no intention, decision or action taken to establish a joint venture between the parties. The evidence led by the appellant lacked the requisite components of a binding contract. It followed that there was no settlement agreement because there was no concluded contract between the parties. (para 55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The legal burden of the existence of the settlement agreement was with the appellant as the claimant in the present action. The fact that the respondent led no evidence or called no witnesses did not absolve the appellant from discharging its burden in law. On the facts, the appellant did not discharge that burden. (paras 56-57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> There was no oblique motive on the part of the respondent in not producing any witnesses. The termination of the agreements took place way before the filing of the action. This was a document-heavy dispute where the pertinent evidence was reduced into writing. It would not be appropriate to draw an adverse inference where there was no deliberate withholding or suppression of evidence. All the relevant documents were in the appellant's possession. Further, either party did not raise the question of adverse inference during the trial. The courts below did not make any finding of adverse inference. It was misplaced for the appellant to introduce the argument of adverse inference at this late stage. Moreover, it would not be appropriate to draw an adverse inference where a defendant elected not to call any evidence unless the plaintiff had proven its case on a balance of probability which the appellant herein failed to do so. (<i>Thong Foo Ching &amp; Ors v. Shigenori Ono (folld)</i>). (para 58)</p>

      <b>Azahar Mohamed FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by Syarikat Kemajuan Timbermine Sdn Bhd (the plaintiff in the High Court) pursuant to leave of this court given on 22 January 2014 to appeal against the whole decision of the Court of Appeal on the following question of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It would be convenient to describe the parties in this judgment as they appear in the High Court, namely the appellant as the plaintiff and the respondent as the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>An Overview Of The Dispute</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The subject matter of the dispute between the parties revolved around a timber logging concession over 510,239 acres of land in the State of Kelantan for a period of thirty three years awarded to the plaintiff by Kerajaan Negeri Kelantan Darul Naim (the defendant in the High Court).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff brought an action in the High Court at Kota Bharu against the defendant for damages based on a wrongful termination of the timber logging concession agreements made between the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The High Court had on 30 December 2009 allowed the plaintiff's claim. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal and on 6 August 2012, the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court orders. Hence, this appeal to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The background facts of the case which led to the plaintiff's appeal to this court have been well set out in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. We will rely on them to a large extent and set them out in the following paragraphs in so far they are relevant to the issues which arise for decision in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Pursuant to an agreement in writing dated 20 July 1964 ("Principal Agreement") made between the defendant and Timbermine Industrial Corporation Limited ("the company"), the defendant granted to the company, among others, the right to log and extract timber in accordance with the annual-extraction-quota in an area extending to 510,239 acres ("Specified Area"). The following are, among others, the most important expressed terms of the Principal Agreement:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Pursuant to the Principal Agreement, the company on 20 July 1964 paid to the defendant the sum of RM1 million being the first instalment. By way of a supplementary agreement dated 6 November 1965 ("Supplementary Agreement''), the Principal Agreement was varied, among others, to reduce the Specified Area from 510,239 acres to 280,000. The Supplementary Agreement included the following provision:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It is not disputed between the plaintiff and the defendant that on or about 7 February 1970, The rights of the company under the Principal and Supplementary Agreements were assigned to the plaintiff. Hereinafter we shall refer the Principal and Supplementary Agreements collectively as the Agreements. The defendant acknowledged the assignment vide letter dated 12 September 1970 and agreed to treat the first instalment of RM1 million paid by the company as payment made by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The dispute in present matter arose a few years later when the plaintiff failed to fulfil the minimum logging requirements in breach of certain clause of the agreements. By a letter dated 18 March 1975 The defendant terminated the agreements based on an alleged breach of cl 5(b)(i) of the agreements by the plaintiff for failing to log a specified target amount of timber within a stipulated period of time. The plaintiff in turn vide its solicitor's letter dated 21 April 1975 denied breaching the said provision and challenged the validity of the defendant's notice of termination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The plaintiff thereafter sought the assistance of the Federal Government to help resolve its discontent over the termination of the agreements. Subsequently a meeting was held on 17 June 1975 at the behest of the then Prime Minister to resolve the dispute and it was chaired by Tengku Ahmad Rithauddeen, the then Minister of Information and Special Functions. The meeting was attended, among others, by officers from the defendant, representatives of the plaintiff and also other officers from the Federal Government. What was decided at the meeting formed one of the contentious issues between the parties, about which more will be said at a later stage of this judgment. Suffice for us to say at this point that during the meeting, it was agreed that parties would explore the possibility of setting up a joint-venture company to undertake the work originally to be undertaken by the plaintiff under the agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Following the meeting, the plaintiff in a without prejudice letter dated 16 October 1975 put forward its proposals as to how the existing assets of the plaintiff should be dealt with upon the formation of the joint-venture company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> As there was no positive response from the defendant to the plaintiff's letter of 16 October 1975, the plaintiff pursued its proposals through the then Finance Minister of Malaysia, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. By its letter of 22 September 1976 addressed to Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, the plaintiff sought payment of the sum of RM3.5 million as goodwill; the formation of the joint-venture; for the joint-venture company to take over the assets belonging to the plaintiff and for the plaintiff to be awarded concession pending the formation of the joint-venture company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The proposals contained in the plaintiff's letter of 22 September 1976 were communicated to the defendant by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah vide his letter of 28 September 1976. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah expressly stated that his letter was "without prejudice" to whatever action had been taken by the plaintiff following the termination of the agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The defendant's response (letter dated 28 November 1976) to Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah's letter of 28 September 1976 was to effect payment of RM3.5 million to the plaintiff subject to the following qualification:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> As we shall see later in the judgment there was written communication between the plaintiff and the defendant for over twenty years from 1976 to 2002.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> However, as it turned out, the plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendant by filing a writ of summons and the statement of claim on 10 October 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In the main, the plaintiff anchored its claim against the defendant on two causes of action. The first is the unlawful termination of the agreements by the defendant. The second claim was based on the defendant's breach of the settlement agreement which was reached between the parties. Therefore, the alternative plaintiff's cause of action against the defendant was for damages suffered by the plaintiff arising from the plaintiff's failure to set up the joint-venture company pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> One of the defendant's pleaded defences was that the plaintiff's action was time-barred. The defendant also pleaded that the agreements were validly terminated and that there was no settlement agreement reached between the parties as the matters were merely at the stage of discussions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Proceedings At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> At the trial, the plaintiff called three witnesses. The defendant elected not to call any witness. As we have indicated earlier, the High Court allowed the plaintiff's claim and ruled, amongst others, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The High Court awarded the plaintiff the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Proceedings At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the High Court. The Court of Appeal, among others, held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the plaintiff raised several grounds in support of the appeal. Nevertheless, we think the critical and primary issues which arose for determination in this appeal revolved around two issues. The first is whether the plaintiff's claim is time-barred, and the second is whether there was a legally enforceable settlement agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether The Plaintiff's Claim Is Time-Barred?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Limitation Act 1953 ("the 1953 Act")</LINK> stipulates and restricts the period during which an action may be brought to enforce a contractual right. The specific provision in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">the 1953 Act is s 6(1)(a)</LINK> which provides that an action founded on contract shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued. The point in issue is that according to the defendant, the plaintiff's cause of action accrued on the date of termination of the agreements, that is to say, on 18 March 1975 and that six years had long passed when the plaintiff filed this action in 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(i) Whether Limitation Is Sufficiently Pleaded?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As a starting point, the significant point to note is that the defence of limitation was properly and sufficiently pleaded by the defendant in para 18 of its defence which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Even though <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">the 1953 Act</LINK> was not mentioned by name in the defence, it would be sufficient, in our judgment, for the defendant to aver in the defence that the plaintiff's claim is time-barred according to law (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1976_1_152;"><i>Re Estate Of Choong Lye Hin, Deceased; Choong Gim Guan v. Choong Gim Seong</i> [1976] 1 MLRA 152</LINK>; [1977] 1 MLJ 96 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1994_1_903;"><i>Mariam Binti Shaik Mohd Omar v. Ong Chin Poh</i> [1994] 1 MLRH 903</LINK>; [1994] 3 MLJ 419; [1994] 3 CLJ 635).</p>
    <p>
      <b>(ii) Whether The Defendant Had Abandoned The Limitation Defence?</b>
    </p>
    <p>[27] It is relevant to note that the defendant had prior to the trial of the action applied to strike out the plaintiff's claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_PUAS_1980_050;18.;;">O 18 r 19 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> on the ground that the claim was barred by limitation. However, the application was dismissed by the Registrar of the High Court without giving reasons. The defendant did not appeal against this decision and opted to carry on with a full trial. Since there was no appeal from this decision, the principal contention by the plaintiff's learned counsel is that this was a clear case of abandonment of the limitation defence by the defendant. We do not think so. Limitation issue was in actual fact a point of law taken up before the High Court as can be seen in the grounds of judgment where the learned High Court Judge held that the action was not time barred because "the plaintiff continued to pursue the matter from the date of the purported termination with the defendant to the date of purported Settlement Agreement and to the date of filing of this suit" and "the defendant did not appeal against the decision" of the Registrar dismissing the application to strike out the plaintiff's writ of summons and statement of claim on ground of limitation of time. In our view, the limitation issue had been argued by both sides in the Court of Appeal and this issue had so been raised and kept alive by the High Court, thus was not at any stage abandoned as contended by learned counsel for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(iii) Whether <i>Res Judicata</i> Can Apply?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> This leads on to the question of whether the issue of limitation was <i>res judicata</i> for the reason that there was no appeal from the decision of the Registrar in dismissing the defendant's application to strike out the claim on the ground that it was time-barred. As a matter of general principle when a matter has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, the parties and their privies are not permitted to litigate once more the res judicata (a matter adjudged) because the judgment becomes the truth between such parties, or in other words, the parties should accept it as the truth (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_611;"><i>Asia Commercial Finance (M) Berhad v. Kawal Teliti Sdn. Bhd</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 611</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 189; [1995] 3 CLJ 783; [1995] 3 AMR 2559). On this point, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We agree with the above findings of the Court of Appeal. To which we will add that the decision of the Registrar in the interlocutory application is not finally determinative of the limitation issue. It lacked the essential element of finality. The hearing and arguments during the interlocutory application stage were not exhaustive for the final determination of the limitation issue. It is open to the High Court at the full trial to review the limitation issue based on the evidence, both oral and documentary, presented by the parties (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_333;"><i>Selvaraju Ponniah v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Awam &amp; Anor</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 333</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 585; [2006] 2 CLJ 150; [2006] 3 AMR 218). The effect of the Registrar's dismissal of the application for striking out was simply that at the interlocutory stage, based on the limited material then available, the defendant was not entitled to have the plaintiff's pleadings struck out on the ground of limitation (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1988_1_132;"><i>Cheng Hang Guan &amp; Ors v. Perumahan Farlim (Pg) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1988] 1 MLRH 132</LINK>; [1988] 3 MLJ 90 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1983_2_401;"><i>Florence Bailes v. Dr Ng Jit Leong</i> [1983] 2 MLRH 401</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 175). What is more, as we have said earlier, the application for striking out was dismissed by the Registrar without providing any reasons. It is therefore not possible to ascertain with any exactness the point decided by the Registrar. That is why <i>
res judicata</i> cannot apply because to constitute a <i>res judicata</i>, the earlier judgment must necessarily and with precision determine the point in issue (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_81;"><i>The Pacific Bank Bhd v. Chan Peng Leong</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 81</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 613; [1998] 2 CLJ 440; [1998] 2 AMR 1895). We agree with the submission of learned counsel for the defendant that in the circumstances of the present case the plea of <i>res judicata</i> should not prevail. We therefore hold that the defendant is not precluded from raising the defence of limitation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(iv) Whether The Defendant Is Estopped From Relying On The Defence Of Limitation?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the defendant was estopped from relying on the defence of limitation in respect of the unlawful termination of the agreements as the defendant had induced the plaintiff to forbear from commencing court proceedings. He added that the defendant was estopped from raising the defence of limitation by reason that there were continuous negotiations between the parties on the termination of the agreements up until the filing of the present action and that the defendant had encouraged the plaintiff to believe that it did not have to pursue legal remedies to enforce the agreements. Relying on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_356;"><i>Sia Siew Hong &amp; Ors v. Lim Gim Chian &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 356</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 141; [1996] 3 CLJ 26; [1996] 3 AMR 3651, learned counsel argued that the defendant was estopped from relying on the statute of limitation for otherwise, the statute of limitation would be used as "an engine of fraud".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On the other hand, learned counsel for the defendant argued that it was plain from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff at trial that there were long periods of silence, for example from 1977 to the mid-late 1980's, and inactivity from the plaintiff wherein limitation had expired and the plaintiff was seen to have abandoned any claim it might have had.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> On the "continuous negotiations" point raised by the plaintiff, the Court of Appeal made the following important findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Based on the evidence produced by the plaintiff, it was entirely reasonable and right for the Court of Appeal to conclude that limitation had lapsed and that the learned High Court Judge was plainly wrong in holding otherwise. The Court of Appeal rightly took the approach of considering the documents and evidence adduced during the trial in totality; the learned High Court Judge did not do so and ignored or failed to analyse and take into consideration the facts as a whole.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> As aptly described by learned counsel for the defendant, this commercial case involving a state government and a corporate entity was a "document-heavy dispute" where the relevant evidence was reduced to writing. Given that this was a "document-heavy dispute", in our view, the Court of Appeal was entitled to make its decision based on those contemporaneous documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_441;"><i>Len Min Kong v. United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd &amp; Anor Appeal</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 441</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 478; [1998] 2 CLJ 879; [1998] 3 AMR 2641 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_665;"><i>Eastern &amp; Oriental Hotel (1951) Sdn Bhd v. Ellarious George Fernandez &amp; Anor</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 665</LINK>; [1989] 1 MLJ 35; [1988] 1 CLJ 50 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_81;"><i>Tindok Besar Estate Sdn Bhd v. Tinjar Co</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 81</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 229).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> As mentioned earlier, the defendant terminated the agreements vide latter dated 18 March 1975. The letter clearly reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> By letter dated 21 April 1975, the plaintiff merely stated that it did not accept the validity of the termination and threatened to take relevant action. The material part of the letter reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The plaintiff challenged the termination vide the above letter of 21 April 1975. Despite its intention of taking action, the plaintiff only filed the action in 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> From the documents tendered at trial, it can be seen that there was no written communication between the plaintiff and the defendant for over ten years from 1977 to 1989. From evidence adduced the plaintiff had not done anything to enforce any right arising from any alleged wrongful termination from 1977 (after the letter from the defendant dated 28 July 1977 expressing that the State Government is in the process of studying future developments (exh P21)) right until its letter dated 14 November 1989 to the defendant (exh P22). The plaintiff further failed to do anything from 1989 until it sent a letter 24 January 1995 (exh P23) and remained silent from 1996 until 25 June 2002 (exh P25A).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It is plain for us to see from a reading of the Record of Appeal that none of the correspondence exchanged between the plaintiff and the defendant up to 2004 demonstrated any form of admission on the part of the defendant and there was no negotiation that could be said to have bound the defendant in any way. Those letters only demonstrate disinterest and a lack of commitment on the part of the defendant. Based on the evidence, we are in complete agreement with the finding of the Court of Appeal that the defendant did not at any time either by way of representation or conduct unmistakably cause the plaintiff to believe that the defendant would not rely on the defence of limitation so long as settlement negotiations were ongoing. In our view the stand taken by the plaintiff not to commence legal proceedings against the defendant before 2004 was of the plaintiff's choice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We would place our emphasis here that the Court of Appeal was rightly satisfied that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;29.;;">s 29 of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, relating to fraud, did not apply because there was nothing to demonstrate any indication, representation or conduct by the defendant that it would not rely on the defence of limitation during the negotiations in the 1970's and 1980's, nor anything to demonstrate that there was any fraudulent concealment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Irrespective of any negotiations, the plaintiff was aware that its time was running out but chose not to enforce the rights it believed it had. As stated by <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> 30th edn vol 1 (para 28-111):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In the present case the fact that limited negotiations took place before 1977 did not prevent limitation from continuing to run and expiring. The correspondence up to 2004 clearly showed that at all times there was no admission of liability on the part of the defendant, therefore the plaintiff is clearly time barred to make any claim against the defendant. Unlike the cases cited by the learned authors of <i>Chitty on Contract (supra)</i> where limitation could not be pleaded because there was an admission of liability, in the present case there was never any admission of liability by the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> On the limitation issue, we conclude by saying that time commenced to run for the purposes of the 1953 Act from 18 March 1975. Therefore, the plaintiff should have filed its claim on or before 17 March 1981 to preclude the same from being defeated by the defence of limitation. Since the plaintiff filed this claim on 8 October 2004, it is barred by limitation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Any Settlement Agreement Came Into Existence?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> From this point on, we shall address the issue of whether a settlement agreement came into existence based on the minutes of the meeting of 17 June 1975. The main thrust of the contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff was that at the meeting parties reached consensus on a mode of settling the entire dispute by agreeing to form a joint venture company which would continue to carry out logging in the Specified Area and that equity in the joint venture company was to be split between the parties whereby the defendant was to be given a 70% stake and the plaintiff was to be given a 30% stake. This consensus was referred to by learned counsel as the 'settlement agreement'. It was further contended that the settlement agreement was subsequently varied by the parties sometime in November 1976 to include the following additional terms. First, the defendant to pay the sum of RM3.5 million as a gesture of goodwill to the plaintiff and secondly, the plaintiff was not to commence legal action against the defendant to enforce its rights in the Specified Area.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> On the settlement agreement issue, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We are in full agreement with the Court of Appeal that as no evidence was produced by the plaintiff, we conclude that no settlement agreement was ever reached between the parties. It is trite that any potential agreement binding the parties being subject to contract require the execution of a formal agreement containing the terms (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_204;"><i>Kheamhuat Holdings Sdn Bhd v. The Indian Association, Penang</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 204</LINK>; [2006] 4 MLJ 656; [2006] 2 CLJ 1040; [2000] 4 AMR 3983, <i>Nicolene, Ltd v. Simmonds</i> [1953] 1 All ER 822 and <i>BSkyB Ltd and Another v. HP Enterprise Services UK Ltd (formerly Electronic Data Systems Ltd) and Another</i> [2010] EWHC 86).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> It is quite plain to us that the meeting of 17 June 1975 chaired by Tengku Ahmad Rithauddeen, which was held on a without prejudice basis was not based on legal relationship arising from the termination of the agreements. This was clearly stated in the minutes of meeting as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> When one carefully looks at the minutes of the meeting, what stands out is that it expressly states "the object of the meeting was merely to discuss the possibility of setting up joint-venture" between the parties. The language in the said minutes does not admit any ambiguity. It is entirely inconsistent and is diametrically opposed to the contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff and the learned High Court Judge's decision that a settlement agreement was concluded between the plaintiff and the defendant. Significantly, as we have indicated earlier, subsequent to the meeting of 17 June 1975, in a letter dated 16 October 1975 to the defendant, the plaintiff outlined the proposed terms of the joint-venture company (makeup, directorship, capital) but the evidence showed that the defendant never responded. In this regard, we wholly agree with what the Court of Appeal said on the plaintiff's proposal as encapsulated in the letter dated 16 October 1975:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> It is pertinent to note that the Court of Appeal cited the English case of <i>JH Milner &amp; Son v. Percy Bilton, Ltd</i> [1966] 2 All ER 894, where a solicitor wrote to a prospective client with whom there was not yet any legal arrangement: "may we please take this opportunity of placing on record the understanding that all the legal work of and incidental to the completion of the development and the grant of the leases, shall be carried out by us". When the solicitor attempted to argue that this constituted a binding and enforceable agreement that court held that this merely amounted to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Likewise in the present case, in our view, the contemporaneous documentary evidence adduced only fortifies that the defendant was taking into consideration the possibility of entering into a joint-venture agreement, not that a formal agreement had been made. It was still merely considering the possibility of entering into a joint-venture agreement. The first is the letter of Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah as the Minister of Finance dated 28 September 1976 to the Menteri Besar of Kelantan. The material part of the letter reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The Court of Appeal made an important observation on Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah's letter dated 28 September 1976 letter, which we respectfully agree and reproduced as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The second is the letter from YAB Dato' Haji Muhammad Nasir as the Menteri Besar of Kelantan to the plaintiff dated 28 November 1976. The relevant portion of the letter reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> From the above contemporaneous letters, it can be seen that the without prejudice payment of RM3.5 million was actually a gesture of goodwill from the defendant to the plaintiff for the development in Kelantan that the plaintiff had undertaken and was a result of the mediation efforts of high-ranking political figures, and was not related to the termination of the agreements or the execution of a settlement agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The third is a letter from Dato' Nik Sulaiman as the Kelantan's State Secretary to the plaintiff dated 28 July 1977. The pertinent part of the letter states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> From the above, in our view, the contemporaneous documentary evidence compellingly points to this: there was never an unconditional commitment by the defendant to enter into any form of settlement agreement with the plaintiff. We have tested the plaintiff's position against the contemporaneous documents and we find that there is no evidence that supports the plaintiff's contention of the existence of any settlement agreement between parties. Given that over the course of more than 20 years no such agreement was ever concluded, it is plain that there was never a very strong intention and no final decision was made nor was any definitive action taken to establish such a joint venture between the parties. Therefore, one thing is clear. The evidence led by the plaintiff failed to establish the existence of a legally enforceable settlement agreement given that the documentary evidence showed a lack of the requisite components of a binding contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. There could not be a settlement agreement because there was indeed no concluded contract between the parties. The Court of Appeal was for that reason correct to conclude that no settlement agreement ever came into existence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether The Plaintiff Has Met The Burden Of Proof Where The Defendant Elected Not To Call Any Witnesses?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the Court of Appeal ought not to disturb findings of fact by the High Court. He added that the Court of Appeal had gone beyond its appellate powers in this case as the reversal and substitutions of the findings of facts was wholly unjustified and therefore the judgment of the Court of Appeal should therefore be set aside. It was further submitted that the evidence led by the plaintiff must be assumed to be true when the defendant elected not to call any witnesses. On these submissions we have two observations to make. The first is that the principle on which an appellate court could interfere with findings of fact by the trial court is the plainly wrong test (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_1;"><i>Gan Yook Chin &amp; Anor v. Lee Ing Chin &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 1; [2004] 4 CLJ 309; [2004] 6 AMR 781 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_2_668;"><i>UEM Group Bhd v. Genisys Integrated Engineers Pte Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 2 MLRA 668</LINK>; [2010] 9 CLJ 785). And the second is that the burden of proof at all times is of course borne by the plaintiff to establish on the balance of probability the existence of a legally enforceable settlement agreement (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_2_116;"><i>Ranbaxy (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v. Ei Du Pont De Nemours And Company [2011] 2 MLRH 116</i></LINK>). In other words, it was upon the plaintiff itself, and certainly not the defendant, to discharge the burden of showing the settlement agreement had come into existence. It is for the plaintiff to prove its case and satisfy the court that its claim is well-founded before the court grants judgment on the claim (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_1;"><i>Pemilik Dan Kesemua Orang Lain Yang Berkepentingan Dalam Kapal "Fordeco No 12" Dan "Fordeco No 17" v.

Fortune Wealth (H-K) Ltd &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 832</LINK>; [2004] 4 MLJ 105; [2004] 4 CLJ 282; [2004] 6 AMR 319 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_592;"><i>Teh Swee Lip v. Jademall Holdings Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 592</LINK>; [2013] 6 MLJ 32; [2014] 8 CLJ 451; [2013] 5 AMR 666). It is true that in the present case the defendant elected not to call any witnesses. However, it is imperative to bear in mind that from the outset the legal burden of the existence of the settlement agreement was with the plaintiff as the claimant in the present action. By reasons of the legal principles, the fact that the defendant led no evidence or call no witnesses did not absolve the plaintiff from discharging its burden in law. In this regard, in adopting the approach of the case of <i>Storey v. Storey</i> [1961] P 63, Suriyadi Halim Omar JCA (as His Lordship then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_3_247;"><i>Mohd Nor Afandi Mohamed Junus v. Rahman Shah Alang Ibrahim &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 3 MLRA 247</LINK>; [2008] 3 MLJ 81; [2008] 2 CLJ 369 recognised this to be the case as can be seen from the following passage of His Lordship's judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We therefore agree with the submission of learned counsel for the defendant to the effect that despite the fact the defendant did not call any witness and that even if the plaintiff's evidence is unopposed (and therefore presumed to be true), this does not automatically equate to that evidence satisfying the burden of proving the existence of the settlement agreement borne by the plaintiff, or mean that the burden of proving on the balance of probabilities no longer applies, or that a case to answer is automatically made out. The evidence adduced by the plaintiff must still be sufficient to prove the existence of the settlement agreement. This crucial point was overlooked by the learned High Court Judge. On the factual matrix of the case, it is patently clear that the plaintiff has not discharged the burden. On this basis, the Court of Appeal was in every respect justified in holding that the learned High Court Judge was plainly wrong in making a ruling of law that the settlement agreement had come into existence based on the conduct of both parties. Indeed, the election by the defendant to call no evidence at trial does not preclude the reversal of a plainly wrong findings of the learned High Court Judge by the Court of Appeal.</p>

      <b>Whether Adverse Inferences To Be Drawn Against The Defendant From The Failure To Call Any Witnesses And To Adduce Evidence?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff also argued that the failure to adduce evidence and call any witnesses would, in his words, 'attract all the usual debilitative factors including the drawing of adverse inferences'. The statutory basis for the drawing of an adverse inference is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> which provides that the court may presume that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. Adverse inference under that provision can be drawn if there is a withholding or suppression of evidence and not merely on account of failure to obtain evidence (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_418;"><i>Low Kian Boon &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 418</LINK>; [2010] 4 MLJ 425; [2010] 5 CLJ 489 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_292;"><i>Munusamy Vengadasalam v. PP</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 292</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 492; [1987] CLJ 221). We do not detect any oblique motive on the part of the defendant in not producing any witnesses. In any event, such an inference would have been inappropriate in the context of the present case. The termination of the agreements took place around thirty years before the filing of the action. We have said earlier, as a commercial case, this was a document-heavy dispute where the pertinent evidence was reduced to writing. It would not be appropriate to draw the inference where there has been no deliberate withholding or suppression of evidence as all the relevant documents were in the plaintiff's possession. Besides, as rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the defendant, as the question of adverse inference was not raised by either party during the trial, the learned High Court Judge and the Court of Appeal did not make any finding of adverse inference. It is misplaced for the plaintiff to introduce the argument of an adverse inference being drawn at this late stage. Moreover, as regards to the non-calling of any witnesses by the defendant, the <i>ratio</i> in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_121;"><i>Thong Foo Ching &amp; Ors v. Shigenori Ono</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 121</LINK> at p 133 ; [1998] 4 MLJ 585; [1998] 4 CLJ 674; [1998] 4 AMR 4079 will be applicable in the present case. In that case, Siti Norma Yaakob JCA (as Her Ladyship then was) in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal held that it would not be appropriate to draw an adverse inference where a defendant elects not to call any evidence unless the plaintiff has proven its case on a balance of probability. We adopt the principle of law as stated by the Court of Appeal in <i>Thong Foo Ching &amp; Ors v. Shigenori Ono (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In light of our findings and in the circumstances of this case, it is unnecessary for us to answer the question as framed. In consequence, this appeal must fail. We accordingly dismiss it with costs. We order the deposit to be refunded to the plaintiff.</p>
