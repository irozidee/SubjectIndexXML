    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This appeal concerned a single issue of entitlement to a compensation sum arising from the compulsory acquisition of a piece of land which was subject to a charge where the chargee was the appellant ("the bank"). The bank had provided a loan on the security of a third party charge over the said land granted by the respondent. Subsequently, the respondent was declared a bankrupt, and the bank filed a Proof of Debt ("POD") under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Bankruptcy Act 1967 ("the Act")</LINK>. The land that was the subject of the third party charge was subsequently vested in the Director-General of Insolvency ("DGI"). The POD filed by the bank was ambivalent on whether, on its face, the bank had surrendered its security or had merely proved for the balance outstanding after giving value or realising its security. The DGI argued that the bank was only entitled to a <i>pari passu</i> sum, since it had surrendered its security in the charged land, while the bank argued that it was entitled to the full sum of the compensation since it had not surrendered its security merely by filing the POD. Following that, the bank also argued that the DGI, by its previous conduct, should be estopped from maintaining that the bank was not entitled to the full sum. In the High Court, the trial judge had dismissed the bank's appeal, by relying on the operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8(2A) of the Act</LINK>, noting that the bank had realised their secured interest "only after some nine years" from the date the respondent was adjudicated a bankrupt. Accordingly, the issues to be decided here were, <i>inter alia</i>, whether the compensation sum from the compulsory acquisition of land could be apportioned; whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8(2A) of the Act</LINK> barred the bank's realisation of security beyond six months; whether the bank could be assumed to have given up or surrendered its security based on its conduct; and whether the DGI was estopped by its conduct from maintaining that the bank had given up its security.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant appeal, the correct and accepted position in relation to the status of any compensation sum where the property was a charged property over which the charge had not been discharged, was the decision in <i>Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd v. The Government Of The State Of Sabah &amp; Ors</i>, where it was held that it would be wrong in principle to apportion a compensation sum since "a charge is indivisible and the security is attached to the whole property", and it followed that "until the property is discharged, the interest (of the chargee) is on the whole property and any proceeds of the sale of the property will attach to the whole property." (paras 5-6)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was a glaring error by the trial judge, since <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8(2A) of the Act</LINK> was irrelevant for purposes of the bank's application for POD. The said section merely referred to the bank's entitlement to claim further interest on top of the indebtedness as at the date of the receiving order. It did not operate as a complete bar to any realisation of the security beyond the six months' period under the provision. Thus, it was evident that there had been no proper judicial appreciation of the facts and the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8(2A) of the Act</LINK>. (paras 10-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> and the rules provided in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Schedule C of the Act</LINK>, there was little scope for any "assumption" that the bank as secured creditor had elected to surrender its security just by filing a POD for the full sum of indebtedness without the election being unequivocal. The POD filed was ambiguous and did not state expressly that the bank was surrendering the security nor did it state that the bank was attaching a value to the security, and hence proving in the bankruptcy for the shortfall. Here, the principle in <i>Moor v. Anglo-Italian Bank</i> that there was "no rule in bankruptcy that a petitioning creditor who omits in his petition either to give an estimate of the value of his security or to state that he will be ready to give up his security for the benefit of the creditors in the event of his debtor being adjudicated bankrupt, thereby forfeits the benefit of his security" was applicable. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The DGI in this case had written to the bank seeking its confirmation on the payment of the compensation sum and inquiring whether the bank was willing to forego the shortfall. Therefore, a finding that the bank had given up the security for the benefit of the general creditors would be obviously perverse. Further, it was no answer to say that the bank should have participated in the acquisition hearing. It was not in the know, and by the charge the obligation was on the chargor, ie the DGI to inform the Bank of any land acquisition. The DGI could not turn the tables in its favour, and seek to place the blame on the bank. (paras 26-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Given the conduct of the DGI, this was a suitable case to apply the doctrine of estoppel against the DGI. The conduct of the bank had been so influenced by the DGI that it would be unconscionable for the DGI to insist on his strict rights under bankruptcy law, even on the assumption that these rights were supportable on the law. Furthermore, the facts did not demonstrate an unequivocal surrender of the security by the bank. The court was entitled to look at the conduct of the bank and assess whether it had surrendered the security. Since the title to the land had been transferred to the DGI, it was incumbent on the DGI to respect this express contractual promise, unless the evidence was clear that the bank had surrendered its contractual rights. In this instance, there were serious errors of law and a serious failure to appreciate the material facts that warranted appellate intervention. (<i>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad (folld)</i>). (paras 29-32)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal concerns a single issue of entitlement to a compensation sum arising from the compulsory acquisition of a piece of land which was subject to a charge under the National Code where the chargee was Malayan Banking Berhad, the appellant ("bank"). The bank had provided a loan on the security of a third party charge over the said land granted by Boau Yoon Fut @ Wong Yoon Fut, the respondent. The respondent was subsequently declared a bankrupt, and the bank filed a Proof of Debt under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Bankruptcy Act 1967 ("the Act")</LINK>. The land that was the subject of the third party charge was subsequenttly vested in the Director-General of Insolvency following the making of the Adjudication and Receiving Orders by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The facts of this appeal are peculiar, and counsel for the parties (the DGI representing the Bankrupt) concede that there is as yet no direct case authority in point in Malaysia. The Proof of Debt ("POD") filed by the bank is ambivalent on whether on its face the Bank has surrendered its security or has merely proved for the balance outstanding after giving value or realising its security. The facts have required us to consider in some detail the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;42.;;">s 42</LINK> and <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Schedule C of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Can the bank in such circumstances be presumed to have surrendered its security and therefore entitled only to a <i>pari passu</i> shares in the assets of the bankrupt by way of dividends? On the precise facts, is the bank merely entitled to a <i>pari passu</i> share in the compensation sum or to the full sum?</p>
    <p>It is the view of the DGI that the bank is entitled to merely a <i>pari passu</i> sum, since it has surrendered its security in the charged land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The bank, on the other hand, argues it is entitled to the full sum of the compensation since it has not surrendered its security merely by filing the POD. The bank further argues the DGI, by its previous conduct, should be estopped from maintaining that the bank is not entitled to the full sum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The bank relies, among other authorities, on the Supreme Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_125;"><i>Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd v. The Government Of The State Of Sabah &amp; Ors</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 125</LINK>; [1994] 2 MLJ 193; [1994] 2 CLJ 475; [1994] 2 AMR 1017, where the court held it would be wrong in principle to apportion a compensation sum since "a charge is indivisible and the security is attached to the whole property", and it follows that "until the property is discharged, the interest [of the chargee] is on the whole property and any proceeds of the sale of the property will attach to the whole property."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We are of the view that this is the correct and accepted position in relation to the status of any compensation sum where the property is a charged property over which the charge has not been discharged, unless of course the bank/ chargee has elected under bankruptcy law to forego its security and claim for the total indebtedness against the estate and assets of the bankrupt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Procedurally, this appeal concerns the Notice of Application (encl 19A) filed by the bank under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;40.;;">ss 40</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;42.;;">42 of the Act</LINK> and <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Schedule C, para 28</LINK> thereunder, for the following relief:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Senior Assistant Registrar who heard the application dismissed the appeal. The High Court Judge also dismissed the bank's appeal from this decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It is clear from the learned judge's grounds of judgment that the High Court Judge relied on the operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8(2A) of the Act</LINK> to dismiss the appeal, noting that the bank had realised their secured interest "only after some nine years" from the date the respondent was adjudicated a bankrupt. The learned judge referred to the recent Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_3_298;"><i>Pilecon Realty Sdn Bhd v. Public Bank Berhad &amp; Ors</i> [2013] 3 MLRA 298</LINK>; [2013] 3 MLJ 1; [2013] 2 CLJ 893; [2013] 4 AMR 481.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> With respect, there is a glaring error here, since <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8(2A)</LINK> is irrelevant for purposes of the application made. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">Section 8(2A)</LINK> merely refers to the bank's entitlement to claim further interest (not an interest in the security sense) on top of the indebtedness as at the date of the Receiving Order. The section does not operate as a complete bar to any realisation of the security beyond the six months' period under the provision. It is evident that there has been no proper judicial appreciation of the facts and the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8(2A)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In the interest of certainty and proper understanding, we quote the relevant parts of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;8.;;">s 8 of the Act</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The issue of interest is completely irrelevant on the facts of the appeal. Indeed, the compensation sum (RM631,309.50) is even less that the indebtedness to the bank (according to the POD filed, the indebtedness is RM1,122,794.97).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The critical issue in this appeal is still the short issue whether the bank can be assumed to have given up or surrendered its security on the facts and on the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We have considered the provisions in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Schedule C of the Act</LINK>, and the exact terms of the POD filed which appear on pp 177-182 of the Appeal Record, vol 2. We have further considered the elucidation of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">paras 9 to 17 of Schedule C of the Act</LINK> in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_5_407;"><i>Malayan Banking Bhd v. The Official Assignee</i> [1993] 5 MLRH 407</LINK>; [1993] 2 AMR 3400, as followed in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_528;"><i>K Balasubramaniam (Likuidator Bagi Kosmopolitan Credit &amp; Leasing Sdn Bhd) v. Mbf Finance Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 528</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 201; [2005] 1 CLJ 793; [2005] 1 AMR 585.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In summary, a secured creditor has three "elections" under Bankruptcy Law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> To quote these express provisions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The court in <i>Malayan Banking Bhd v. The Official Assignee (supra)</i>, has laid down the general principles very clearly:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;42.;;">Section 42</LINK> is equally express. It provides that the rules in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Schedule C</LINK> "shall" be observed with respect "to the mode of proving debts, the right of proof by secured and other creditors, the admission and rejection of proofs and other matters." It seems to us that in this respect there is little scope for any "assumption" that the bank as secured creditor has elected to surrender its security just by filing a POD for the full sum of indebtedness without the election being unequivocal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The POD filed is ambiguous. It does not state expressly that the bank is surrendering the security. Nor does it state that the bank is attaching a value to the security, and hence proving in the bankruptcy for the shortfall. Here is where the principle in the old common law case of <i>Moor v. Anglo-Italian Bank</i> [1879] 10 ChD 681, becomes very relevant. According to this authority, there is "no rule in bankruptcy that a petitioning creditor who omits in his petition either to give an estimate of the value of his security or to state that he will be ready to give up his security for the benefit of the creditors in the event of his debtor being adjudicated bankrupt, thereby forfeits the benefit of his security."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The facts of this appeal also establish that the DGI did not see it fits to respond to the bank promptly although the POD had been filed with an ambiguity. We agree with the bank's argument that the DGI is required under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">para 26, Schedule C</LINK> to reply stating whether he admitted or rejected the POD in writing:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The DGI did not formally respond in the manner laid down, but responded only some two years later in terms recognising the bank as a secured creditor and seeking the bank's confirmation whether it was willing to forego its shortfall if the full compensation sum was paid to it. The Land Administrator had earlier paid the compensation sum directly to the DGI.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The POD was filed on 26 November 2008. The 1st response came on 11 October 2010.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The bank then wrote to the DGI and asked that the compensation sum be paid to the bank. However, in a turn of events, the DGI then rejected the request. The ground raised for the rejection was that the bank had surrendered its security. This was made known to the bank on 11 December 2011, and again on 16 July 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We have considered the factual sequence carefully in order to place the positions taken by the DGI and the bank in proper context. The AO/RO was made on 8 December 2004. The charged property was vested in the DGI on 18 May 2005. Although the POD was filed on 26 November 2008, the bank had proceeded earlier to obtain an order for sale of the charged property that it obtained on 8 September 2008. The bank proceeded further to apply for Summons for Directions and to fix an auction date on 10 June 2009. The auction date was fixed for 1 September 2009, with a reserve price of RM631,310.00. It appears that the DGI's representative was present in court on the hearing of the Summons for Directions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It was at this stage that the compulsory acquisition intruded. The bank claims it came to know of the land acquisition only on 18 January 2010, when it did a land search.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As we have seen earlier, on 11 October 2010 the DGI wrote to the bank seeking its confirmation on the payment of the compensation sum and inquiring whether the bank was willing to forego the "shortfall".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In these circumstances, a finding that the bank had given up the security for the benefit of the general creditors will be obviously perverse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It is no answer to say that the bank should have participated in the acquisition hearing. It was not in the know, and by the charge the obligation was on the chargor (meaning in this context, the DGI) to inform the bank of any land acquisition. The DGI cannot now turn the tables in its favour, and seek to place the blame on the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Given the conduct of the DGI, this, to our mind, affords a suitable case to apply the doctrine of estoppel against the DGI under the principles laid down in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_738;"><i>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 738</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 331; [1995] 4 CLJ 283; [1995] 3 AMR 2871. The conduct of the bank has been so influenced by the DGI that it will be unconscionable for the DGI to insist on his strict rights under bankruptcy law, even on the assumption that these rights are supportable on the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In any event, the facts do not demonstrate an unequivocal surrender of the security by the bank. The court is entitled to look at the conduct of the bank and assess whether it has surrendered the security. The Australian cases cited by counsel for the bank (<i>Provident Capital Limited v. Kelso Builders Supplies Pty Limited (In Liquidation)</i> 66 ACSR 643, <i>Re Douglas Homes Qld Pty Ltd (In Liq)</i> [1980] 3 ACLR 715 and <i>Surfers Paradise Investments Pty Limited (In Liq) v. Davoren Nominee Pty Limited</i> [2003] QCA 458) are very helpful pointers on the principles to be employed although they deal with companies winding-up).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> All said and done, the facts here concern a banking transaction where primacy has to be accorded to the documentary terms and conditions in the interest of certainty and predictability of commercial transactions. The provisions in the charge Annexure are clear. Clause 12 governs "Government Acquisition", and under cl 12.3(a), all monies received as compensation shall be applied towards the discharge or repayment of monies secured by the charge, and "the chargor shall and hereby declares that it will hold such monies as received in trust for the bank." With respect, since the title to the land has been transferred to the DGI, it is incumbent on the DGI to respect this express contractual promise, unless the evidence is clear that the bank has surrendered its contractual rights.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> For the reasons we have discussed above, we are of the opinion that there have been serious errors of law and a serious failure to appreciate the material facts to an extent that appellate intervention is warranted. We are therefore allowing this appeal and setting aside the orders of the High Court Judge and the Senior Assistant Registrar dated 30 April 2014 and 18 March 2014 respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We order further that the appellant's application in encl 19A (Notis Permohonan dated 21 November 2013) be allowed as prayed in paras (i) and (ii).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We also set aside the orders on costs below and make no order as to costs for this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Deposit is refunded to the appellant.</p>
