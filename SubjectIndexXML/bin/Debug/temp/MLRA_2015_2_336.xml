    <p>The respondent had purchased two vacant lots of adjoining land. At the time of its purchase, there were neither electricity transmission lines nor electricity transmission towers on the two lots. There was also no endorsement on the Register Document of Title. Subsequent to the purchase, the appellant entered upon the lands to erect transmission towers and to string electricity cables across the two lots of land. The respondent claimed that it had suffered losses and filed a claim <i>inter alia</i> for trespass which the High Court allowed. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, claiming that it had the right of way.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the appellant had previously entered upon the lands and the impugned entry was not an entry but a re-entry. There was no evidence of abandonment of the right of way and there was no evidence that the right of way had been revoked. Without proving that the appellant's old transmission lines in existence were in fact trespassing on the lands, their existence together with the absence of evidence of revocation of the right was <i>ipso facto</i> proof of the right of way for re-entry.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The defendant Tenaga Nasional Berhad (the appellant) appealed against the decision of the High Court to allow the claim by the plaintiff Keyaki Corporation Sdn Bhd (the respondent).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent's case was that upon an invitation sometime in December 1995, the respondent on 25 November 1996 entered into a contract to purchase two vacant lots of adjoining land in Mukim Bakri in the town of Muar, namely EMR 1954 Lot 2450 (also known as Lot 5033) and GM 69 Lot 5184. At the time of purchase, there was neither electricity transmission lines nor electricity transmission towers on the two lots of land. There was also no endorsement at all on the Register Documents of Title. But subsequent to its purchase, it found the appellant entering upon its land to erect massive electricity transmission towers and subsequently the stringing of huge electricity cables overhead across the two lots of land. Evidence to this effect was adduced for the respondent through its 1<sup>st</sup> witness and Director, Mr Hau Swee Tun (SP1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondent's claim was summed up at para 1.9 of the written submissions on its behalf:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant's third witness Megat Kamil Azman bin Megat Ruskamarani (SD3) confirmed that works to dismantle an old electricity transmission line from Sungai Abong substation to Kluang substation commenced in July 1995, and as at November 1995, the dismantling of old electricity transmission line across the two lots of land had been completed. The new transmission line was completed only in year 1997.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The fact matrix in this case is that the appellant, who had a right of way, which it failed to have registered on the title for its transmission lines, had removed the said transmission lines, and before the appellant re-entered the lands to exercise its right of way, the respondent had purchased the two adjoining lands with no knowledge of the right of way.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The respondent relied upon <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_3_27;"><i>Teobros Development Sdn Bhd v. Tenaga Nasional Bhd</i> [2007] 3 MLRH 27</LINK>; [2007] 7 MLJ 67; [2007] 9 CLJ 775 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_565;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad v. Teobros Development Sdn Bhd</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 565</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 391. The Court of Appeal, in <i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad v. Teobros Development Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, referred to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2006_3_458;"><i>Cekal Berjasa Sdn Bhd v. Tenaga Nasional Bhd</i> [2006] 3 MLRH 458</LINK>; [2006] 4 MLJ 284; [2006] 8 CLJ 69; [2003] 1 AMR 553, a case where Tenaga Nasional Berhad had issued a letter stating that they have cancelled their plan to enter the land even though they have obtained an order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(7) of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 (the Act)</LINK> years earlier. There was a clear case of abandonment. In <i>Teobros Development Sdn Bhd v. Tenaga Nasional Berhad</i>, the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that the right obtained under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(7)</LINK> is not a permanent right but temporary and revocable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Before us, it was submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_18;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Bhd v. Dolomite Industrial Park Sdn Bhd</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 18</LINK>; [2000] 2 MLJ 133; [2000] 1 CLJ 695; [2000] 1 AMR 1187, there was a clear finding of failure to prove rights to enter the land. In this case, the appellant had previously entered upon the land, and the impugned entry is not an entry but a re-entry. There was no evidence of abandonment of the right of way as in <i>Cekal Berjasa Sdn Bhd v. Tenaga Nasional Bhd (supra)</i>. <i>Tenaga Nasional Bhd v. Dolomite Industrial Park Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> is therefore distinguishable. Further, there was no evidence that the right of way had been revoked. Without proving that the appellant's old transmission lines in existence were in fact trespassing on the lands, their existence together with the absence of evidence of revocation of the right, is in our view, <i>ipso facto</i> proof of the right of way for re-entry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Act provides that the right of way under the Act attracts under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16</LINK> the assessment of compensation. The respondent's action however was for trespass and sought injunction for the appellant to quit and remove all posts and pylons, general and special damages to be assessed, interest and costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant's defence was that it had the right of way. It therefore had no obligation to bring the previous owner, the sole party to have received a monetary benefit, as a party. The respondent had apparently elected not to bring in as a party and seek remedy against the previous owner. We, therefore, leave this aspect alone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we allowed the appeal, set aside the orders of the High Court, fixed costs in the sum of RM20,000.00 here and below, and ordered that the deposit be refunded.</p>
