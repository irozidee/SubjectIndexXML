    <p>The appellant was the registered proprietor of a piece of land ("the land"). He charged the land to the respondent as security for a loan taken by a third party. The land was held under a Land Office title. The third party defaulted and the respondent applied to the Land Administrator for the sale of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;260.;;">s 260 of the National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK>. The Land Administrator held an inquiry but did not make any order for sale. Instead, purporting to act under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265(3A) of the NLC</LINK>, the Land Administrator referred the application to the High Court. The Land Administrator did so because the appellant had disagreed with the reserve price proposed by the respondent. The High Court, purporting to act under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265(3A) of the NLC</LINK>, made an order for sale. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. In the Court of Appeal, the appellant submitted that since there were no two unsuccessful auctions before the Land Administrator carried out pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsections (1), (2) and (3) of s 265 of the NLC</LINK>, the Land Administrator had no power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265(3A) of the NLC</LINK> to refer the application to the High Court. Further, since the High Court had no power to make the order for sale, the purported order for sale by the High Court was a nullity.</p>

      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal concerns a question of law: Whether a Land Administrator has the power pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A) of s 265 of the National Land Code ('the NLC')</LINK> to refer an application for sale, made to the Land Administrator pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;260.;;">s 260 of the NLC</LINK>, to the High Court, without previously having carried out a sale of the subject land at the Land Office twice pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsections (1), (2) and (3) of s 265 of the National Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">Section 265</LINK> states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant was the registered proprietor of the subject land. The subject land was charged to the respondent bank on 17 February 1996 as security for a loan taken by a third party. The third party defaulted on the loan. As the subject land was held under a Land Office title, the respondent on 28 March 2006 proceeded to apply to the Land Administrator for the sale of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;260.;;">s 260 of the NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It is not disputed that an inquiry was held before the Land Administrator on various dates (the last date being 20 December 2011), but the Land Administrator did not make any order for sale in respect of the subject land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;263.;;">s 263 of the NLC</LINK>. Instead, purporting to act under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265(3A) of the NLC</LINK>, the Land Administrator 'referred' the application to the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In the case before us the Land Administrator purported to refer the application to the High Court via his letter dated 2 January 2012 because (according to para 3 of the letter) the appellant/chargor had disagreed with the reserved price as proposed by the respondent/chargee, and had applied that the matter be referred to the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The High Court purporting to act under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265(3A)</LINK> made an order for sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Before us the appellant submitted that, since there were no two unsuccessful auctions before the Land Administrator carried out pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsections (1), (2) and (3) of s 265 of the NLC</LINK>, the Land Administrator had no power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A) of s 265</LINK> to refer the application to the High Court. Since the purported reference to the High Court was an invalid reference, a nullity, it follows then that the High Court had no power to make the order for sale; and that the purported order for sale by the High Court was a nullity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondent's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The respondent, on the other hand, takes the position that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A) of s 265</LINK> was inserted via an amendment to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265</LINK> and the purpose of this amendment is to confer power to the Land Administrator to refer any application for sale to the High Court regardless of whether or not there had been prior unsuccessful sale (or sales) before the Land Administrator. In support of its argument, the learned counsel for the respondent refers to para 30 of the <i>Explanatory Statement to the National Land Code (Amendment) Bill 2000</i> which states:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned High Court Judge takes the view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A) of s 265</LINK> must be read independently of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsections (2) and (3)</LINK> of the same; and that this must be the intention of Parliament when it amended <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265 via the National Land Code (Amendment) Act 2001 (Act A1104)</LINK> that came into force on 1 December 2001 by deleting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3)(c) of that section</LINK> and introduced <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK>.</p>

      <b>The Appeal</b>

      <b>[11]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court, the appellant/defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Prior to the amendment of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3) of s 265</LINK>, the subsection reads:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 26 May 2014 we allowed the appellant's/defendant's appeal with costs. We set aside the Order of the High Court as well as the decision of the Land Administrator to refer the matter to the High Court.We order that the matter be sent back to the Land Administrator to carry out a proper inquiry in accordance with the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;261.;;">s 261 of the NLC</LINK> and to make the appropriate decision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;253.;;">s 263</LINK> of the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Reasons</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> With respect, we are unable to agree with the interpretation as adopted by the learned High Court Judge that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A) of s 265</LINK> should be read independently of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsections (2) and (3) of the same</LINK>; and that the High Court has the power to make an order for sale under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK>, provided there was a reference to the High Court by the Land Administrator, even where there had been no two previous unsuccessful sales (in the sense of there being no bidders). If <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK> were to be read independently of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsections (2) and (3)</LINK>, as ruled by the learned High Court Judge, then how does one explain the meaning of the words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>in the present <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3)</LINK>? These words will only make sense if we were to read them together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK>. We are of the view that it is clear that, with the introduction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK>, the position does not change: there still must have been two prior unsuccessful sales by the Land Administrator before he can lawfully refer the matter to the High Court. What the amendment now makes clear - and this is via a proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK> - is that the High Court cannot, in exercising its power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK>, that is to say, in dealing with the reference, make an order to direct the Land Administrator to carry out a sale. Under the pre-amended provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3)</LINK>, it is not made clear as to whether or not the High Court, in dealing with the reference, had the power to make an order directing the Land Administrator to carry out the sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We find that cl 30 of the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, as referred to by the learned counsel for the respondent, is of no assistance to the construction of either the amended <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;3.;;">subsection (3) </LINK>or the new <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK>. It does not contain a full and clear explanation as to the purpose of the amendments to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265;;">s 265</LINK>, and this is unfortunate. With respect to the Parliamentary Draftsman, we view the clause as a mere lip service effort to explain the purposes of the amendments; of little utility; and, significantly, cl 30 had omitted to even mention (let alone to explain the purpose of), among others, the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">subsection (3A)</LINK>.</p>
