    <p>The issue before the court was on the competency of the Public Prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal and discharge of the 1st and 4th respondents under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> read together with s 34 of the same, and against an amended charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> of the same against the 2nd and 3rd respondents. This court had earlier dismissed the appeal against the acquittal and discharge of the 1st and 4th respondents as they had gone missing after they were acquitted and discharged and were not traceable. The appeal herein was in relation to the amended charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> against the 2nd and 3rd respondents who had been ordered to enter their defence by the learned judge after the close of the prosecution case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> This appeal was incompetent, as the ruling made by the learned judge in calling the 2nd and 3rd respondents to enter their defence on the amended charge did not constitute a final order and was hence not appealable. The said ruling did not fall within the meaning of "decision" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;3.;;">s 3 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. The appeal ought to be struck off and the case remitted to the High Court for continuation of the hearing of the said respondents' defence. (paras 16 &amp; 20)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Balia Yusof Wahi JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The four respondents were charged with the murder of one Zakaria bin Mahda under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the same Code</LINK>. The 3rd respondent, Ijau Anak Pengarah also faced another charge of causing hurt to one Manyie Anak Kassim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;324.;;">s 324 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The offences were allegedly committed at about 11.00pm on 25 September 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the close of the case for the prosecution, the learned trial judge found no <i>prima facie</i> case had been established against the 1st and 4th respondents on the murder charge and accordingly made an order of acquittal and discharge on the two.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> As for the 2nd and 3rd respondents the learned trial judge also found the prosecution to have failed in proving a <i>prima facie</i> case of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK>. However, Her Ladyship found that a <i>prima facie</i> case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Code</LINK> had been established. Accordingly the charge against the two respondents were amended to one under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As for the second charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;324.;;">s 324</LINK> against the 3rd respondent, the learned trial judge also found a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established and ordered the 3rd respondent to enter his defence on the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Having made the ruling, the case was adjourned to another date for continuation of the trial against the 2nd and 3rd respondents on the amended charge after the duo had claimed trial on the amended charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On the day of the continued trial, the learned DPP applied for an adjournment on the ground that an appeal had been lodged in the Court of Appeal against the order of acquittal and discharge on the 1st and 4th respondents and also against the reduction of the charge to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> against the 2nd and 3rd respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Learned counsel for the 3rd respondent, in the person of Mr Augustine Liong objected to the adjournment asserting that the case against the 2nd and 3rd respondents should proceed as the ruling of the court calling on them to enter their defence on the amended charge does not constitute a final order. The court should proceed to hear their defence. He further submitted that any dissatisfaction on the part of the Public Prosecutor against the said ruling may be brought up by filing an appeal at the end of the case. Learned counsel for the 2nd respondent said nothing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In allowing the adjournment, this is what the learned High Court Judge said at pp 415-416 of Rekod Rayuan Jilid 4:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The notice of appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Clearly, the appeal by the Public Prosecutor is against the order of acquittal and discharge of the 1st and 4th respondents and the amendment of the charge against the 2nd and 3rd respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> What follows next is rather interesting and raises an issue of law of some importance and which had been recurring in the courts below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> When this appeal was fixed for hearing before us, that was not the first time. It was for the third time and we realised that the appeal against the acquittal and discharge of the 1st and 4th respondents had earlier been struck out by this court for non-availability of the said two respondents. They had gone missing since the order of acquittal and discharge and had been untraceable. What remained before us was the prosecutor's appeal against the learned trial judge's order of amending the charge to one under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK> and ordering the 2nd and 3rd respondents to enter their defence on the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The issue before us is simply whether the appeal is competent. We posed the question to the learned deputy and the learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents as a preliminary issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Having heard their views, we unanimously struck out the appeal and made a further order that the case be remitted to the High Court for the same trial judge to hear the defence of the two respondents on the amended charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We now give our reasons for so ordering.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In our judgment, this appeal is incompetent. As rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the 3rd respondent in the court below, the ruling made by the learned High Court Judge in respect of calling the 2nd and 3rd respondents to enter their defence on the amended charge does not constitute a final order and was thus not appealable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;50.;;">Section 50 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (CJA)</LINK> provides the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear and determine any appeals against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction and in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction in respect of any criminal matter decided by the Sessions Court and on only questions of law in respect of criminal matter decided by a Magistrate's Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_11_446;"><i>Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim lwn. PP</i> [2009] 11 MLRH 446</LINK>, the Federal Court considered <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;3.;;">s 3 of the CJA</LINK> which defines the meaning of 'decision' used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;50.;;">s 50 of the same Act</LINK>. "Decision" under the said section means judgment, sentence or order, but does not include any ruling made in the course of a trial or hearing of any cause or matter which does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In <i>Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim case (supra)</i> the trial judge had dismissed an application by counsel of the appellant for a statement of the complainant in the case (PW1) recorded under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> to be produced for examination by the appellant. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, it was ruled that the ruling by the trial judge is not appealable as it does not fall within the meaning of 'decision' under s 3 of CJA. On a further appeal to the Federal Court, it was ruled that the decision was not appealable because it is a decision or ruling made in the course of trial or hearing which does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Likewise in the instant appeal, the decision of the learned trial judge in amending the charge and calling for the 2nd and 3rd respondents to enter their defence on the said amended charge is not a decision within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;3.;;">s 3 of the CJA</LINK>. That decision, is in our judgment not appealable. Hence, the appeal ought to be struck off and the case remitted to the High Court for continuation of the hearing of the respondents' defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In the unreported case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2014_498;"><i>PP v. Hii Tiong Hsia &amp; Anor</i> [2014] MLRAU 498</LINK>; [2015] 2 AMR 673, an appeal was filed by the Public Prosecutor against the decision of the High Court in reducing the charge against the 3rd and 6th accused from a charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> of the same code to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Code</LINK> at the close of the prosecutor's case. Altogether six accused persons were jointly charged in the case but four of them were acquitted and discharged at the close of the prosecution case. No appeal was filed against the acquittal of the four accused persons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The Court of Appeal went on to hear the appeal on the issue whether the prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against the two respondents at the end of the prosecution case. The court ruled that the trial judge had the power to do what he did in the case that is to amend the charge to a lesser offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The court went further and stated that the more important issue in the appeal was whether the decision or ruling of the learned High Court Judge is appealable at all and ruled that the appeal was premature. The Court of Appeal further opined that "once the court alters or adds a charge (which in our view include an amendment to the charge), the trial should proceed immediately on the amended or added charges, unless for some reasons the court considers that to proceed immediately with the trial will prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecution in the conduct of the case" (see para 21 of the judgment).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The prosecutor's appeal was dismissed on the ground that the decision or ruling of the High Court Judge was not appealable because it was a decision or ruling made in the course of trial or hearing which does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties, also relying on the authority of <i>Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim lwn. PP (supra)</i>. The order of the High Court amending the charge to a lesser offence and calling upon the respondents to enter defence on the said amended charge was affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In disposing the instant appeal before us, we have taken the liberty of not hearing the appeal on its merits but we summarily struck it off upon deciding on the preliminary issue of the competency of the appeal, namely whether the decision or ruling is appealable at all? We say it is not, and make an order accordingly for the case to be remitted to the High Court for the same High Court Judge to hear the defence on the amended charge.</p>
