    <p>In the instant case, the accused ("the appellant") appealed against his conviction and sentence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> for the murder of the deceased. At the material time, the appellant had commenced a relationship with one Aramah binti Angian ("PW14"), after PW14 had broken off her relationship with the deceased. Notwithstanding that, the deceased still retained a key to PW14's room ("the said room"). At the time of the incident, the appellant had gone to the said room to negotiate with the deceased and a quarrel occurred in which the deceased was killed. Subsequently, the appellant was tried for murder, whereby the prosecution alleged that the appellant had stabbed the deceased with the intention to cause such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. When called under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC")</LINK> to enter upon his defence, the appellant admitted that he was involved in the quarrel with the deceased; that it was the deceased who started to stab him first; and that the injuries caused by him to the deceased were in self-defence. At the end of the trial, the trial judge found that the matters relied on by the appellant were not sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the appellant's intention to kill the deceased, for inter alia the following reasons: there was no way of ascertaining if the SMS sent to the appellant by the deceased was a death threat ("the said threat") because the defence counsel never questioned PW14 about what the SMS actually said; the earlier fight between the appellant and the deceased did not show any apparent jealously and grudge that could be attributed as a motive for the deceased wanting to kill the appellant; the allegation that the appellant had acted in self-defence which originated from him was a self-exculpatory statement he made to others, which was not supported by any other evidence; the irresistible inference to be drawn from the fact that the appellant had stabbed the deceased multiple times was that he intended to cause such bodily injury to the deceased which was sufficient to cause death; and that the appellant did not, on a balance of probabilities, show that he had acted in private defence. In the instant appeal, the main issues to be considered were, amongst others, whether the High Court was in error when it relied on its belief in accepting the case for the prosecution and rejecting the defence instead of identifying the differing conclusions that could be drawn from the facts and evidence; whether the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the intention to cause death to the deceased; whether the High Court ought to have specifically scrutinised PW14's testimony; and whether the High Court had applied a much higher standard than required by law in considering the appellant's defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Scrutiny of the grounds of judgment of the High Court showed that instead of identifying the differing conclusions that could be drawn from the facts and evidence, the High Court relied on its belief in accepting the case for the prosecution and rejecting the defence. This approach was a serious error. It overlooked that the trial was to examine and test the facts and evidence relied upon as to whether the ingredients constituting the offence charged was proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. In the instant case, the beliefs were founded upon the testimony of PW14, which was not subjected to close scrutiny by the court before it was accepted as safe to be relied upon to support a conviction. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, no effort was made by the prosecution to particularise as to at what point the two fatal injuries were inflicted upon the deceased. Therefore, it was at the very least possible that they were caused in the course of infliction of injuries in self-defence and with no intention to cause death. Hence, the conclusions that could be drawn as to intention of the appellant were not necessarily irresistible but remained equivocal. All that was proved was a high probability that the appellant had intention to cause death. Accordingly, the more liberal conclusion ought to be drawn in favour of the appellant to hold that the prosecution had failed to prove its case as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180 of the CPC</LINK>, and the appellant ought not to have been called to enter upon his defence. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court failed to consider whether all the abrasions, bruises and incised wounds and other stab wounds were evidence of a fight with no intention to cause death or an attack with an intention to cause death. Without such evidence, what remained before the High Court was evidence of injuries inflicted, two of which were capable of causing death, which was as much evidence of self-defence as it was of an attack by the appellant. Since there were two or more possible conclusions, the High Court could not have concluded there was an intention to cause death or such bodily injury sufficient to cause death. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In regard to the High Court's failure to scrutinise PW14's testimony, its reasoning to dismiss the said threat was flawed. It was not for the defence counsel but rather for the prosecution to ask the question of what the SMS which contained the said threat actually said. Further, the absence of any evidence to suggest that the deceased had done anything to carry out the said threat was also not a reason to dismiss the allegation of a fight between the appellant and the deceased. Similarly, the allegation of jealousy and grudge which was attributed as a motive for the deceased wanting to kill the accused should not have been dismissed, due to the fact that the appellant still had a key to the said room and the fact that both the appellant and the deceased were still seeing PW14. Accordingly, as the testimony of PW14 was the basis of beliefs resulting in conviction and sentence of the appellant, it ought to have been scrutinised specifically as to whether it was safe to rely upon. (paras 27, 30, 31, 32 &amp; 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> It was clear that the High Court had treated self-defence and private defence as interchangeable. The defence of private defence required proof upon a balance of probabilities (Wong Teck Chong v. PP (refd)). However, the High Court overlooked that what was being considered was the defence, not prosecution; and the defence case was of acting solely in self-defence, thereby negating formation of any intention to cause death or bodily injury, which only required a reasonable doubt to be established and not proof upon a balance of probabilities. Hence, the High Court had applied a much higher standard than required by law. The consideration ought to have been whether the appellant's defence was not merely possible but was also not in the least probable. (paras 38-39)</p>

      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The accused Ommar bin Yacob ("the appellant") appealed against his conviction and sentence to the mandatory sentence of death under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> on a charge of the murder of one Jully bin Martin, ("the deceased") between 1.00pm and 3.00pm on 12 May 2007 at Room No 10, 2nd Floor, Lot 34, Lorong 4, Bandaran Berjaya, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah (Room No 10).</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The core of the prosecution case, extracted from the submissions for the respondent ("RWS") before us is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It was submitted for the respondent that after the appellant told PW14 that the deceased was at Room No 10 (RWS para 11):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The part that PW14 and the deceased's sister Mary went back to PW14's room, where the police has arrived and began investigation, is not quite correct. The prosecution evidence through PW14 at RR1:198 line 1ff:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Little turns upon the inaccuracy, but any inaccuracy is undesirable in a criminal case as it can distort and lead astray the cause of justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant had at about 2.30pm the same day sought medical treatment at PW7's clinic at Ground Floor, Jalan Perpaduan, Kampung Air, Kota Kinabalu for a 1cm longitudinal wound in the mid region of his neck. His DNA was found on the short pants worn by the deceased and a stained cigarette butt as well as in the deceased's nail clippings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> When called under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code ("the CPC")</LINK> to enter upon his defence, the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In respect of the fourth ingredient, the intention to cause such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the primary focus of the defence was self-defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Judgment Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In its grounds of judgment, the High Court addressed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We bear in mind that whether it was the appellant who killed the deceased was not the issue. The issue was whether there was intention to cause such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We take the following excerpts from the grounds of judgment of the High Court to demonstrate not only the matters considered but also the reasoning and findings of the High Court on the question of intention to cause such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The foregoing demonstrates the following.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Judgment On Basis Of Belief</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Scrutiny of the grounds of judgment showed that instead of identifying the differing conclusions that can be drawn from the facts and the evidence and why other conclusions hold no merit, the High Court relied on its belief in accepting the case for the prosecution and rejecting the defence. This approach is a serious error. It overlooks that the trial is to examine and test the facts and evidence relied upon as to whether the ingredients constituting the offence charged is proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution (see s 180 Criminal Procedure Code<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;"></LINK>). The beliefs were founded upon the testimony of PW14. But the evidence of PW14 upon which the belief in the prosecution case, and the rejection of the defence and the finding of intention to cause such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death was based, was not subjected to close scrutiny before accepting it as safe to be relied upon to support a conviction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We address this issue further below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Intention And Private Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is clear the High Court appreciated that the defence of self-defence was raised in relation to the 4th ingredient as to intention. However, the High Court failed to appreciate the distinction between self-defence negating intention and private defence under the Penal Code and treated both terms interchangeably.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In simple terms, the defence is because the appellant was defending himself, it was self-defence and it negates the formation of the necessary mens rea of intention to kill.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> On the other hand, it is provided in the Penal Code that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence [<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;96.;;">s 96</LINK>]. The right of private defence of body and property is provided for by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;97.;;">s 97</LINK>, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;99.;;">s 99</LINK> provides that there is no right of private defence against acts done or attempted to be done by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office which do not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, or upon his direction, where there is time to have recourse to public authorities, or infliction of more harm than is necessary for the purpose of defence. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;100.;;">Section 100</LINK> provides as to when the right of private defence to the voluntary causing of death. For the purposes of this case, it is available when the assault by the other party may reasonably cause the apprehension that death or grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The key distinction made is that the Penal Code provides the defence of private defence for voluntary acts of defence, while the defence in this case is that the acts were acts in selfdefence with no intention to cause death or such bodily injury as the offender:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The defence of no intention to cause death or such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death because of self-defence necessarily implied that the injuries inflicted, even though death was caused, were not intended to cause death. Herein is a further significance of the failure to appreciate the distinction between the right of private defence and self-defence. Private defence requires proof upon a balance of probabilities, while all that is required of the appellant in defending on the 4th ingredient is to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether there was intention to cause death or the requisite bodily injury.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It is true that at the stage of the prosecution case, the only material are the questions put by the defence. They were not conceded or accepted by the witnesses. There was no evidence as would raise a reasonable doubt in favour of the appellant. The questions put merely set the foundation for the appellant to substantiate the lines of defence so disclosed by evidence when called to enter upon his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> But in this case no effort was made by the prosecution to particularise as to at what point, as is consistent with an intention to cause either death or the requisite bodily injury as would cause death, the two fatal injuries from stabbing that penetrated the lungs were inflicted. Without it being established it remains at the very least possible that they were caused in the course of infliction of injuries in self-defence and with no intention to cause death. The fact both were in some form of relationship with PW14 gave both the appellant and the deceased some reason to fight with one another in anger. The conclusions that can be drawn as to intention were not necessarily irresistible but remained equivocal. As to intention to cause death or such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, all that was proved was a high probability of it. In such case, the more liberal conclusion ought to be drawn in favour of the appellant to hold that the prosecution had failed to prove its case as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>, and the appellant ought not to have been called to enter upon his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Failure To Examine The Evidence Critically</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The primary evidence in relation to intention were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Number Of Injuries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The High Court appreciated that of the total of 54 injuries, 12 were abrasions, six were bruises, 18 were incised wounds and only 18 were stab wounds. The High Court held that of the stab wounds, eight were in the upper back of the left chest, five to the left shoulder area and two were on the right arm. It was not appreciated this left three stab wounds unaccounted for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Be that as it may, there were two stab wounds, No 7 on the left front chest and No 10 on the back of his right chest, both penetrating the lungs were both capable in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, as these caused bleeding in the left and right chest cavities and collapse of the lungs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The High Court however took the number of injuries as proof of intention:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The High Court failed to consider whether the 52 abrasions, bruises and incised wounds and other stab wounds evidence a fight with no intention to cause death or such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death or an attack with an intention to cause death or such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Without such evidence, what remained before the High Court is evidence of 54 injuries inflicted, two of which are capable of causing death, which is as much evidence of self-defence as it is of an attack by the appellant. Since where there are two or more possible conclusions, the conclusion the more favourable is to be given, it is plain that they were considered and the High Court could not have concluded there was an intention to cause death or such bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Testimony Of PW14</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The testimony of PW14 was the basis of beliefs resulting in conviction and sentence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The High Court failed to scrutinise her testimony:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The grounds of judgment reflected the defence submission as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The High Court reasoned in respect of a death threat as follows [see Judgment p 17 line 13-22]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In our view, the reasoning to dismiss PW14's reply in cross-examination where she agreed that a SMS sent to the accused by the deceased contained a death threat, is flawed. The answer is not diminished because defence counsel put it in cross-examination. We asked ourselves when else could he ask the question to PW14. Having obtained that answer, it was not for defence counsel but it is for the prosecution to ask the question what the SMS actually said.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Nor can the absence of any evidence to suggest that Jully had done anything between January 2007 and May 2007 to carry out his alleged threat between a fight four months earlier on 18 January 2007 be a reason to dismiss the allegation of a fight, particularly since this part of the reasoning was at the prosecution stage, and before the appellant had opportunity to adduce his own evidence. This was not only placing the burden upon the accused, but expecting evidence from him before the defence was called.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Similarly, it is difficult to follow the reasoning not to give credence to the allegation put of jealousy and grudge which was attributed as a motive for Jully wanting to kill the accused on the grounds given by the High Court that Jully still had a key to PW14's room. In our view, that he still had a key leads to the inference that the relationship is not over but still continues and the arrival of the appellant, therefore discovery the appellant was still coming to PW14's room, was reason for a fight. There is no evidence that Jully had come to terms with PW14 seeing both him and the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> For these reasons, the testimony of PW14 ought to have been scrutinised specifically as to whether it was safe to rely upon it. This, the High Court overlooked but went directly to accepting her testimony at face value.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In concluding its reasoning on whether the prosecution had proved a prima facie case, the High Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> If the above means that if an allegation of facts in one's defence comes from the accused it is discounted, and discounted also because it is self-exculpatory, this is thoroughly contrary to well established authority and a cornerstone of the criminal law that the evaluation is whether a reasonable doubt has been raised. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337. Though these cases dealt evaluation at the end of the defence case, the principle applies for the season that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180(4) of the Criminal Procedure</LINK> Code which defines a prima facie case where the prosecution has adduced credible evidence proving each ingredient of the offence which if unrebutted or unexplained would warrant a conviction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In our view, the errors made the conclusions unsafe as a basis to call the appellant to enter upon his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> For completeness, we address the rejection of the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The appellant testified on oath. The High Court summed up his testimony fairly and at some length between pp 23 and 30 of the judgment. At the top of p 31 of the judgment, it is clear that the High Court had treated self-defence and private defence as interchangeable. The defence of private defence requires proof upon a balance of probabilities (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_561;"><i>Wong Teck Choy v. PP</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 561</LINK>; [2005] 4 MLJ 693; [2005] 3 CLJ 431; [2005] 4 AMR 570. The error is in considering that burden as not a heavy one. It is true that proof upon a balance of probabilities is not a heavy one when compared to proof beyond reasonable doubt. What appears overlooked however that what is being considered is the defence, not prosecution; and (b) the defence case is of acting solely in self-defence, thereby negating formation of any intention to cause death or causing such bodily injury as is likely in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, requires only a reasonable doubt to be established.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We conclude that the High Court had applied a much higher standard than required by law, and failed to follow established case law that what is to be considered is whether the defence established a reasonable doubt, and not whether one believes it or not. The consideration ought to be whether the appellant's defence is not merely possible but is also not in the least probable (See <i>Miller v. Minister of Pensions</i> [1947] 2 All ER 372, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_28;"><i>Tan Boon Kean v.

    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The error is evident at p 33 line 19 of the judgment, where the High Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Since the High Court did not consider the correct issue, it is unnecessary to deal with the reasons given and is redundant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> On this error also, the appeal ought to have been allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence by the High Court.</p>
