    <p>The appellant had engaged the respondents to construct a factory for RM2.2m pursuant to a construction agreement ("agreement") dated 18 December 2009. The agreement provided inter alia, that claims for variations or additional works would not be allowed without the express written instruction or order from the appellant. All such variations had to be certified in writing by the appellant. The agreement also prescribed a penalty of RM1,000 per day for delays in completing the factory. A supplementary agreement was subsequently executed between the parties due to the appellant failing to hand-over the construction site and to increase the construction price of RM2.2m to RM2.3m. On or about 11 March 2011, the respondents received a notice to stop work in a particular area as the appellant's engineer ("engineer") claimed that a certain protrusion was supposed to be 600mm and not 450mm as constructed by the respondents. On 14 March 2011, the respondents wrote to the appellant stating that they had constructed the protrusion in accordance with the drawings given to them and also requested a written instruction from the engineer. The respondents further stated that the amendment sought to the building of the protrusion was to be regarded as a variation to the agreement. The engineer wrote to the respondents on 15 March 2011 attaching the drawing for the 600mm protrusion and instructing the respondents to construct as per the drawing. The engineer also stated by letter dated 24 March 2011 that if the respondents was of the view that the construction of the 600mm protrusion was a variation, the appellant was to obtain a contract variation before proceeding to work. The respondents in response sent two quotations amounting to RM31,810.73 to the respondents but received no response. On 23 May 2011 the appellant's engineer offered to pay the respondents a sum of RM10,000 instead but which sum was rejected by the respondents. The respondents thus purported to terminate the agreement and sued to recover compensation for work done and loss of profits. The appellant in response counterclaimed for compensation for 82 days of delay and for the amount paid to a new contractor to complete the construction works. The High Court sustained the respondents' termination and found the respondents' claim proved, but dismissed the appellant's counterclaim for lack of evidence. Hence, the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal in respect of the respondents' claim; allowing in part the appellant's counterclaim:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The right to terminate an agreement will only crytallise when there is a fundamental breach of the agreement. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the refusal by the appellant to agree to the respondents' quotation for the variation works could not be said to be a breach going to the root of the construction agreement. The trial judge had placed too much emphasis on cl 6 on the need for a written confirmation by the appellant for the respondents to proceed with the variation works for the protrusion. Clause 6 was but one condition of many conditions contained in the construction agreement and it only related to the manner in which variation works were be regulated. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was no evidence that the respondents could not complete the construction agreement save and except for the two variations relating to the protrusion. There was no dispute that the lengthening of the protrusion was variation work in view of the offer of RM10,000 by the appellant's engineer. The only dispute between the parties was the consideration or costs of the variation work on the protrusion. The dispute of pricing for variation work could not be a ground for the respondents to terminate. The termination by the respondents was thus invalid. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> With regard to the appellant's counterclaim, except for the claim of RM82,000 for delay, the appellant had not proved its case for the amount claimed in that there was no evidence for the court to rely on. (para 23)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>

    <p>
      <b>David Wong Dak Wah JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court in which the learned judge allowed the respondents/plaintiffs' claim of RM629,465.50 being damages suffered and dismissed the appellant/defendant's counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard the appeal and after due consideration to respective submissions of counsel, we allowed the appeal and now give our reasons for the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant had engaged the respondents to construct four storey factory (factory) in Shah Alam for an agreed sum of RM2.2 million. This engagement was pursuant to a construction agreement dated 18 December 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The completion of the construction of the factory is agreed to be on or before 16 August 2010 with a delay penalty of RM1,000.00 per day imposed on the respondents. However this construction agreement was superseded by a supplementary agreement in view of the fact that the appellant failed to deliver the construction site.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The supplementary agreement is dated 11 May 2010 and was entered for the purpose of increasing the agreed price of RM2.2 million to RM2.3 million and extending the completion period to 10 March 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On or about 11 March 2011, the respondents received a notice to stop work for the area above the staircase as the cantilever fascia beam was not constructed in accordance with the construction drawings. According to the appellant's engineer's letter, the protrusion's height was supposed to be 600mm and not 450mm as constructed by the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In response to the engineer's letter, the respondents, on 14 March 2011 wrote to the appellant and copied to the engineer, and stated that what they had constructed was in accordance with the drawings given to them and further requested a written instruction to carry out the instruction as required by the engineer. The respondents on the same day also wrote another letter and stated that the stoppage was due to amendment to the drawings, hence holding that they would not be responsible for any delay or additional costs. Further the respondents stated that this requested amendment was to be regarded as a variation to the construction agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The respondents received no replies but instead received two letters from the engineer dated 15 March 2011 and 24 March 2011. In the former letter, the engineer attached the 600mm protrusion drawing and instructed the respondents to construct as per the attached drawings. In the latter letter, the engineer's instruction was to rectify the staircase accordingly with a further note to say that if the respondents was of the view that construction of the 600mm was a variation to the construction agreement then the respondents was to obtain a contract variation before proceeding to work.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In response to the engineer's letter dated 24 March 2011, the respondents sent two quotations amounting to RM31,810.73 to the appellant on 29 March 2011. However there was no response by the appellant prompting the respondents to write another letter dated 29 April 2011 to the appellant stating as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> No reply was given by the appellant to that letter, hence prompting the appellant to write two further letters dated 13 May 2011 and 20 May 2011. The letter dated 20 May reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 23 May 2011, the appellant's engineer offered to pay the respondents a sum of RM10,000.00 which the respondents rejected in a letter dated 1 June 2011 which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant disputed the validity of the termination and fixed 23 June 2011 for valuation of the work done by the respondents as at 1 June 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The respondents then filed in this suit claiming for the followings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant in response to the respondents' suit filed a counterclaim as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned judge in our view correctly set out three issues for her determination and they are these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned judge sustained the respondents' termination and she relied on cl 6 of the construction agreement which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Premised on that cl 6 the learned judge sustained the respondents' termination and her rationale is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> She then found the respondents' claims to have been proved and gave judgment on terms as claimed. As for the counterclaim by the appellant, it was dismissed for lack of evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Grounds Of Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The law on the right of innocent party to terminate an agreement is fairly established and that is only when there is breach in the nature of a fundamental breach of the agreement that the right to terminate will crystallise. This court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_69;"><i>Ching Yik Development Sdn Bhd v. Setapak Heights Development Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 69</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 675; [1997] 1 CLJ 287; [1997] 1 AMR 89 has held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Can we say that the refusal by the appellant to agree to the respondents' quotation for the variation works for the protrusion amount to a breach going to the root of the construction agreement? That quotation price amounted to RM31,810.73 and when you compare that to the agreed construction price of RM2.3 million, it cannot be said that the alleged breach of the appellant was a breach going to the root of the construction agreement. With respect to the learned judge, she had placed too much emphasis on cl 6 on the need for a written confirmation by the appellant for the respondents to proceed with the variation works for the protrusion. Clause 6 is but one condition of many conditions contained in the construction agreement and it only relates to the manner in which variation works are be regulated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Further there is no evidence before us that the respondents could not complete the construction agreement save and except for the two variations relating to the protrusion. In our view, there is no dispute that the lengthening of the protrusion is variation works in view of the offer of RM10,000.00 by the appellant's engineer. That being the case, the only dispute between the parties was the consideration or costs of the variation works on the protrusion. This dispute of pricing for variation works cannot be a ground for the respondents to terminate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Accordingly, we find that the termination by the respondents was invalid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> As for the counterclaim, except for the claim of RM82,000.00 for delay, we are in agreement with the learned judge with her grounds that the appellant had not proved its case for the amount claimed in that there was no evidence before the court to rely on.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> For reasons stated above, in respect of the respondents' claims, we allowed the appeal and as for the counterclaim we allowed only in part in that the appellant is entitled to judgment in the sum of RM82,000.00 with statutory interests of 5% per annum from the date of judgment of the High Court until full payment of the same. Consequently, the orders of the High Court in respect of the respondents' claims are set aside and in respect of the appellant's counterclaim, the orders of the High Court are affirmed except for the claim of RM82,000.00. We further award costs in the sum of RM40,000.00 for here and below to the appellant. We also ordered the deposits to be refunded to the respective parties.</p>
