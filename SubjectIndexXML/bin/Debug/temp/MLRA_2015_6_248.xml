    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the plaintiff's appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal that reversed the judgment of the High Court. The defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment on the ground of alleged misconduct committed by the plaintiff. In the High Court, the defendant was found to be in breach of the rules of natural justice by not giving the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard when it did not hold a hearing. Further, the High Court decided that reg 28 of the Peraturan-Peraturan Pegawai Lembaga Pertubuhan Peladang (Kelakuan dan Tatatertib) 1994 ('the Disciplinary Rules') must be interpreted <i>vis-a-vis</i> reg 25 and found that the defendant failed to comply with the said regulations. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the defendant's appeal and held that reg 25(1) of the Disciplinary Rules had been complied with by the defendant. In this appeal, the fundamental question was whether the Investigation Committee pursuant to reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules had been established by the Disciplinary Committee for the purpose of obtaining further clarification. On the other hand, the defendant submitted that the approach taken by the plaintiff in the present appeal differed entirely from his pleaded claim, as the plaintiff's pleaded case was about the non-application of reg 28 of the Disciplinary Rules, whereas the plaintiff's position in this appeal was that an Investigation Committee under reg 28 was established and that he was not called upon to attend it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the plaintiff's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Parties to an action are bound by their own pleadings. Therefore, the court was also bound by the pleadings in as much as the parties themselves. In the instant case, the factual assertion made by the defendant in paras 8.1 and 8.2 in its statement of defence was responded to by way of a general traverse in the plaintiff's statement of reply when he averred that except where previously admitted, the plaintiff denied each and every allegation contained in the defendant's statement of defence. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;SN13.;;">O 18 r 13 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>, a traverse operated to deny an allegation of fact. As a matter of broad general principle, the effect of a general traverse was to deny each and every factual allegation raised by the opposing party. In the result, the obvious consequence of the general traverse contained in para 5 of the plaintiff's statement of reply was to deny the defendant's factual allegation that an Investigation Committee was in fact established which was in direct contradiction of its present contention that an Investigation Committee was in fact formed under reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules. (paras 41, 43, 45, 46 &amp; 47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was upon the plaintiff himself, and certainly not the defendant, to discharge the overall burden of proving his case and satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that his claim as pleaded in the statement of claim was well founded. Here, the plaintiff did not admit paras 8.1 and 8.2 of the statement of defence to support his contention that an Investigation Committee was in fact established and that he was not called for the hearing. Instead, the tenor and thrust of the plaintiff's statement of reply was a total rejection of the defendant's factual averments. The defendant's averments in paras 8.1 and 8.2 of the statement of defence ultimately had no bearing on the plaintiff's case. The plaintiff's pleaded case was his dissatisfaction with the non-formation of the Investigation Committee. However, the plaintiff in this appeal was trying to argue something quite different from his pleaded case without even the support of evidence. Consequently, there was no necessity to answer the question as framed. (paras 48-51)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Azahar Mohamed FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that reversed the judgment of the High Court. The appeal arises from an action brought by the appellant, Saiman Umar in the High Court against the respondent, Lembaga Pertubuhan Peladang based on the cause of action of unlawful dismissal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We shall be referring to parties in this judgment as they were in the High Court, namely the appellant as the plaintiff and the respondent as the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The defendant is a body corporate established under the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_110;;">Farmers' Organization Authority Act 1973 (the Act)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The defendant from 28 December 1973 until 1 March 2002 employed the plaintiff. The plaintiff started his employment with the defendant as a clerk. At the time of his dismissal, that is to say on 1 March 2002, the plaintiff held the post of Assistant Officer of Economics Affairs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 11 July 2000, the defendant initiated a disciplinary action against the plaintiff by issuing a show cause letter dated 21 June 2000 to him. It was alleged that the plaintiff had borrowed a sum of RM40,000.00 from a contractor, one Madzlan bin Abd Rahman (Madzlan) on 21 May 1990 while the plaintiff was holding the post of Pengurus Besar Pertubuhan Peladang Kawasan Mersing Utara-Endau, Johor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In the same show cause letter, the defendant formulated two charges against the plaintiff pursuant to reg 28 of the Peraturan-Peraturan Pegawai Lembaga Pertubuhan Peladang (Kelakuan dan Tatatertib) 1994 (the Disciplinary Rules). The first charge was for behaving in a way that would raise suspicions that the plaintiff was using his official position for his own benefit pursuant to regs 4(2)(c)(ii), (d) and (f) of the Disciplinary Rules. The second charge was for putting the plaintiff in a position of financial obligation with someone who had official business with the defendant pursuant to regs 10(1)(a) and 12(1)(b) of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> By a letter dated 28 July 2000, the plaintiff requested for documents to enable him to prepare his representation since the alleged misconduct happened ten years earlier. The defendant by a letter dated 7 August 2000 asked the plaintiff to specify the documents, which he required. By a letter dated 8 August 2000, the plaintiff specified the documents, which he required to prepare his representation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> By a letter dated 24 August 2000, the defendant turned down the request of the plaintiff on the ground that the documents requested by him were not relevant to the charges and the plaintiff was instructed to put in his representation letter within 14 days.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> By a letter dated 9 September 2000, the plaintiff made his representation to the show cause letter. The plaintiff denied borrowing or receiving RM40,000.00 as a loan from Madzlan in answer to the two charges. Together with his representation letter, the plaintiff enclosed a letter allegedly written by Madzlan dated 6 September 2000 and a statutory declaration by Madzlan denying that he had lent the plaintiff the said sum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The defendant's Disciplinary Committee informed the plaintiff by a letter dated 17 May 2001 that they had considered his representation and found him guilty of both charges. In the same letter, the plaintiff was given a right to mitigate within 21 days.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 31 May 2001, the plaintiff replied by stating that he was not satisfied with the Disciplinary Committee's decision and requested that the decision be reviewed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 25 February 2002, the defendant's Disciplinary Committee informed the plaintiff that after having reviewed and deliberated on the plaintiff's appeal, they decided the plaintiff failed to exculpate himself. The plaintiff was also informed about his dismissal from service with effect from 1 March 2002. In the same letter, the plaintiff was also informed that he could appeal to the Disciplinary Appeal Board within 14 days.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The plaintiff appealed against the decision to the defendant's Disciplinary Appeal Board on the ground that a hearing was supposed to be held before the decision was passed and he was not given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and scrutinise the related documents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> By a letter dated 18 November 2002, the Disciplinary Appeal Board informed the plaintiff that the Disciplinary Appeal Board had on 8 November 2002 affirmed the decision of the Disciplinary Committee, hence dismissing the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> This then led the plaintiff to filing a writ action on the 3 October 2005, at the Johor Bahru High Court and among others, prayed for:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On 15 November 2010, the High Court found in favour of the plaintiff. In allowing the plaintiff's claim, the High Court held that the defendant was in breach of the rules of natural justice by not giving the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard when it did not hold a hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The High Court went on to decide that reg 28 of the Disciplinary Rules must be interpreted <i>vis-a-vis</i> reg 25 and held that by its interpretation, reg 25(2) required the defendant to record in writing the reason why it was not practical to comply with the Regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Following from this, the High Court allowed the plaintiff's claim namely that his employment be restored and all arrears in salaries and allowances to be paid to him from 1 March 2002 to 10 January 2004 (date of retirement) and the consequential reliefs prayed for with costs of RM6,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the High Court. The Court of Appeal in allowing the defendant's appeal held that reg 25(1) of the Disciplinary Rules, which provides that no officer can be dismissed or reduced in rank in any disciplinary proceedings unless he is informed in writing about the intended disciplinary proceedings and that he is given a reasonable opportunity to be heard, had been complied with by the defendant. The plaintiff was served with a show cause letter informing him about the charges preferred and that he was given two months to reply to the said letter before the Disciplinary Committee finally decided to dismiss him from his employment with the defendant. Relying on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_93;"><i>Ghazi Mohd Sawi v. Mohd Haniff Omar, Ketua Polis Negara, Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 93</LINK>; [1994] 2 MLJ 114; [1994] 2 CLJ 333; [1994] 2 AMR 1257, the Court of Appeal held that from the evidence it was clear that the plaintiff had been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard; the plaintiff was given sufficient time to reply to the show cause letter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The Court of Appeal held, <i>inter alia</i>, that the defendant had complied with all the procedures. In its Ground of Judgment the Court of Appeal stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Question Of Law On Appeal To The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On 21 May 2014, the plaintiff's application for leave to appeal was allowed on the following question:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The disciplinary proceeding against the plaintiff was carried out under the provisions of reg 28 of the Disciplinary Rules. It should be stressed that the show cause letter dated 21 June 2000 referred to reg 28, and it specifically stated the breach of discipline complained of against the plaintiff was of a nature, which merits a punishment of dismissal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> As will be explained later in the judgment, for the proper determination of the question posed to us, the issue must be approached on the basis of the following provisions of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> First, reg 28(1) of the Disciplinary Rules, which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In essence, reg 28(1) generally provides that the Disciplinary Committee shall, after considering all the available information in its possession that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for dismissal or reduction in rank, cause to be sent to the officer a statement in writing, of the ground or grounds on which it proposes to dismiss the officer or reduce him in rank and shall call upon him to state in writing within a period of not less than 21 days from the date of receipt of the letter a representation containing grounds upon which he relies to exculpate himself. As indicated earlier, on 21 June 2000, the defendant's Disciplinary Committee wrote to the plaintiff informing him of the decision to institute disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiff under reg 28 of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Second, reg 28(4), which prescribes, with the necessary emphasis:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And third, reg 28(7), which provides, with the necessary emphasis:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> From the above provisions it is clear that the establishment of an Investigation Committee may be made under reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules. It provides that if the Disciplinary Committee considers that a case against an officer requires further clarification, it may establish an Investigation Committee for the purpose of obtaining such further clarification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In a disciplinary proceeding initiated under reg 28, such an opportunity to be heard orally can only arise under reg 28(4) at the 'Investigation Committee' stage. It is only if an Investigation Committee is appointed because the Disciplinary Committee required further clarification that the officer will be afforded the opportunity of giving oral testimony to exculpate himself (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_1;"><i>Ganasan Marimuthu v. Public Services Commission &amp; Anor</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 1</LINK>; [1998] 4 MLJ 280; [1998] 4 CLJ 331; [1998] 4 AMR 3478).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Regulation 28(7) provides that if witnesses are called and examined by the Investigation Committee, the officer should be allowed to be present and to cross-examine the witnesses and no documentary evidence should be used against the officer unless the officer has previously been supplied with a copy of the evidence. This is consistent with the basic concept of natural justice, which is built upon the well known adage that no one should be condemned unheard (see <i>Administrative Law of Malaysia and Singapore</i>, 3rd edn by Professor MP Jain at p 226).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The fundamental question which we must then ask here is: Whether the Investigation Committee pursuant to reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules had been established by the Disciplinary Committee for the purpose of obtaining further clarification?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> This then brings into sharp focus the contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff to the effect that the defendant had made unequivocal admission in his statement of defence as regard the formation of the Investigation Committee and calling of witnesses to take further evidence. To this end, learned counsel then took us through the defendant's statement of defence. In particular he brought to our attention paras 8.1 and 8.2, which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Given the above averments, learned counsel argued that a witness could only be called to testify under reg 28(7) of the Disciplinary Rules when an Investigation Committee was formed under reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules. This is the essence of his contention. On the basis of the explicit admission in paras 8.1 and 8.2 of the statement of defence, he argued that the Investigation Committee was in actual fact established for the purpose of obtaining further clarification and that witnesses were called to give evidence before the Investigation Committee. Considered in that way, learned counsel argued that the plaintiff was not notified of the date and time of the inquiry before the Investigation Committee and for that reason, he added, the plaintiff was not given the opportunity to be present at the hearing of the Investigation Committee, and the plaintiff was deprived of the right to cross-examine the witnesses and also to produce any witnesses or evidence to rebut, contradict or explain further to the Investigation Committee. As a result, he submitted, the disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiff had infringed reg 28(7) of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Relying on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1962_1_233;"><i>B Surinder Singh Kanda v. The Government Of The Federation Of Malaya</i> [1962] 1 MLRA 233</LINK>; [1962] MLJ 169, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1990_1_69;"><i>Shamsiah Ahmad Sham v.

Setiausaha Suruhanjaya Pasukan Polis &amp; Ors</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 57</LINK>; [1995] 1 MLJ 308; [1995] 1 CLJ 619; [1995] 1 AMR 855, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that it is trite law that procedural fairness dictated that evidence should not be taken behind the plaintiff's back. Hence, he submitted that the disciplinary proceedings resulting in the plaintiff's dismissal was flawed because there were serious breach of the rules of natural justice and serious breach of mandatory procedures.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It has to be highlighted at this point that no report of the alleged Investigation Committee was ever adduced in evidence. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that all the documents from pp 488-557 of Part B of the Record of Appeal (save for pp 536-537) pertaining to the alleged establishment and inquiry of the Investigation Committee were excluded by this court on 26 January 2015 when the defendant's application to strike out the Record of Appeal was dismissed on the ground that those documents were not part of the trial evidence before the High Court; it should not therefore have been included in the Record of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In this respect, it is pertinent to note that the High Court made a factual finding that 'there is no evidence to show that an investigation committee was appointed. This is corroborated by the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of any investigation committee in the disciplinary committee's letter dated 17 May 2001'. To which we will add that a person who asserts the existence of any fact must prove that the fact exists (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_2_205;"><i>Syarikat Kemajuan Timbermine Sdn Bhd v. Kerajaan Negeri Kelantan Darul Naim</i> [2015] 2 MLRA 205</LINK>; [2015] 3 MLJ 609; [2015] 2 CLJ 1037).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> This leaves us therefore to consider this crucial question: whether, on the basis of the pleadings alone, a finding can be made that an Investigation Committee was in fact established as asserted by the plaintiff pursuant to reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In refuting the contention of the plaintiff that an Investigation Committee had in fact been established, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that in the first place the approach taken by the plaintiff in the present case differed entirely from his pleaded claim. Learned counsel referred to para 22 the plaintiff's statement of claim, which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> He pointed out that the plaintiff's pleaded claim was that the defendant had breached reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules when it failed to establish an Investigation Committee for the purpose of obtaining further clarification by way of examining witnesses. To put the point differently, the plaintiff's pleaded case was about the non-application of reg 28 of the Disciplinary Rules, whereas the plaintiff's position before this court was that an Investigation Committee under reg 28 was established and that he was not called upon to attend it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> To support his submission that a court should not decide an issue that is not pleaded, he brought to our attention the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_327;"><i>Yew Wan Leong v. Lai Kok Chye</i> [1990] 1 MLRA 327</LINK>; [1990] 2 MLJ 152; [1990] 1 CLJ 330.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In our view, there is merit in the submissions of learned counsel for the defendant. It is a well-settled legal principle that the court should not decide on an issue that was not pleaded by the parties as had been decided in <i>Yew Wan Leong v. Lai Kok Chye (supra)</i> where the Supreme Court cited <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_360;"><i>Janagi v. Ong Boon Kiat</i> [1971] 1 MLRH 360</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 196 and agreed with the following passage of Sharma J which stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We should remind ourselves that parties to an action are bound by their own pleadings. It is therefore necessary to make the point that the court is also bound by the pleadings in as much as the parties themselves. The most important purpose of pleadings is to plead reasonable cause of action, define the issues of fact and questions of law to be determined by the court. It is a valid argument to make that the court is constrained to decide an action on which no issue has been raised by the parties in their respective pleadings (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_459;"><i>Ambank (M) Berhad v. Luqman Kamil Mohammed Don</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 459</LINK>; [2012] 3 MLJ 1; [2012] 3 CLJ 551 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_8_731;"><i>Victory Avenue Mfg (M) Sdn Bhd v. Matsushita Electronic Devices (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 8 MLRH 731</LINK>; [2009] 5 MLJ 243).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Still most importantly to note, paras 8.1 and 8.2 in the defendant's statement of defence, as being the key plank in establishing the plaintiff's case for there existing an Investigation Committee, had been tellingly denied by the plaintiff himself at para 5 of his reply to the defendant's statement of defence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The basic fact that can be gleaned from the above is that a factual assertion made by the defendant in paras 8.1 and 8.2 in its statement of defence was responded to by way of a general traverse in the plaintiff's statement of reply when he averred that except where previously admitted, the plaintiff denied each and every allegation contained in the defendant's statement of defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the context of the present case, what then is the effect of the general traverse or the <i>seriatim</i> clause?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;18.;;">Order 18 r 13 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (equipollent with the present Rules of Court 2012)</LINK> is relevant, and provides a good starting point:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> From the above provisions, it can be seen that a traverse operates to deny an allegation of fact. As a matter of broad general principle, the effect of a general traverse is to deny each and every factual allegation raised by the opposing party (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_3_743;"><i>Borneo Housing Mortgage Finance Berhad v. The Personal Representative Of The Estate Of Maureen Lee Lun Wah (Deceased) &amp; Anor</i> [1993] 3 MLRH 743</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 209; [1994] 1 CLJ 501, <i>John Lancaster Radiators Ltd v. General Motor Radiator Co Ltd</i> [1946] 2 All ER 685 and <i>Warner v. Sampson and Another</i> [1959] 1 QB 297).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In the result, therefore, as things stood, the obvious consequence of the general traverse contained in para 5 of the plaintiff's statement reply was to deny the defendant's factual allegation that an Investigation Committee was in fact established. It has to be pointed out that the plaintiff's denial of the establishment of the Investigation Committee was in direct contradiction of its present contention that an Investigation Committee was in fact formed under reg 28(4) of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> This then brings us to the submissions of learned counsel for the plaintiff that as a result of the general traverse, the onus of proof had shifted to the defendant to prove that the Investigation Committee was in fact established for the purpose of obtaining further clarification by way of examining witnesses. With respect, we are not persuaded with this line of arguments. For the purposes of this appeal, it is necessary to bear in mind that from the outset it was upon the plaintiff himself, and certainly not the defendant, to discharge the overall burden of proving his case and satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that his claim as pleaded in the statement of claim was well-founded before the court could grant judgment in his favour (see <i>Syarikat Kemajuan Timbermine Sdn Bhd v. Kerajaan Negeri Kelantan Darul Naim (supra)</i>). The stand taken by the defendant not to prove the said averments was of the defendant's choice. However, that did not absolve the plaintiff from discharging the overall burden of proving his claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Even more significantly, as submitted by the defendant's learned counsel, the plaintiff in his statement of reply did not make any admission against the facts averred in the defendant's statement of defence. To be more specific, the plaintiff did not admit paras 8.1 and 8.2 of the statement of defence to support his contention that an Investigation Committee was in fact established and that he was not called for the hearing. We should also note that it would be a different thing if the plaintiff admitted to those paragraphs in his statement of reply. But most problematically, and it gets worse for the plaintiff when he denied the said paras 8.1 and 8.2. The contradiction was never fully resolved. To be sure, what all the statement of reply contained was merely a series of denials and a general traverse clause at the end. In truth, the tenor and thrust of the plaintiff's statement of reply is a total rejection of the defendant's factual averments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In our judgment, the defendant's averments in paras 8.1 and 8.2 of the statement of defence ultimately have no bearing on the plaintiff's case. The fact that the defendant pleaded in that fashion did not alter the fact that the plaintiff's pleaded case was his dissatisfaction with the non formation of the Investigation Committee. Now, before this court, the plaintiff was trying to argue something quite different from his pleaded case without even the support of evidence. But as we have said earlier, the law is trite that the court should not decide an issue, which was not pleaded by the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In light of our findings and in the circumstances of this case, there is no necessity for us to answer the question as framed. In consequence, this appeal must fail. We accordingly dismiss it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> This judgment is prepared pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;78.;;">s 78(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, as our learned brother, Justice Apandi Ali FCJ had since resigned upon his appointment as the Attorney General of Malaysia.</p>
