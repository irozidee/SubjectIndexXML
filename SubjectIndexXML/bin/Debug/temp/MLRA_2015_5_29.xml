      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant appealed against the decision of the High Court dismissing the appellant's application (encl 14) to set aside several orders. The impugned orders were: (i) order dated 15 January 2003 against the appellant declaring the sale of land to the appellant null and void - obtained in the absence of the appellant; (ii) order dated 13 January 2003 allowing <i>inter alia</i>, the respondent's application to treat an unstamped trust deed as the original; and (iii) order dated 21 March 2003 - allowing an amendment to the order dated 15 January 2003 following an application to amend, which was not served upon the appellant. The appellant also complained that the service of the relevant cause papers and process was not regular.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Setting aside orders obtained as in the instant case was very much an exercise of judicial discretion to ensure that the litigation was heard upon the merits. It was only by getting the facts right and applying the law thereon could justice unquestionably be done. (para 8)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The grounds of the High Court's decision, on the facts, lacked the reasoning for findings that formed the foundation for the dismissal. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Service and giving notice to the other party as to what is being relied upon, is the very foundation that enables a party to be heard in his own defence before an order is made against him. Confidence that justice is done on the merits depends upon it. It is not a game of numbers and technicalities. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, there were more than sufficient grounds to render the orders made on 15 January 2003, 13 January 2003 and 21 March 2003 unsustainable, and ought to be set aside. (para 17)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Chai Say Fah ("the appellant") appealed against the decision of the High Court dismissing the appellant's application vide summons in chambers encl 14 ("encl 14") to set aside the orders made on 15 January 2003, 13 January 2003 and 21 March 2003.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The basis of the reasoning of the High Court is contained in this passage of the grounds of judgment on encl 14:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The above requires appreciation of:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Orders Sought Under Enclosure 14</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4] </b>By encl 14, the appellant had sought orders as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Orders Made On 15 January 2003, 13 January 2003 And 21 March 2003</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The orders dated 13 January 2003 and 21 March 2003 were <i>ex parte</i> orders. It was submitted that the order of 15 January 2003 was a purported default order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The law requires that a plaintiff to be prepared to prove his case upon a balance of probabilities. Thus, it has been held by the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1988_1_288;"><i>Fira Development Sdn Bhd v. Goldwin Sdn Bhd</i> [1988] 1 MLRA 288</LINK>; [1989] 1 MLJ 40; [1989] 1 CLJ 32 that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Nothing much more need to be added to the above exposition. Justice requires that litigation is disposed off on the merits of the case, and not on the secondary merits of adherence to provisions of the rules, unless it is demonstrated that the non-compliance is contumelious or has denied the other party from a fair opportunity to defend himself. Delay does not affect a plaintiff as much as he is expected to be ready to prove its case upon a balance of probabilities and must therefore be ready with the evidence, unless of course critical witnesses unexpectedly had passed on.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Whether to set aside the orders so obtained as in this case is very much an exercise of judicial discretion to ensure that the litigation is heard upon its merits, for only by getting the facts right and applying the law thereon can justice unquestionably be done. That is justice of the first order. Whereas an order obtained on technical grounds remains a match call, with the justice on the merits of the litigation being debateable. This latter is justice of the second order. If justice of the first order remains capable of being achieved and the delay capable of being remedied by an order of costs, then justice of the second order cannot stand in its way.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In this case, the reasoning by the High Court is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It struck us that the reasoning that there is no injustice to dismiss the application in encl 14 because an application to reinstate the case can be entertained if encl 14 is dismissed is flawed, for the court cannot bind itself to entertain affirmatively an application it had suggested, unless the parties had been heard thereon. If the court were so minded to allow the other application which was not yet made, then it should allow encl 14.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The grounds themselves are an outline of the findings made that led to the decision:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The grounds lacked the reasoning for the findings that formed the foundation for the dismissal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The background facts may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The issue concerns whether there had been regular service. Only if service has been otherwise regular, then only the considerations in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_5_175;"><i>Serac Asia Sdn Bhd v. Sepakat Insurance Brokers Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] 5 MLRA 175</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 1; [2013] 6 CLJ 673; [2013] 4 AMR 385 become applicable. The affidavit of service did not state the day of the week and date on which it was served. The said process server was from the firm of the solicitors acting for the respondent, where the solicitor handling the encl 14 was charged at the Sessions Court Penang for fraud and perjury involving a plot of land in Penang and was convicted and sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment and was struck off. The challenge as to whether the service was in compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;10.;;">O 10 r 1(4)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;10.;;">O 10 r 6 Rules of High Court 1980</LINK> was certainly raised arguable or triable issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was submitted for the respondent that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> With respect, service, and thereby giving notice to the other party as to what is being relied upon, is the very foundation that enables a party to be heard in his own defence before an order is made against him. Confidence that justice is done on the merits depends upon it. It is not a game of numbers and technicalities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We concluded from the above there are more than sufficient grounds to render the orders made on 15 January 2003, 13 January 2003 and 21 March 2003 unsustainable, and ought to be set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We therefore allowed the appeal, entered judgment in terms of prayers (a) and (b) of encl 14, fixed costs in the sum of RM10,000.00 and ordered that the deposit be refunded.</p>
