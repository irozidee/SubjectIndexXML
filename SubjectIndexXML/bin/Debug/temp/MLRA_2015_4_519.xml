    <p>Pursuant to the plaintiff's application, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, the Terengganu State Government, through the State Economic Planning Unit (UPEN) and the 3<sup>rd</sup>defendant, the Dungun Land Administrator, gave approval in principle to the plaintiff to extract and remove armour rocks from a piece of land ("the quarry land"). The approval was to supply armour rocks for Petronas projects. The approval had neither an expiry date nor a fixed duration. To facilitate the removal of armour rocks and to transport them from the quarry land to the Petronas Polyethylene/Ethylene project and then to the Kerteh Breakwater project, the plaintiff had to construct access roads, jetties and tetrapod yards. The plaintiff claimed that it had spent some RM9,898,000 in costs for constructing such an infrastructure. To facilitate the quarry operations, temporary occupation licences (TOL) were granted to the plaintiff by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant. Pursuant to the approval, various Form C permits were issued to the plaintiff by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant from June 1994 until December 2000 for the extraction and removal of the armour rocks. The plaintiff duly extracted the rocks and stockpiled them at various locations, including on private land and on the State's beach land. This was done with the knowledge and consent of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant. In 1996 the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant through UPEN gave approval to its investment arm - the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant - to operate a quarry on State land adjacent to the plaintiff's quarry land. The actual quarrying works were contracted out to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. By letter dated 20 July 1998, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant told the plaintiff it no longer had any right to carry quarry operations on the quarry land as the quarry operations had been approved to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant since 12 July 1996. The plaintiff was denied access to the quarry land and to its stockpile of armour rocks and rock by-products. With approval of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant from mid-1998 to 2000 proceeded to remove the armour rocks and processed rocks from the plaintiff's stockpiles. The plaintiff's written complaints to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants fell on deaf ears. The plaintiff's grievance was that the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by their acts and manipulations had wrongfully prevented it from extracting the armour rocks from the quarry land and had converted to their own use the rocks and rock by-products stockpiled at the various locations and had further unlawfully prevented it from using the jetty to transport the stockpiles out. The plaintiff sued the defendants based on the tort of conversion and misfeasance in public office. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not deny removing the rocks but justified it by saying that it had been given approval to do so by UPEN. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant's defence was that it was not involved at all in the removal of the rocks and it pushed the entire blame on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, its own subsidiary which had been wound up. The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants did not deny preventing the plaintiff from extracting and removing rocks from the quarry land and from using the jetty. Their position, however, was that with the completion of the Polythylene/Ethylene project in 1995, the armour rocks and quarry products became the properties of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and the plaintiff no longer had any right of ownership over them. The plaintiff's rights over the rocks came to an end when the project was completed in 1995. Therefore, it was lawful for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants to remove and sell the rocks, which were lying on State land, to third parties. The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant further claimed that the plaintiff had failed to settle balance of royalty payments for the rocks to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant. The High Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim with costs. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Conversion is a tort of strict liability. The tort of conversion can be committed by various persons, each of whom in a series of conversions wrongfully exclude the owner from the possession of his goods. <i>Development &amp; Commercial Bank Bhd v. Liew Weng Hang &amp; Ors (folld); Kuwait Airways Corpn v. Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5) (refd)</i>. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was clear from the letter of approval that the approval was for Petronas projects generally and not for any Petronas project in particular. Nowhere in the letter was there any proviso that the approval was only for the Polythylene/Ethylene Project. Such restriction was in fact imposed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant who was the authority to define the scope of approval as provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;70.;;">s 70 of the National Land Code</LINK>. Clearly the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant being subordinate to the State Authority/UPEN had no power to modify, let alone override the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant's decision on the terms of the approval. This court would reject the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' assertion that the approval was only for the Polythylene/Ethylene project, although the rocks extracted by the plaintiff were indeed meant for the Polythylene/Ethylene project. (paras 25-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> What was clear was that since it was the plaintiff who extracted the rocks and not the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiff was therefore the rightful owner of the stockpiles notwithstanding the fact that they were kept on State land. It was inconceivable that the defendants could claim ownership of these rocks simply because the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been given approval by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to remove them from the plaintiff's quarry land. What they did not own they could not claim as theirs just because the State Authority had given the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant "approval". (paras 37-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> With regard to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' claim that the plaintiff failed to settle the outstanding royalty payments, the claim, on the facts, was baseless. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> On the evidence and having regard to the probabilities of the case, the acts of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants fell squarely within the meaning of conversion. The acts of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in approving the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant's entry into the quarry land, who then removed the processed rocks through its contractor, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, was wrongful as the plaintiff had a subsisting right to carry out quarry operations on the quarry land. Liability for conversion had been established against all four defendants. (paras 41-42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6) </b>In the tort of misfeasance in public office, there is no need to name the public officer concerned. It is sufficient to name his office. The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' wrongful acts in the conversion of the plaintiff's goods were committed repetitiously over a period of almost two years despite many written complaints by the plaintiff. This was done with improper motive and in bad faith to injure the plaintiff. (paras 45-46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> In the instant case, damages would more appropriately be awarded under the tort of conversion. The plaintiff was not entitled to the costs of constructing the infrastructures as they were necessary for the quarry operations. They were not built on the instructions of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants. The plaintiff was entitled to RM14,355,839.69 representing the total value of the rocks and quarry products stockpiled at the beach land and the value of those stockpiled at the rented private lands. The defendants did not challenge the plaintiff's evidence nor did they adduce evidence to contradict the plaintiff's evidence on the value of the rocks and quarry products. Interest on the sum was 8% per annum from the date of accrual until the date of full settlement. The plaintiff's claim for loss of business of RM91,200,000 was speculative at best and ought to be dismissed. (paras 47-56)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's claim against the respondents was for a sum of RM14,355,839.69 being the total market value of rocks and rock by-products belonged to the appellant which the respondents allegedly converted to their own use, RM9,898,000.00 for costs of constructing infrastructures at the quarry site and RM91,200,000.00 for loss of business. The claim was founded on the tort of conversion and misfeasance in public office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> After a full trial at the Kuala Terengganu High Court, the learned trial judge found in favour of the respondents and dismissed the appellant's claim with costs. This is the appellant's appeal against the whole of the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The learned judge who tried the case had gone on early retirement and did not provide any grounds of judgment. We do not, therefore, have the benefit of the trial court's reasoning for dismissing the appellant claim nor its findings on crucial issues of fact. It thus fell upon us to review the entire evidence and to come to our own findings. We heard the arguments on 26 March 2015 and we reserved judgment, <i>curia advisari vult</i>. We have now reached a unanimous decision and this is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We shall refer to the parties as they were in the High Court, ie the appellant as the plaintiff and the respondents as the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in that order. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been wound up on 20 March 2007 and was represented by the Official Receiver in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The salient facts have been set out, quite accurately in our view, by learned counsel for the plaintiff and can be summarised as follows. The plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant are private companies limited by shares. Both having their registered addresses at Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu Darul Iman whilst the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is a public company having its registered address at Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is a subsidiary of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and is owned and controlled by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant on the other hand is a subsidiary of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (the State Government) and its investment arm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Pursuant to the plaintiff's application, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant through the State Economic Planning Unit ("UPEN") and the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, gave approval in principle to the plaintiff to extract and remove armour rocks (batu pejal @ bongkah batu) from a piece of land at Pasir Panjang beach, Mukim Kuala Paka, Dungun Terengganu ("the quarry land"). These armour rocks were meant for the Petronas projects subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants. The material part of the approval letter which is dated 13 September 1992 reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The approval was therefore to supply armour rocks for "Projek-Projek Petronas" (Petronas projects). No expiry date was fixed nor the duration of the approval. To facilitate removal of the armour rocks and to transport them from the quarry land to the Polyethylene/Ethylene project and later to the Kerteh Breakwater project, the plaintiff constructed the necessary infrastructures, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b>According to the plaintiff, it spent RM2,198,000.00 on the access road, RM6 million on the jetty and RM1.7 million on the tetrapod yard. To facilitate the quarry operations, temporary occupation licences (TOL) were granted to the plaintiff by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant for occupation of the jetty and the tetrapod yard.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The premium payable for the rocks to be extracted from the quarry land was fixed at RM1.80 per cubic meter, which was to be paid to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant. Pursuant to the approval, various Form C permits were issued to the plaintiff by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant from June 1994 until December 2000 for the extraction and removal of the armour rocks. The plaintiff duly extracted the rocks and stockpiled them at various locations including on rented private lands as well as on the State's beach land. This was done with the knowledge and consent of the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Dispute</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Everything changed in 1996 when the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant through UPEN gave approval to its investment arm, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, to operate a quarry on 28.32 hectares of State's land adjacent to the plaintiff's quarry land. The actual quarry works were, however, contracted to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Two years later, by letter dated 20 July 1998, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant told the plaintiff that it no longer had any right to carry out quarry operations on the quarry land as the quarry operations had been approved to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant since 12 July 1996. The plaintiff was denied access to the quarry land and thus to its stockpile of armour rocks and rock by-products.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Armed with the approval by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant from mid-1998 to 2000 proceeded to remove the armour rocks and processed rocks from the plaintiff's stockpiles. The plaintiff's written complaints to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants fell on deaf ears. This fact has been documented and can be found in the plaintiff's Core Bundle (ACOB) at pp 17-26.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiff's Grievance</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The plaintiff's grievance was that the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 4<sup>th</sup> defendants by their acts and manipulations had wrongfully prevented it from extracting the armour rocks from the quarry land and had converted to their own use the rocks and rock by-products stockpiled at the various locations and had further unlawfully prevented it from using the jetty to transport the stockpiles out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b>The plaintiff's estimation of the value of the rocks and rock by-products stockpiled at the beach land was RM4,204,435.42 and RM10,151,404.27 for the rocks stockpiled at the private lands, totaling RM14,355,839.69.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respective Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not deny removing the rocks but justified it by saying that it had been given approval to do so by UPEN. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant's defence, on the other hand, was that it was not involved at all in the removal of the rocks. Instead, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant pushed the entire blame on the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, its own subsidiary which has been wound up.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> As for the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, they did not deny preventing the plaintiff from extracting and removing rocks from the quarry land and from using the jetty. Their position, however, is that with the completion of the Polythylene/ Ethylene project in 1995, the armour rocks and quarry products became the properties of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and the plaintiff no longer had any right of ownership over them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b>The basis for the argument is that since the approval for the extraction of the armour rocks was only for the purpose of the Polythylene/Ethylene project, the plaintiff's rights over the rocks came to an end when this particular project was completed in 1995. The sequel to the argument is that it was lawful for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants to remove and sell the rocks, which were lying on State's land, to third parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As a further justification to deprive the plaintiff of the rocks, it was the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant's case that the plaintiff failed to settle the balance of the royalty for the rocks to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant as agreed. According to defence witness SD2, the plaintiff failed to settle the outstanding royalty payments from December 1994.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conversion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The question is whether by their acts, the defendants had committed the tort of conversion. As to what in law constitutes conversion, the learned authors of <i>Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort</i>, 15th edn 1998 describe the misdemeanour as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_2_291;"><i>Development &amp; Commercial Bank Bhd v. Liew Weng Hang &amp; Ors</i> [2007] 2 MLRA 291</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 764; [2007] 6 CLJ 260 the Court of Appeal held, <i>inter alia</i>, that conversion is a tort of strict liability. At p 292, Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) delivering the judgment of the court, explained:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b>The tort of conversion can be committed by various persons each of whom in a series of conversions wrongfully excluded the owner from the possession of his goods (see the House of Lords decision in <i>Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5)</i> [2002] 2 AC 883). It was held in that case that where there are multiple tortfeasors who commit the tort of conversion in respect of the same goods belonging to the same plaintiff, each tortfeasor is liable to pay damages to the plaintiff for his tort of conversion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is the plaintiff's contention that it did not at any material time commit any breach of the terms of the approval and neither had it been issued with any termination letter by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. This is undisputed and in fact admitted by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant through SD1 and SD2 in their testimonies under cross-examination. When asked to confirm that the plaintiff did not breach any term of the approval this was SD1's answer:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b>As alluded to earlier, the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' defence was that the approval that was given to the plaintiff was only for the Polythylene/Ethylene project and not for all or any Petronas project that required the supply of armour rocks. The starting point for any discussion on this issue has to be the approval letter itself the material portion of which we have reproduced in para 7 above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Our first observation with regard to this letter of approval is that any person with a decent understanding of the Malay language will come to the conclusion that the approval was for Petronas projects generally and not for any Petronas project in particular. But of course it must be confined to the area where the quarry operation was to be carried out. What is clear is that nowhere in the letter is there any proviso that the approval was only for the Polythylene/Ethylene project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b>The restriction was in fact imposed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant vide letter dated 22 September 1993 and not by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant who was the authority to define the scope of approval as provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;70.;;">s 70 of the National Land Code</LINK>. Clearly the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant being subordinate to the State Authority/UPEN had no power to modify, let alone override the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant's decision on the terms of the approval.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Under cross-examination by learned counsel for the plaintiff, defence witness SD1 candidly admitted that "UPEN tidak ada kuasa". We, therefore, reject the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' assertion that the approval was only for the Polythylene/Ethylene project. In any event, the rocks extracted by the plaintiff were indeed meant for the Plythylene/Ethylene project. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> UPEN had also admitted at the trial that it did not check whether or not the Petronas projects were still subsisting at the time it issued the approval to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. This is odd given that the reason why it granted approval to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to operate the quarry in the first place was because the Petronas projects had been completed and there was thus no further need for the supply of armour rocks.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The evidence further shows that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not carry out any blasting or quarry operation despite applying for and given approval to carry out such activities. This is not surprising as neither the 2<sup>nd</sup> nor the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had any prior experience in quarry operations. Perhaps to make up for their lack of experience, what the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> defendants did instead was to tell the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to issue a letter (which the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant obliged) to confirm that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had the "sole and exclusive rights" over the armour rocks. We have no doubt that the intention was to override the plaintiff's ownership of its stockpile of rocks and rock by-products. From the plaintiff's point of view this reeks of a rip off.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> After giving approval to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to carry out quarry operations at the quarry land, the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant followed it up by rejecting the plaintiff's application for extension of the TOL for the jetty. Without the use of the jetty there was no way the plaintiff could transport out their stockpile of armour rocks and quarry products from the quarry land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> It was a calculated move by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant. We are constrained to agree with the plaintiff that this was a pretext by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants to deny the plaintiff of the use of the jetty and therefore access to its stockpile of rocks and rock by-products on the quarry land. The intention obviously was to facilitate the taking over of the plaintiff's rock stockpiles by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> With the benefit of these overt acts by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on numerous occasions from 1998 to 2000 proceeded to remove the plaintiff's stockpiles from the quarry land and other locations and supplied them to the Petronas projects. There can be no argument that this had caused loss to the plaintiff and unlawful gain to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Evidence was led that at the meeting on 13 August 2000 held at UPEN's office, the Dungun Land Office was directed by the Deputy Director of UPEN to give written reasons with regard to the following matters:</p>

      <b>[34]</b> First of all, we find it rather strange for the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (through UPEN) to seek answers to these questions from the Dungun Land Office when it was the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant itself who instructed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to remove and sell the rocks from the plaintiff's stockpiles. For reasons best known to itself, the Dungun Land Office did not respond to the instruction despite written reminders by UPEN and the firm of Jacob Goldie &amp; Toh acting for the plaintiff. Whatever may be the reason for the clam up, the failure by the Dungun Land Office to respond cannot absolve the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants of liability for the conversion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The Dungun Land Office is subordinate to both the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants. Therefore, its failure to respond must be taken as failure by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants themselves to provide answers to those questions. In any event, the buck ends with the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant, being the ultimate authority on land matters. In all probability the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants already knew the answers to those questions as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in its letter dated 15 October 1998 had written to UPEN acknowledging that the plaintiff had ownership rights over the existing stockpiles unless it had been granted exclusive rights over the land. The truth in our view is that the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants had no valid answer to any of the questions as they knew that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was illegally removing rocks and rock by-products belonging to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The date of the meeting, ie 13 August 2000 is important in the whole scheme of things. The significance of the date is that it debunks the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' assertion that by 1995 the Petronas projects had been completed and that therefore the plaintiff had no reason to continue with the quarry operations. Implicit in questions (b) and (c) posed by the Deputy Director of UPEN above is an admission that the rocks and rock by-products rightfully belonged to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In our view, this is so even if it is true that the approval given to the plaintiff was only for the purpose of the Polythylene/Ethylene project as claimed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants. What is clear to our mind is that since it was the plaintiff who extracted these rocks and not the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiff was therefore the rightful owner of the stockpiles notwithstanding the fact that they were kept on State land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It is inconceivable that the defendants could claim ownership of these rocks simply because the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been given approval by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to remove them from the plaintiff's quarry land. What they did not own they cannot claim as theirs just because the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been given "approval" by the State Authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> With regard to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' claim that the plaintiff failed to settle the outstanding royalty payment, we find the claim to be baseless. The unchallenged evidence shows that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant whom the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants had given approval to operate the quarry had removed and sold all of the processed rocks from the plaintiff's stockpile. The stockpiles were sold to See Song &amp; Sons Sdn Bhd who in turn supplied them to Petronas for the Polythylene Marine Facilities Phase II.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Further, there was a mutual agreement between the Land Office and the plaintiff that instalment payments for the royalties were to be made as and when the processed rocks were removed from the stockpiles. This can be seen from the evidence of the Director of the plaintiff (SP7) and the evidence of the Assistant Land Officer (SP9) who confirmed that this was common practice with the land office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> On the evidence and having regard to the probabilities of the case it is our finding that the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' acts fall squarely within the meaning of conversion as described by the learned authors of Winfield &amp; Jolowicz quoted above and the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5) (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We further agree with learned counsel for the plaintiff that the acts of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in approving the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant's entry into the quarry land who then removed the processed rocks through its contractor the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was wrongful as the plaintiff had a subsisting right to carry out quarry operations on the quarry land. It is our finding that liability for conversion had been established against all four defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Misfeasance In Public Office</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The allegation of misfeasance in public office was directed at the 3<sup>rd</sup> and/or 4<sup>th</sup> defendants. In <i>Bourgoin SA and Others v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</i> [1986] 1 QB 716, the English Court of Appeal (per Oliver LJ) on the facts of the case made the following observations on the tort of misfeasance in Public Office:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Both the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants denied the allegation of misfeasance in public office. It was argued by learned counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants that the allegation cannot be sustained for the reason that the plaintiff failed to name the officers alleged to have committed the tortious acts. It was further argued that the decision to approve the quarry operation was made by the State Executive Council (MMKN) and not the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant and that since the MMKN was not named as a party in this action, the plaintiff's action founded as it was on misfeasance in public office must fail. No authority was cited in support of the proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In our view, counsel's argument is misconceived. There is no need to name the public officer concerned. It is sufficient to name his office. In <i>Three Rivers DC v. Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 2)</i> [2000] 2 WLR 1220 the House of Lords described the tort as the only tort available solely against public authorities or persons holding public office. It consists of an abuse of power by a public authority or person holding public office that is affected by malice or bad faith and that deprives the plaintiff of some benefit or causes him some loss. Government departments, local authorities, and courts and tribunals are all public authorities (see <i>Oxford Dictionary of Law</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> edn).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Having regard to the evidence before the court we are in agreement with the plaintiff that the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' wrongful acts in the conversion of the plaintiff's goods were committed repetitiously over a period of almost two years despite many written complaints by the plaintiff. We agree that this was done with improper motive and in bad faith to injure the plaintiff, as evidenced in particular by the following circumstances:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Measure Of Damages</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> We now come to the measure of damages. As the law does not allow for double recovery of damages, the market values of the armour rocks and rock by-products can only be awarded once, either under the tort of conversion or the tort of misfeasance in public office. As between the two, it is our considered view that damages may more appropriately be awarded under the tort of conversion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The first items claimed by the plaintiff were the expenses incurred in constructing the infrastructures totaling RM9,898,000.00. According to the plaintiff, it is entitled to the costs of constructing these infrastructures as they were necessary for the quarry operations. In our considered view and taking into account the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' submission on this point, the plaintiff is not entitled to these costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> We are in agreement with the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants that the plaintiff must bear its own costs for these infrastructures as they were not built on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' instructions. No doubt they were necessary for the quarry operations but the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants should not be burdened with costs which the plaintiff incurred voluntarily to serve its own interest and for its own benefit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We shall next consider whether the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the rocks and rock by-products which were the subject of conversion by the defendants. To begin with, the fact that these rocks were in existence is irrefutable as shown by the following evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> We have stated earlier that the plaintiff's estimation of the total value of the rocks and quarry products stockpiled at the beach land was RM4,204,435.42 and the value of those stockpiled at the rented private lands was RM10,151,404.27,giving a grand total of RM14,355,839.69. The prices and values of these rocks at the time of conversion had been substantiated by the Quantity Surveyor (SP8) and supported by his report at exh P77.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The unit prices and values of the rocks had also been confirmed by the Quarry Supervisor (SP5) and the Quarry Administrative and Finance Manager (SP6). The detailed breakdown of the sums claimed had been tabulated by the plaintiff through their witnesses and the documentary evidence and we do not see any need to reproduce them in this judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> What is relevant to note is that the defendants did not challenge nor adduce any evidence to contradict the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses on the quantities, unit prices or the values of the rocks at the plaintiff's stockpiles. Their evidence is, therefore, deemed to be admitted. We do not, therefore, see any merit in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants' contention that the plaintiff failed to prove the sums claimed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Having given careful consideration to the matter, we are satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to these sums. Accordingly we order that the sum of RM14,355,839.69 be paid to the plaintiff with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of accrual until the date of full settlement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The plaintiff had also claimed for loss of business. It was submitted that if it were not for the misfeasance in public office by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants the plaintiff could have continued to supply rocks to five Petronas projects, namely Pemecah Ombak, Pulau Duyung, Kuala Terengganu, Pemecah Ombak, Pantai Primula, Kuala Terengganu, Pemecah Ombak, Kuala Kemaman, Pemecah Ombak, Marang and the Terengganu Airport Runway.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The loss of business according to the plaintiff was to the tune of RM91,200,000.00. Having gone through the Record of Appeal, we do not find the claim to be supported by any evidence. The claim is obviously predicated on the plaintiff's belief that these five projects would be awarded to it. This is speculative at best. We therefore dismiss the plaintiff's claim for loss of business.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> As for computation of the interest rate on the judgment sum of RM14,355,839.69, we agree with learned counsel that the date of accrual should be 1 July 1999 as the tortious acts of conversion were committed over a period of many months between July 1998 and the first half of 2000. We fix interest at 8% per annum as the applicable law for any suit filed in or before 2002 is the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;42.;;">O 42 r 12 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. The plaintiff's action was filed in 2002.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> For all the reasons aforesaid, we find that the learned trial judge was wrong in dismissing the plaintiff's claim for conversion of its stockpile of rocks and rock by-products. It is our finding that the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence to establish the claim on the balance of probabilities. We, therefore, set aside the trial court's order and substitute it with an order that the plaintiff's claim be allowed with costs. Order accordingly.</p>
