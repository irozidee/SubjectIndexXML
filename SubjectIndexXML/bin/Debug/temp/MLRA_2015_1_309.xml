    <p>The appellant was the developer of a housing project. It entered into five sale and purchase agreements ("SPAs") with purchasers. The purchasers paid 10% of the purchase price and obtained loans from the respondent for the balance. The appellant subsequently executed the relevant memoranda of transfer in favour of the purchasers and the relevant memoranda of charge in favour of the respondent. The appellant issued Letters of Undertaking to the effect that, in the event the discharge of charges, memoranda of transfer and the memoranda of charges could not be registered, the appellant would reimburse the monies paid. The respondent also issued Letters of Undertaking and undertook to pay to the appellant, for and on behalf of the purchasers, the balance purchase price once the conditions precedent had been satisfied. Just before the respondent fulfilled its obligations under the Letters of Undertaking, the respondent discovered that the purchasers had used fraudulent means to obtain the financing. As such the respondent refused to honour its obligations under the Letters of Undertaking. The appellant sued to recover the amounts payable under the Letters of Undertaking. The High Court however decided in favour of the respondent, mainly on the basis that the Letters of Undertaking were linked to the financing obtained by fraud and that the appellant had failed to adduce evidence to rebut the same. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It is settled law that the standard of proof required where there is an allegation of fraud in a civil proceeding must be one of beyond reasonable doubt. The burden of proving fraud is on the party alleging it. In the instant case, the burden was on the respondent. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge's findings on the issue of fraud was based not on a question of credibility of witnesses but on a question of admissibility of evidence. In the instant case, the respondent had relied heavily on DW1's evidence to establish fraud. DW1's evidence was not from or within his own knowledge. DW1's oral evidence in respect of the fraud was hearsay and clearly inadmissible. The trial judge ought to have rejected DW1's evidence in respect of the fraud. (paras 19, 21 &amp; 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The test to determine whether the judgment of the High Court ought to be reversed or altered on account of the wrongful admission of DW1's evidence was, whether without such evidence there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision. On the facts, without the hearsay evidence there was not a shred of other evidence to sustain the finding on fraud. The allegation of fraud by the respondent had not been established as the respondent had not discharged the burden of proving fraud beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge erred in her finding of fraud on the basis that the appellant did not adduce evidence to rebut fraud. (paras 25-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, upon perusing the words and operative terms used in the Letters of Undertaking from the respondent to the appellant, the intention of the parties was clear. The respondent undertook to release the sums to the appellant upon the appellant satisfying certain preconditions. The appellant had satisfied the preconditions. Upon a true construction of the respondent's Letters of Undertaking, the respondent was under a contractual obligation with the appellant to release the balance of the purchase price. The Letters of Undertaking were inextricably linked to the loan agreements as well as the sale and purchase agreements. Since fraud had not been proven, there was no reason why the respondent should not honour the Letters of Undertaking issued pursuant to the loan agreements. (paras 29-33)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal is directed against the learned High Court Judge's decision dated 8 March 2012 in dismissing the appellant's claim against the respondent for a declaration that the respondent had breached its obligations under several Letters of Undertaking and an order that the respondent complies with the Letters of Undertaking to pay the sum of RM7,776,000.00, being the amount due there under.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Briefly, the facts leading up to the commencement of the suit by the appellant are as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant is the developer of a project known as "Taman Saujana" in Johor. The appellant entered into five sale and purchase agreements with purchasers in which the appellant agreed to sell and the purchasers agreed to purchase properties subject to terms and upon the conditions contained in the respective agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Pursuant to the sale and purchase agreements, the purchasers paid 10% of the purchase price and applied for and obtained bank loan from the respondent for the balance of the purchase prices.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> As agreed, the respondent paid the redemption amounts and obtained the Issue Documents of Title to the properties from the respective finance companies. In accordance with the terms of redemption, the finance companies executed the relevant discharge for the charges that were in existence then and the same were registered in the Land Registry, Johor Bahru.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant subsequently executed the relevant memoranda of transfer in favour of the purchasers and the relevant memoranda of charge in favour of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant also issued Letters of Undertaking to the effect that, in the event the discharge of charges, memoranda of transfer and the memoranda of charges could not be registered, the appellant would reimburse the monies paid. The respondent also issued Letters of Undertaking and undertook to pay to the appellant, for and on behalf of the purchasers, the balance purchase price once the conditions precedent have been satisfied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The memoranda of transfer and the memoranda of charge were duly registered with the Land Registry, Johor Bahru. Pursuant thereto, the respondent's solicitors had advised the respondent to release the balance purchase prices to the appellant's solicitors for their onward transmission to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Prior to the respondent fulfilling its obligations under the Letters of Undertaking, the respondent discovered that the purchasers had used fraudulent means to obtain the said financing. As a result, the respondent refused to honour its obligations under the Letters of Undertaking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant then commenced legal action for the amounts payable under the Letters of Undertaking. The learned High Court Judge decided in favour of the respondent primarily on the ground that Letters of Undertaking are linked to the financing allegedly obtained by fraud and that the appellant had failed to adduce evidence to rebut the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We have heard the appeal on 18 October 2013. Upon perusal of the appeal records, and after having heard from the parties at length, we are of the considered view that this is a case in which appellate intervention is warranted. Therefore, we have allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We now give our reasons for so deciding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Fraud</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The respondent submitted that if the appellant's claim is allowed; it would contravene <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;17.;;">ss 17</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;18.;;">18</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;19.;;">19 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. It was the respondent's contention that, one Tan Ah Huat, a property agent of the appellant, had played an active role in the perpetration of the fraud. For that reason, the respondent alleged, the appellant had acted in <i>particeps criminis</i> with the purchasers in the commission of the said fraud. Further, the appellant failed to adduce any rebuttal evidence to dislodge the allegation of fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It is settled law that the standard of proof required where there is an allegation of fraud in a civil proceeding must be one of beyond reasonable doubt. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_12;"><i>Asean Security Paper Mills Sdn Bhd v. CGU Insurance Bhd</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 12</LINK>; [2007] 2 MLJ 301; [2007] 2 CLJ 1; [2000] 2 AMR 1270 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_546;"><i>Aik Ming (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Chang Ching Chuen &amp; Ors &amp; Another Case</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 546</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 770; [1995] 3 CLJ 639; [1995] 3 AMR 2375). The burden of proving fraud is on the party alleging it and in this case, the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The respondent's complaint was that the purchasers had used false and/ or forged documents, with inflated property value for the purpose of obtaining more loan sums than what ought to have been. In its attempt to prove fraud the respondent relied on the evidence of Koe Chong Jin (DW1). DW1 was the head of the Fraud and Investigation Unit of the respondent who had investigated the alleged perpetration of fraud. His evidence on fraud may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In respect of the finding of fraud the learned trial judge summarised her conclusion as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant submitted that the learned trial judge's finding on the issue of fraud was clearly erroneous as the respondent failed to establish fraud because it did not discharge its burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The respondent merely relied on hearsay evidence. On the other hand, the respondent however submitted that they had discharged the said burden by calling DW1. It is the respondent's case that DW1 was the investigator who took certain steps in the investigation. The respondent contended that DW1's oral evidence was based upon compilation of information received by him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The respondent urged the court not to disturb the learned trial judge's finding as the same was based on her assessment of the credibility of the witnesses for whom she had the distinct advantages of seeing and hearing from the witness box.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that, if it is a question of credibility, then this court would surely hesitate before it overrules the findings of the learned trial judge. It is however clearly not a question of credibility that had arisen, but it is a question of admissibility of evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The rule against hearsay is found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;60.;;">s 60 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> which read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> As we have earlier alluded to, the respondent relied on DW1's evidence to prove fraud. It is clear that his oral testimony and his findings that "there were fraudulent transactions" were based on interviews with the agents, valuers and the purchasers. They were not from or within his own knowledge. The truthfulness and accuracy of the words spoken by the interviewees cannot be tested through cross-examination. The interviewees were not called to give evidence to prove the truth of the matter. In other words to prove fraud, the relevant interviewees must be called to testify on the relevant documents that were alleged to be false and/or forged as well as explain how the fraud was carried out. They would be the persons most competent to describe with certainty the nature of the documents and the truth of their contents. This court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2012_564;"><i>SPM Membrane Switch Sdn Bhd v. Kerajaan Negeri Selangor</i> [2012] MLRAU 564</LINK>; [2014] 5 CLJ 154 held that an audit report (Laporan Audit 2003) remains a hearsay evidence unless the maker is called upon to explain its meaning. By comparison to an independent audit report as in the above case, the investigation report by DW1 in the instant appeal is merely an internal investigation report, lacks independence and thereby of lower probative value than an independent audit report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Thus from the evidentiary point of view, DW1's oral evidence in respect of the fraud is therefore hearsay and clearly inadmissible. The learned trial judge ought to have rejected DW1's evidence in respect of the fraud. Any reference to statements made in the interviews and documents referred to therein are inadmissible and cannot be taken as evidence to prove fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The next issue to be determined is whether the improper admission of evidence is by itself sufficient reason for allowing this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The answer is provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;167.;;">s 167 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> that reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As can be gleaned from the above section, the test to determine whether or not the judgment of the High Court should be reversed or altered on account of wrongful admission of DW1's evidence is whether or not without that evidence there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_342;"><i>Juraimi Husin v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 342</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 537; [1998] 2 CLJ 383; [1998] 1 AMR 758].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Applying the test to the facts of the present case, we are of the view that stripped of the hearsay evidence, there is not a shred of other evidence to sustain the finding on fraud. The allegation of fraud by the respondent has not been established as the respondent has not discharged the burden of proving fraud beyond reasonable doubt. That being the case, the learned trial judge has erred in her finding of fraud on the basis that the appellant did not adduce evidence to rebut fraud. No such burden had arisen in the first place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Letter Of Undertaking</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge had wrongly construed the Letters of Undertaking. According to the counsel, the respondent is not abrogated from performing its obligations pursuant to the Letters of Undertaking after the preconditions in the undertaking have been satisfied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Now, the principles of construction to be applied to the undertakings are similar to those applied to an ordinary contract. The intentions of the parties are to be gathered from the language used (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_181;"><i>Michael C Solle v. United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 181</LINK>; [1986] 1 MLJ 45; [1984] 1 CLJ 267). This court, in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_163;"><i>Federal Flour Mills Bhd v. Fima Palmbulk Services Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 163</LINK>; [2005] 6 MLJ 525; [2005] 4 CLJ 47; [2005] 6 AMR 345, made reference to the case of <i>Re Strand Music Hall Co Ltd</i> [1865] 35 Beav 153 and cited with approval the observation made by Sir John Romily, Master of the Rolls at p 856 on the construction of a written instrument:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The conditions in the Letters of Undertaking to be satisfied by the appellant before the respondent bank performs its undertaking are as set out below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In this instance case, upon perusing the words and operative terms used in the undertaking from the respondent to the appellant, we are of the opinion that the intentions of the parties are clear. The respondent undertook to release the sum to the appellant upon the appellant satisfying conditions laid down by the bank in the letters.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Based upon the evidence on record, we are indeed satisfied that all preconditions have been satisfied. We are in agreement with the appellant's counsel that upon true construction of the respondent's Letters of Undertaking, the respondent was under a contractual obligation with the appellant to release the balance of the purchase price.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We would venture on to say that on the facts of the present case, the Letters of Undertaking emanate from the loan agreements. The undertaking is an agreement or a promise by the respondent to pay the appellant on behalf of the purchasers/borrowers under the sale and purchase agreements and pursuant to the loan agreements. The sums to be paid thereunder are comprised in the loan amounts, as between the appellant and purchasers, as well as the balance of the purchase prices, as between the purchasers and the appellant. For that reason, we are of the view that the Letters of Undertakings are inextricably linked to the loan agreements as well as the sale and purchase agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Since fraud has not been proven there is no reason why the respondent should not honour the Letters of Undertaking issued pursuant to the loan agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It is settled law that an appellate court will not interfere with the trial court's decision unless it can be demonstrated that the trial court is guilty of insufficient judicial appreciation of evidence (see <i>UEM Group Bhd v. Genisys Integrated Engineers Pte Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 2 MLRA 668 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_260;"><i>China Airlines Ltd v. Maltran Air Corp Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 260</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 517; [1996] 3 CLJ 163; [1996] 1 AMR 2233). Based upon the above reasons, we find that this is a fitting case warranting appellate intervention. In our view, the learned trial judge had erred and had improperly admitted hearsay evidence when deciding against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We, therefore, allow the appeal with costs fixed at RM40,000.00 here and below. Deposits to be refunded to the appellant. We set aside the decision of the High Court.</p>
