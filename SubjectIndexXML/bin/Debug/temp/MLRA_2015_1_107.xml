    <p>These appeals stemmed from a dispute involving a solicitor-client relationship. The 1st appellant was an advocate and solicitor whilst the 2nd appellant was his firm. The respondents were his clients. The subject matter was over certain estate land which the respondents claimed to have agreed to purchase and towards which they had made some deposit payments. Their claim was based on agreements the respondents and a few other purchasers transacted with a company called Syarikat Pembinaan Perusahaan Kemajuan Berhad ('SPPKB'). SPPKB could not be registered as the owner of the estate land due to technicalities although it paid a substantial sum towards the purchase price with the vendor of the estate land. The monies paid by SPPKB to acquire the estate land were held on trust by the said vendor. The estate land was subsequently transferred to a company named Simpang Empat Plantation Sdn Bhd ('the 3rd appellant'), which was specifically formed for that purpose. The 3rd appellant defaulted in payments towards a loan it had taken with the 5th appellant, which resulted in the estate land going for auction. At risk of losing their interests in the estate land, the respondents and the other purchasers formed a Pro-tem Committee ('Committee') and approached the 2nd appellant through the 1st appellant in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor to secure their interests in the estate land, to which the 1st appellant agreed to render his professional services. The events that followed showed that the auction of the estate land proceeded and that the 1st appellant after a second attempt, made a bidding for the estate land in his name. It transpired that the 1st appellant subsequently informed the purchasers in a meeting held with them that he was not their lawyer anymore and that the estate land was now his land. He suggested, amongst others, that the purchasers purchase their allotted shares or plots from him. In the interim, he set up the 4th appellant company in which he transferred the ownership of the estate land. He later transferred his shares in the 4th appellant to two unrelated companies. The respondents, unhappy with the outcome of their case, filed this action against the appellants at the High Court. The learned judge dismissed their claim, which decision was overturned on appeal by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. Hence, the present appeals by the appellants. The appellants argued that the respondents through the Committee had only retained the 1st appellant for a limited purpose, namely, to secure the letter from the 3rd appellant to recognise the SPPKB agreements and for the entry of the caveats on the estate land in anticipation of the public auction sale. The biddings for the estate land by the 1st appellant were outside the scope of the retainer. Five questions were posed before the Federal Court, out of which three were of relevance herein: (i) whether the existence of, and scope of duties in, a solicitor-client relationship were to be determined only by reference to the retainer; (ii) whether a fiduciary was entitled to restitution of expenditure incurred in securing a benefit subsequently determined to be due and payable to persons to whom the fiduciary owed duties; and (iii) whether a court was entitled to lift the corporate veil of a company in order to do justice despite it not being the pleaded or argued case of the claimants that the company concerned was used as an engine of fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeals:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was a matter of evidence to determine whether a solicitor-client relationship existed. Such evidence adduced included the words and conduct of the parties towards each other. Where a solicitor-client relationship had come about, a retainer could then be said to exist, express or by implication. It was not essential that the retainer must be in writing. It might be oral or implied by the conduct of the parties in the particular case. The principle enunciated in <i>Underwood, Son &amp; Piper v. Lewis</i> was applicable. (paras 38-45)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was, in the present case, a solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers, which included the respondents. The relationship was not limited for the purposes as alleged by the 1st and 2nd appellants. If the 1st appellant wanted to limit the solicitor-client relationship he could have easily indicated it to the purchasers or to any of the members of the Committee. A limited retainer should be reduced in writing to avoid any misunderstanding. Otherwise a solicitor upon being retained expressly or impliedly was expected, unless earlier and properly discharged, to take all the necessary steps to carry it on till the end. If it was true that the relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers stopped on or just before the first bid, there was no reasonable explanation given by the 1st appellant as to why he continued to have any dealing with the relevant member of the Committee even past the second bid. He also required the purchasers to contribute to the required deposit for the second auction bid. (paras 46-50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Although the 1st appellant made the second bid for the estate land on his own accord, the 1st appellant did not deny that the Committee first approached him on the basis of his status as an advocate and solicitor. While the 1st appellant claimed that he was only the solicitor for the purchasers to secure the acknowledgment by the 3rd appellant of the SPPKB agreements and the entry of caveats, it was only in a subsequent meeting with the purchasers that he declared to them that he was not their solicitor. (paras 51-52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was no indication of any suspension or termination of the solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers. Any suspension or termination of a solicitor-client relationship should have been expressly stated or could be implied from the evidence adduced. It would therefore be reasonable to consider that the solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers continued to subsist until the 1st appellant declared or announced to the purchasers in the relevant meeting that he was no longer their solicitor. If his denial of being the solicitor of the purchasers had any validity despite the facts and circumstances indicating to the contrary, his late denial should not have any retrospective effect. (para 53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The sole objective of the Committee in seeking for the professional services of the 1st appellant was to ensure that the claims of the purchasers in the estate land were secured. The SPPKB agreements gave the purchasers their claims over a substantial portion of the estate land. The 1st appellant also acknowledged such claims of the purchasers on the estate land and took steps to meet the legitimate expectation of the purchasers. The 1st appellant also caused caveats to be entered on the estate land. The 1st appellant recognised and accepted that the purchasers had caveatable interests in the estate land. Therefore, it was clear that the 1st appellant carried out his undertaking in a way that gave rise to an understanding or expectation in a reasonable person that he would behave in a particular way. There was a legitimate expectation by the purchasers that the 1st appellant would act in their interests. The Committee did not approach the 1st appellant for some entirely different transaction. Further, the 1st appellant first obtained his information about the estate land from the Committee representing the purchasers and there was no evidence adduced, express or implied, that the solicitor-client relationship was terminated or even suspended when the 1st appellant made his auction bids for the estate land. (paras 62-63)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The 1st appellant owed a fiduciary obligation to the purchasers in connection with the estate land at all material times. As such, the issue of a limited retainer between him and the purchasers did not arise. The 1st appellant should have acted in good faith. As a fiduciary, the 1st appellant should not have made a profit out of his trust by reason of his fiduciary office. He should not have placed himself in a position where his duty and his interest conflicted. He should not have acted for his own benefit or the benefit of any third person without the informed consent of his principals, in this case the purchasers, which included the respondents. In doing what he did, the 1st appellant breached his fiduciary obligation to them, thus an indication of his disloyalty or infidelity. (para 64)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The 1st appellant, in breach of his fiduciary duty, had unjustly enriched himself. Hence, he must account for the profit and other advantages he acquired while acting in breach of his fiduciary obligation towards the purchasers. It would be unconscionable to allow him to keep the profit and other advantages he made as a result of his acquisition of the estate land. However, it would be inequitable for the purchasers to take the whole of the estate land and/or profit without incurring expenses to obtain them. The 1st appellant obtained the whole estate land, including the portions identified to be the plots or as represented in the form of shares to which the purchasers laid their claims to be beneficially entitled. Since not all the purchasers were parties in this case, the plots and shares claimed by the respondents were only of relevance herein. The 1st appellant must therefore pay the respondents damages to be assessed. When doing the assessment, the value of the respondents' shares must be taken into account. Further to be taken into account when assessing the damages were the profits flowing from the sale of the estate land to be adjusted according to the acreage representing the respondents' shares. However, the expenditure incurred by the 1st appellant must be deducted from the assessed damages and profits. (paras 77-80)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Although parties were confined to the pleadings and the court was not entitled to decide a suit on a matter that had not been pleaded, in some instances, evidence adduced during the hearing could overcome the defects in pleadings as long as the opposing party was not taken by surprise. More so if such evidence when given without any objection by the opposing party would further have the effect of curing the absence of such plea in the relevant pleading. In the present case, the evidence relating to the issue of whether the 3rd appellant and SPPKB were one and the same entity and whether the 1st appellant was the alter ego of the 4th appellant was given without any objection from the appellants. (paras 89-92)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> It was not necessary to deal with the issue of the actual lifting of the corporate veil. However, it was now a settled law in Malaysia that the court would lift the corporate veil of a corporation if the corporation was set up for fraudulent purposes or established to avoid an existing obligation or to prevent the abuse of a corporate legal personality. The facts and circumstances in the present case justified the lifting of the corporate veil of the 4th appellant to establish that the 4th appellant was the alter ego of the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant set up the 4th appellant as a mere façade to facilitate the transfer of ownership of the estate land in order to evade his fiduciary obligation as the solicitor towards his clients, the purchasers, including the respondents. (paras 95-102)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> Liabilities might be imposed against the 1st and 2nd appellants but excluding the other appellants. Thus, the lifting of the corporate veil of the 4th appellant did not necessarily mean that liability must be attached to it. In this case the 4th appellant was no longer under the control of the 1st appellant. He had disposed of his shares in the 4th appellant as well as the shares of those who were closely associated with him. The estate land although registered in the name of the 4th appellant was now under the management of two companies having no ties with the 1st or 2nd appellants. They were not parties to this action. There was no assertion by the respondents that those two companies did not acquire those shares in good faith and for valuable consideration from the 1st appellant and the other shareholders. There was also no challenge to the fact that those two companies had expended monies to develop the estate land up to the present condition. It would therefore be inequitable for the purchasers to take the estate land and/or profit without incurring expenses to obtain them. Accordingly, no order was made to declare the transfer of the estate land to the 4th appellant as invalid, null and void. (paras 103-105)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> As for the 3rd appellant, now in liquidation, it lost the estate land not on its own volition but on forced sale by auction being the consequence of its default in servicing its loan with the 5th appellant. It would serve no purpose to lift its corporate veil or to make any order against it. The receivers and managers were only exercising the powers contained in the relevant debenture. There was no allegation of misconduct on their part. Further, the estate land was now under the control of two companies that had no link to the scheme of the 1st appellant when he acquired the estate land. It would therefore be inequitable and unconscionable to now order the two companies to relinquish their interests in the estate land after expending monies to develop it. (para 106)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> As for the 5th appellant, the allegation made that the 5th appellant had actual knowledge of the presence of the purchasers on the estate land was mere conjecture, not founded on any factual basis. As such, the 5th appellant did not have any notice of the purchasers' alleged beneficial interests. In any event the loan with the 5th appellant had been settled with the auction of the estate land. As such the 5th appellant might at worse be liable on the basis of indemnity. However that was not an issue herein. (paras 108-109)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard Malanjum CJSS:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This case has a checkered history. It first came before this court for leave to appeal pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 ('the Act')</LINK>. It was refused. The appellants applied for a review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1995_376;137.;;">r 137 of the Rules of the Federal Court 1995</LINK>. Despite being sparingly exercised this court ruled 'that this is another rare but an appropriate case for the exercise of the inherent power of this court as envisaged in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1995_376;137.;;">r 137</LINK>'. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_95;"><i>Gurbachan Singh Bagawan Singh &amp; Anor v. Vellasamy Pennusamy &amp; Ors &amp; Other Applications</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 95</LINK>; [2012] 2 MLJ 149; [2012] 2 CLJ 663; [2012] 2 AMR 403.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Upon re-hearing of the leave application this court granted leave and allowed five Leave questions for consideration ('the Leave Questions'). They are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The Leave Questions may be categorised into two parts. Questions 1 and 2 deal with the relationship between the 1st and 2nd appellants and the respondents. Questions 3 to 5 deal with the claims of the respondents on the estate land. In our view Questions 1 and 2 may be determined on their own merits. They are not dependent on the determination of Questions 3 to 5. Nevertheless the status of the estate land at all material times may be relevant in the assessment of damages should liability be found against the 1st appellant and 2nd appellants after considering Questions 1 and 2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In this judgment, unless stated otherwise, any reference to purchasers includes the respondents but not <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> This case involves a dispute between clients, the respondents and their erstwhile solicitor, the 1st appellant and his firm, the 2nd appellant. The other three appellants may be conveniently described as incidentals to the dispute. The subject matter was over an estate land which the respondents claimed to have agreed to purchase and had made some deposit payments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In their action filed in July 1994 the respondents prayed for the following relief as summarised by the learned trial judge:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The facts and the chronology of events including the relevant documentary evidence in this case have already been succinctly elaborated, analysed and reproduced in the judgments of the trial High Court, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2006_1_101;"><i>Vellasamy Ponnusamy &amp; Ors v. Gurbachan Singh Bagawan Singh &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRH 101</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 715; [2006] 1 CLJ 805; [2006] 3 AMR 58 and the Court of Appeal <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_5_447;"><i>Vellasamy Pennusamy &amp; Ors v. Gurbachan Singh Bagawan Singh &amp; Ors</i> [2009] 5 MLRA 447</LINK>; [2010] 5 MLJ 437; [2012] 2 CLJ 712. We need not regurgitate them in this judgment. Suffice it if we only highlight the pertinent facts and circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Nam Bee Rubber Estate Sdn Bhd ("Nam Bee") was the registered proprietor of a large parcel of land measuring 3681.165 acres (about 1490 hectares) known as PN 35553 Lot 9108, Mukim Hutan Melintang, Hilir Perak ("the estate land"). Since it was a rubber estate land <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the National Land Code ('NLC')</LINK> was applicable to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In December 1979 a company, Syarikat Pembinaan Perusahaan Kemajuan Berhad ("SPPKB") proposed to buy the estate land. The agreed sale price was RM3,204,080.00 (subsequently it was agreed at RM3,520,000.00 as seen in 'P41'). It paid a deposit of RM51,000.00 to Tan Ann Loong ('Tan') a director of Nam Bee (the receipt of payment 'P38').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Upon inquiry with the Land Office SPPKB found out that the estate land could not be transferred to it. SPPKB and Nam Bee did not have common directors. Meanwhile, on 18 December 1981 Tan signed a Declaration of Trust ('P40') that bound and declared him as a Trustee for all the monies paid by SPPKB to acquire the estate land. At that point in time SPPKB had already paid a sum of RM1,161,224.00 to Nam Bee towards the purchase price. However no evidence was adduced to show that SPPKB had paid the balance of the purchase price to Nam Bee. In any event SPPKB was never registered as the owner of the estate land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Subsequently, Nam Bee incorporated Simpang Empat Plantation Sdn Bhd ('SEP'), the 3rd appellant, with its initial directors common with Nam Bee's. The estate land was thus transferred to SEP on or about 29 October 1984. The directors of SEP were then replaced with the directors of SPPKB. Mr Renganathan (SP8) assumed the position as the Managing Director of SEP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> From 1979 to 1984 SPPKB entered into separate agreements ('SPPKB agreements') with different purchasers including the respondents purportedly to sell either in the form of shares or plots in the estate land at a purchase price ranging from RM3,500.00 to RM5,000.00 per acre. In order to meet the obligations under the SPPKB agreements the estate land was supposed to be subdivided. In respect of the sale of shares, each share was pegged to the size of 3 acres in the estate land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Under the SPPKB agreements, SPPKB as the vendor agreed to develop the infrastructure and to develop and manage the estate land into a palm oil estate within 48 months with the purchasers sharing in the produce based on their respective shares or plots. On their part, the purchasers were required to pay the deposits for their purchase prices and that the balance sums would have to be settled within 48 months partly in cash and partly in kind, namely, by deducting 60% of 'the sale of produce harvested each time'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Of the many purchasers involved in the SPPKB agreements only 217 are listed as the respondents in this case. Neither Nam Bee nor SEP were parties to the SPPKB agreements. Further, the purchasers only bought a total of about 3000 acres of the estate land. The balance remained with SEP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> To raise funds SEP borrowed from Maybank a sum RM500,000.00 in 1985 and an overdraft facility of RM500,000.00. However, it was still not sufficient. In December 1990 SEP borrowed from MBF Finance ('the 5th appellant') a sum of RM2,500,000.00 to enable the rehabilitation of the estate land and to repay the loan with Maybank. In order to secure the new loan a charge and a debenture were created by SEP in favour of the 5th appellant without the knowledge of the purchasers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Unfortunately, SEP defaulted in the repayment of the loan with the 5th appellant. As a result the 5th appellant, in the exercise of its rights under the debenture appointed Messrs Ernst &amp; Young as the R&amp;M to manage the affairs of SEP with Dato' Robert Lim (SD12) as the person in charge. SD12 then appointed Suppiah (SP13) to assist him. The R&amp;M found out that SEP had no business activities and thus had no income to pay its debt which was by then about RM3,800,000.00 or RM3,900,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Furthermore, SP13 reported to SD12 that there were a few squatters on the estate land. SD12 decided to sell the estate land by way of auction pursuant to the powers under the debenture. A notice to that effect was published in the newspapers. The auction was scheduled on 8 September 1992.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In August 1992 the purchasers became aware that the estate land was going to be put up for Sale by Tender. They also knew that an R&amp;M had been appointed. In order to address their predicament the purchasers set up a Pro-tem Committee ('the Committee'). The Committee approached the 2nd appellant through the 1st appellant in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor. The 1st appellant contacted SP13 and was briefly informed of the matter regarding the sale of the estate land. SP13 assured the 1st appellant that he would obtain the necessary documents on the same and revert to him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In view of the perceived urgency of the matter, the 1st appellant applied for a Registrar's Caveat to be entered on the estate land. The Registrar's Caveat was entered on 28 August 1992. The 1st appellant also entered and assisted in the entry of private caveats on the estate land by a few of the purchasers. SP13 subsequently reverted to the 1st appellant. It became apparent to the 1st appellant that the Sale by Tender scheduled for 8 September 1992 could not be stopped and he duly informed the Committee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On 30 August 1992 the 1st appellant was invited to attend a meeting at Simpang Empat in the office of SP8 by Tan Tang Seong (SD7) a member of the Committee. During that meeting the 1st appellant met SP8 and inquired about the auction. SP8 assured the 1st appellant and those present that the sale would not go on as he had procured the necessary funds to pay the 5th appellant. SP8 showed the 1st appellant and those present a cheque drawn in favour of the 5th appellant for the amount of RM3,500,000.00. On the request of the 1st appellant SP8 issued a letter drafted by the 1st appellant that SEP would recognize the SPPKB agreements. The 1st appellant also told the purchasers not to worry and that the sale would not go on.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Shortly before the auction was to take place it became clear to the purchasers that SP8 had failed to settle the outstanding loan of the 3rd appellant with the 5th appellant and that the sale of the estate land would therefore go on as scheduled. The Committee again approached the 1st appellant and informed him of what they had learnt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On 8 September 1992 the auction of the estate land proceeded. The 1st appellant came to bid for it in his own name at the price of RM4,000,000.00. His bid was accepted. The 10% deposit amounting to RM400,000.00 was duly paid by the 1st appellant with the assistance from his friends. However, the sale could not go through as an injunction was obtained by SEP through SP8 to stop the sale. The deposit paid was therefore refunded to the 1st appellant. On 23 December 1993 the injunction was set aside. Once again the R&amp;M called for the Sale by Tender of the estate land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> On 30 January 1994 SD7 and the 1st respondent together with some other purchasers went to see the 1st appellant. Arising from that meeting the 1st appellant went again to bid for the estate land for RM4,850,000.00. It was not in dispute that at request of the 1st appellant some of the purchasers paid the sum of RM276,450.00 being their contributions towards the deposit payment for the auction bid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On 7 March 1994 the 1st appellant was informed that his second bid was successful.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On 17 March 1994 the 1st appellant wrote to all the purchasers (listed in P42) informing them of the successful bid. The 1st appellant therefore invited the purchasers to buy their allotted shares or plots from him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The 1st appellant held meetings with the purchasers on the 2nd and 3rd of April 1994 (as recorded in D78 and D80 respectively). During the 3rd April meeting the 1st appellant for the first time told the purchasers that he was not their lawyer and that the estate land was his land. The genuine purchasers would have to buy back their portions of the estate land from the 1st appellant on the basis of the supposed balances due to SPPKB. He suggested to the purchasers that they purchased their allotted shares or plots from him and he drew up a proposed sale and purchase agreement to be entered by them with him. On hearing this, the purchasers were not too pleased. They alleged that to their understanding the 1st appellant was their solicitor when he made the bid for the estate land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Meanwhile, the 1st appellant proceeded to set up the 4th appellant with him, his wife and a friend by the name of Manjeet as the directors. The 1st appellant then transferred the ownership of the estate land to the 4th appellant on 15 October 1994. The 1st appellant had since transferred his shares in the 4th appellant to two companies, namely, Lien Hoe Xing Sdn Bhd and Jugra Palm Oil Mill Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> As there was no agreement reached between the purchasers and the 1st appellant the respondents proceeded to file this case at the Ipoh High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>In The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> After a full trial the learned High Court trial judge adjudged for the appellants. The learned trial judge held, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>In The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The Court of Appeal was split in its decision with the majority ('the majority') in favour of the respondents. It reversed the decision of the learned trial judge and granted the declarations prayed for by the respondents. The court also awarded RM50,000.00 costs to the respondents and ordered for an account and inquiry to be held on to the use of the estate land by the 1st and/ or the 4th appellants, the profits thereby derived and such profits to be paid to the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The majority found, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The minority judgment ('the minority') found in favour of the appellants and upheld the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>'Whether The Existence Of, And Scope Of Duties In, A Solicitor-Client Relationship Is To Be Determined Only By Reference To The Retainer'</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In respect of Question 1 it was contended by learned counsel for the 1st appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In response learned counsel for the respondents submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Finding For Question 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It is trite law that in an action against a solicitor by his or her erstwhile client the threshold issue is whether a solicitor-client relationship exists between the plaintiff-client and the defendant-solicitor. In the absence of such relationship the defendant-solicitor in his professional capacity owes no duty to the plaintiff-client. See: <i>Rabiah Bee bte Mohamed Ibrahim v. Salem Ibrahim</i> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 655.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Solicitor-Client Relationship</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> A solicitor-client relationship may arise either:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Where it is to be implied it is for the purported client in an action against a solicitor to prove the existence of a solicitor-client relationship between them. Proof of such relationship requires an objective consideration of all the facts and circumstances in order to come to a reasonable conclusion:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It is therefore a matter of evidence to determine whether a solicitor-client relationship exists. Hence, it is essential to consider such evidence adduced including the words and conduct of the parties towards each other. It is also to be noted that fee arrangement or payment is not determinative of the existence of a solicitor-client relationship. Take for instance the case of the Minnesota woman who met a lawyer for less than an hour to consult on a possible claim for medical negligence. At that point in time only 10 months was left before limitation would set in. No fee arrangement or authorisation to act was discussed. But the woman was left with the impression that her case was weak and that the lawyer would consult with others to discuss the case, only getting back to her if she had a viable claim. The woman did not hear from the lawyer even after a year past. So she consulted another lawyer but only to find that the statute of limitation had set in. The first lawyer was ultimately found liable and was ordered to pay a sum that the woman would have received if she had timely proceeded with her case. See: <i>Togstad v. Vesely, Otto, Miller &amp; Keefe</i>, 291 NW2d 686 (Minn 1980). But unilateral belief by a purported client that the solicitor would represent him or her would not suffice. <i>Rabiah Bee bte Mohamed Ibrahim v. Salem Ibrahim (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In <i>Messrs Yong &amp; Co v. Wee Hood Teck Development Corp Ltd(1) (supra)</i> the then Federal Court agreed with the approach taken by the learned trial judge and held that 'there was ample evidence on record for the learned judge to conclude that a retainer came into existence by implication and as amplified by the conduct of the parties which showed a course of dealings giving rise to legal obligations and establishing the relationship of solicitor and client.' (See also: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_391;"><i>Datuk Jagindar Singh &amp; Ors v. Tara Rajaratnam</i> [1983] 1 MLRA 391</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 196).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Accordingly, where the evidence adduced including the words and conduct that transpired between a solicitor and a client determines that a solicitor-client relationship has come about, a retainer can then be said to exist, express or by implication. It is therefore not necessarily the existence of an express retainer that determines the existence of a solicitor-client relationship.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It has been held that 'the giving of instructions by a client to a solicitor constitutes the solicitor's retainer by that client. It is not essential that the retainer must be in writing. It may be oral. It may be implied by the conduct of the parties in the particular case'. See: <i>Fladgate LLP v. Lee Harrison</i> [2012] EWHC 67 (QB)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Indeed it should be noted that a 'retainer' in relation to solicitor-client relationship can be at least in three forms, namely, the payment of certain amount of money to the solicitor to be placed in trust accounts or a professional relationship that culminated between a solicitor and a client under given facts and circumstances or an agreement the existence of which depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Once a solicitor-client relationship exists and thus a retainer, it 'put into operation the normal terms of the contractual relationship including in particular the duty' of the solicitor 'to protect the interests' of his client 'in matters to which the retainer relates by all proper means'. See: <i>Messrs Yong &amp; Co v. Wee Hood Teck Development Corp Ltd (1) (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> It was also held in <i>Underwood, Son &amp; Piper v. Lewis</i> [1894] 2 QB 306 per Lord Esher MR; (See also: <i>Cawdery Kaye Fireman &amp; Taylor v. Gary Minkin</i> [2012] EWCA Civ 546; <i>Richard Buxton (Solicitors) v. Huw Llewelyn Paul Mills- Owen</i> [2010] EWCA Civ 122):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> There is no reason why the foregoing principle cannot be applied with equal force to other services rendered by a solicitor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Reverting to the present case, in his submission before this court learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd appellants did not dispute that there was solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers. However, he went on to say that the purchasers through the Committee only retained the 1st appellant for a limited purpose, namely, to secure the letter from the 3rd appellant to recognise the SPPKB agreements and for the entry of the caveats on the estate land in anticipation of the public auction sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> With respect, having considered the evidence adduced in this case and the submissions of learned counsel for the parties, we are inclined to agree with the majority that there was definitely a solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers including the respondents. And the relationship was not limited for those purposes as mentioned by learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> If indeed the 1st appellant wanted to limit the solicitor-client relationship he could have easily indicated it to the purchasers or to any of the members of the Committee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> It is a settled law as stated by the majority that a limited retainer should be reduced in writing to avoid any misunderstanding. See: <i>Lie Hendri Rusli v. Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim</i> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 594 Otherwise a solicitor upon being retained expressly or impliedly is expected, unless earlier and properly discharged, 'to take all the necessary steps' 'to carry it on till the end'. See: <i>Cawdery Kaye Fireman &amp; Taylor v. Gary Minkin</i> [2012] EWCA Civ 546.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> If it was true that the relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers stopped on or just before the first bid, there was no reasonable explanation given by the 1st appellant why he continued to have any dealing with SD7 who was a member of the Committee even past the second bid. He also required the purchasers to contribute to the required deposit for the second auction bid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The learned trial judge opined that D71 and D72A indicated that the 1st appellant made the second bid for the estate land on his own accord. With respect D71 and D72A should be read in the context that the 1st appellant did not deny that the Committee first approached him on the basis of his status as an advocate and solicitor. And while the 1st appellant claimed that he was only the solicitor for the purchasers to secure the acknowledgment by SEP of the SPPKB agreements and the entry of caveats, it was only in D80 that he declared to the purchasers that he was not their solicitor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> As such there is thus no merit in the submission by learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd appellants that had the majority considered the contemporaneous documents D71, D72A, D78 and D80, they would have come to a different conclusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Contrary to the contention marshaled for the 1st appellant, the earlier documents D71, D72A and even D78 did not indicate any suspension or termination of the solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers. Any suspension or termination of a solicitor-client relationship should have been expressly stated. See: <i>Cawdery Kaye Fireman &amp; Taylor v. Gary Minkin (supra)</i> or could be implied from the evidence adduced. There was none in this case. In fact it was to the contrary as discussed above. Thus, it would therefore be reasonable to consider that the solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers continued to subsist until the 1st appellant declared or announced to the purchasers as recorded in D80 that he was no longer their solicitor. See: <i>French v. Carter Lemon Camerons LLP</i> [2012] EWCA Civ 1180. At any rate even assuming that his denial of being the solicitor of the purchasers has any validity despite the facts and circumstances indicating to the contrary, his late denial should not have any retrospective effect. See: <i>Fladgate LLP v. Lee Harrison (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Fiduciary Duty In Solicitor-Client Relationship</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> 'For a person to be a fiduciary he must first and foremost have bound himself in some way to protect and/or to advance the interests of another. This is perhaps the most obvious of the characteristics of the fiduciary office for Equity will only oblige a person to act in what he believes to be another's interests if he himself has assumed a position which requires him to act for or on behalf of that other in some particular matter'. See: <i>Professor PD Finn: Fiduciary Obligations</i> (1977). Thus, the essential element is that there must be some undertaking on the part of the fiduciary to act with loyalty in the interest of the other party. 'A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence.' See: <i>Bristol and West Building Society v. Mothew (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The categories of fiduciary relationship are not closed. Indeed it was said that it was doubtful 'if it is fruitful to attempt to make a general statement of the circumstances in which a fiduciary relationship will be found to exist. Fiduciary relations are of different types, carrying different obligations ... and a test which might seem appropriate to determine whether a fiduciary relationship existed for one purpose might be quite inappropriate for another purpose. For example, the relation of physician and patient, and priest and penitent, may be described as fiduciary when the question is whether there is a presumption of undue influence, but may be less likely to be relevant when an alleged conflict between duty and interest is in question. Moreover, different fiduciary relationships may entail different consequences, as is shown by the discussion of the respective positions of a trustee and a partner in relation to the renewal of a lease.' See: <i>Hospital Products Ltd v. United States Surgical Corp &amp; Ors</i> [1984] 58 ALJR 587. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that there are two main circumstances in which fiduciary relationships arise, namely, <i>per se</i> fiduciary (status-based fiduciary) and ad hoc fiduciary (fact-based fiduciary).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> A solicitor-client relationship comes within the ambit of per se fiduciary because of 'their inherent purpose or their presumed factual or legal incidents'. See: <i>Lac Minerals Ltd v. International Corona Resources Ltd</i>, [1989] 2 SCR 574. However, as alluded to above, all fiduciary relationships, whether ad hoc or per se, must depend on the fiduciary agreeing to act loyally in the interest of the beneficiary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> A 'claim for breach of fiduciary duty may only be founded on breaches of the specific obligations imposed because the relationship is one characterised as fiduciary'. It is 'not every legal claim arising out of a <i>per se</i> fiduciary relationship, such as that between a solicitor and client, will give rise to a claim for a breach of fiduciary duty'. See: <i>Galambos v. Perez</i> [2009 SCC 48].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Indeed a breach of duty by a solicitor is not necessarily a breach of fiduciary duty though a claim for negligence may arise. See: <i>Bristol and West Building Society v. Mothew (supra)</i>; <i>Hilton v. Barker Booth &amp; Eastwood</i> [2005] UKHL 8. Not every task undertaken in the course of a solicitor- client relationship attracts a fiduciary obligation. See: <i>Galambos v. Perez (supra)</i> It is only those duties that are peculiar to fiduciaries can properly be termed as fiduciary duties. See: <i>Breen v. Williams</i> [1996] 186 CLR 74 at 137.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The distinguishing duty of a fiduciary is the duty of loyalty. Lord Justice Millett said this <i>Bristol and West Building Society v. Mothew (supra)</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In the present case the gist of the submission of learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd appellants is that due to the limited retainer that defined the solicitor-client relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers, the biddings for the estate land by the 1st appellant were outside the scope of the retainer. As such the issue of any fiduciary obligation did not arise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> With respect, such submission completely ignored the basic fact that the Committee approached the 1st appellant as an advocate and solicitor. The Committee on behalf of the purchasers required the professional services of the 1st appellant in relation to the estate land. The 1st appellant agreed to render his professional services.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The sole objective of the Committee in seeking for the professional services of the 1st appellant was to ensure that the claims of the purchasers in the estate land were secured. The SPPKB agreements gave the purchasers their claims over a substantial portion of the estate land. This was affirmed in D14. Such claims in relation to the fiduciary duties of the 1st appellants towards the purchasers were not entirely dependent on them being holders of legal or equitable interests over the estate land. As stated earlier a 'claim for breach of fiduciary duty may only be founded on breaches of the specific obligations imposed because the relationship is one characterised as fiduciary'. In this case the evidence adduced and on the given facts and circumstances the relationship between the 1st appellant and the purchasers could only be properly characterised as fiduciary. The 1st appellant also acknowledged such claims of the purchasers on the estate land. In fact the 1st appellant took steps to meet the legitimate expectation of the purchasers such as drafting D14 and had it signed by SP8. The 1st appellant also caused caveats to be entered on the estate land. Obviously, the 1st appellant, being the solicitor, recognised and accepted that the purchasers had caveatable interest on the estate land. Thus, it was clear that the 1st appellant carried out his undertaking in a way that gave 'rise to an understanding or expectation in a reasonable person' that he 'would behave in a particular way'. See: J Edelman: "<i>When do fiduciary duties arise</i>?" (2010), vol 126, Law Quarterly Review, p 302. In other words, there was a legitimate expectation by the vulnerable purchasers that the 1st appellant, while armed with the power to act and discretion, would act in their interests. At no time the committee approached the 1st appellant for some entirely different transaction. See: <i>Longstaff and Ors v. Birtless and Ors</i> [2002] 1 WLR 470; See: <i>Galambos v. Perez (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The 1st appellant first obtained his information about the estate land from his clients, the Committee that represented the purchasers. And, as determined earlier, there was no evidence adduced express or even implied that the solicitor-client relationship was terminated or even suspended when the 1st appellant made his auction bids for the estate land. See: <i>Cawdery Kaye Fireman &amp; Taylor v. Gary Minkin (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Accordingly, at all material times there was fiduciary obligation of the 1st appellant towards the purchasers in connection with the estate land. As such the issue of a limited retainer between him and the purchasers did not arise. The 1st appellant should have acted in good faith. He should not have made profit out of his trust. Being a fiduciary the 1st appellant should not have made 'an unauthorised profit by reason or in virtue of the fiduciary office or otherwise within the scope of that fiduciary office'. See: <i>The Law Commission Paper on Fiduciary Duties of Investment Intermediaries</i> (2014) (Law Com No 350). He should not have placed himself in a position where his duty and his interest conflicted. He should not have acted for his own benefit or the benefit of any third person without the informed consent of his principals, in this case the purchasers. In doing what he did the 1st appellant breached his fiduciary obligation thus an indication of his 'disloyalty or infidelity'. See: <i>Bristol and West Building Society v. Mothew (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> For the foregoing reasons our answer to Question 1 is therefore in the negative if it relates to an assertion that the existence of a solicitor-client relationship is to be determined only by reference to an express retainer. For the reasons given above we find in this case that there was a solicitor-client relationship and thus a retainer between the 1st appellant as a solicitor, and by extension, the 2nd appellant as the solicitor's firm, and the purchasers as the clients. And arising from such relationship and for the reasons given above as well we also find that there was fiduciary duty of the 1st appellant, and by extension the 2nd appellant, towards the purchasers.</p>

      <b>Question 2:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether A Fiduciary Is Entitled To Restitution Of Expenditure Incurred In Securing A Benefit Subsequently Determined To Be Due And Payable To Persons Whom The Fiduciary Owes Duties?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Contentions Of The Parties</b>

      <b>[66]</b> In respect of Question 2 learned counsel for the 1st appellant submitted the following:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> In response, learned counsel for the respondents submitted thus:

    <p>
      <b>Finding For Question 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> As found earlier we agree with the majority that the 1st appellant was in a fiduciary position in relation to the purchasers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> It is trite law that a person in a fiduciary position is not entitled to make a profit and he is not allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and duty are in conflict. In <i>Phipps and Boardman</i> [1966] 3 WLR 1009, Lord Hodson explained the rule as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> Thus, the rule of equity is that if a person obtains a profit from his fiduciary position he is accountable for that profit. The liability arises from the mere fact of a profit having been made and that the fiduciary, however honest and well intentioned, cannot escape the risk of being called upon to account. This is how Lord Guest put it in <i>Phipps v. Boardman</i> [1966] 3 WLR 1009 at p 1060:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[71] While the Law Lords appeared to have laid down harsh consequences for breach of fiduciary duties in <i>Phipps v. Boardman</i> [1964] 1 WLR 993, p 1017 , the qualified orders made by the learned trial judge (Wilberforce J [as he then was]) were maintained. The learned trial judge ordered the defendants to account for the profit earned. But at the same time the learned trial judge ordered that the expenditure that was necessary to enable the profit to be realised and the allowance or credit for the work and skill of the defendants must also be taken into account. This is what the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords upheld the decision of the learned trial judge including the orders he made. However, Lord Denning MR, [1965] 2 WLR 839, p 861 in the Court of Appeal made this passing remark, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> In a subsequent case of <i>Guinnerss Plc v. Samaders</i> [1990] 2 AC 663 the House of Lords agreed with the proposition of law expounded in <i>Phipps v. Boardman</i> [1964] 1 WLR 993. Lord Goff of Chieveley while endorsing the rule that fiduciaries must not put themselves in a position where there is a conflict between their personal interests and their duties as fiduciaries, made reference to the decision of Wilberforce J with reservation. He said this, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Earlier on, in the case of <i>O'Sullivan v. Management Ltd</i> [1985] 1 QB 428 the Court of Appeal applied the principle of recompensing the fiduciaries as propounded in <i>Phipps v. Boardman</i> [1964] 1 WLR 993.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> In his judgment, with Dunn LJ in agreement, Fox LJ in dealing with the question of recompensing the defendants referred to the decision in <i>Phipps v. Boardman</i> [1964] 1 WLR 993 and held that there was in existence a necessary power in the court to make an allowance to the fiduciary without which substantial injustice might result. He said this, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> We find the approach employed by Fox FJ very useful and would apply it with appropriate modifications to the facts of this case before us. What we seek to do in this case is to give, within the court's discretion, relief to parties that is fair and just in the circumstances. As indicated by Lord Denning MR in <i>Phipps v. Boardman</i> [1964] 1 WLR 993 where there has been dishonesty or surreptitious dealing or other improper conduct, it might be appropriate to refuse but that will depend on the circumstances. In other words, the exercise of the discretion to refuse allowance to the fiduciary depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> In this case the purchasers entrusted the 1st appellant to get their portions of the estate land for them. Instead the 1st appellant took advantage of his position as a fiduciary. He was entrusted, after he managed to convince the purchasers during the meeting before the second auction, to bid for the estate land in his own name but only to subsequently claim that he did it on his own accord. Having obtained the whole estate land he transferred it to his company, the 4th appellant. The 1st appellant was in breach of his fiduciary duty. In so doing he had unjustly enriched himself. Hence, we hold that the 1st appellant must account for the profit and other advantages he acquired while acting in breach of his fiduciary obligations towards the purchasers. It would be unconscionable to allow him to keep the profit and other advantages he made as a result of his acquisition of the estate land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> However, it would be inequitable for the purchasers to take the whole of the estate land and/or profit without incurring expenses to obtain them. The 1st appellant obtained the whole estate land, including the portions identified to be the plots or as represented in the form of shares to which the purchasers laid their claims to be beneficially entitled. Since not all the purchasers are parties in this case only the plots and shares claimed by the respondents ('the respondents' shares') are therefore relevant in this judgment. The balance of 1500 hectares is also as well. It was not within the SPPKB agreements. But the estate land cannot be subdivided to enable separate titles to be given as the respondents' shares.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> The 1st appellant must therefore pay to the respondents damages to be assessed. When doing the assessment, the value of the respondents' shares must be taken into account. Indeed the respondents would have acquired their shares if not for the act of 'disloyalty or infidelity' on the part of the 1st appellant. Further to be taken into account when assessing the damages are the profits flowing from the sale of the estate land (to be adjusted according to acreage representing the respondents' shares).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> However, the expenditure incurred by the 1st appellant has to be deducted from the assessed damages and profits. To ascertain the damages and profits payable to the respondents an enquiry or assessment would have to be conducted by a High Court Judge preferably stationed in Ipoh High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> In the upshot our answer to Question 2 is therefore in the affirmative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether A Court Is Entitled To Lift The Corporate Veil Of A Company In Order To Do Justice Despite It Not Being The Pleaded Or Argued Case Of The Claimants That The Company Concerned Was Used As An Engine Of Fraud</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> In considering Question 3 it should be noted that the majority, on the ground of doing justice, exercised the power to lift the corporate veil of the 3rd and 4th appellants. The majority disagreed with the learned trial judge who declined to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In respect of the 3rd appellant, the majority held that it was incorporated solely for the purpose of enabling the transfer of the estate land from Nam Bee since the law did not allow a direct transfer from Nam Bee to SPPKB. As such there were compelling reasons to lift the corporate veil "where the justice of the case so demands". The majority thus held that the 3rd appellant and SPPKB should be treated as one and the same entity. The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1979_1_197;"><i>Hotel Jaya Puri Bhd v. National Union Of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers &amp; Anor</i> [1979] 1 MLRH 197</LINK>; [1980] 1 MLJ 109 was cited in support.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> As for the 4th appellant the majority held that it was the alter ego of the 1st appellant since it was incorporated to hold the estate land from the 1st appellant who had successfully bid for it. Meanwhile the 1st appellant knew all along the interests of the purchasers over a substantial portion of the estate land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Contentions Of The Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> Learned counsel for the 1st appellant submitted that the lifting of the corporate veil by the majority was wrong in law for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> Meanwhile learned counsel for the 4th appellant contended that the respondents should not be allowed to rely on the issue of corporate veil for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> In reply learned counsel for the respondents submitted thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Finding On Question 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> At the outset we note that Question 3 as posed is only on pleadings issue. It does not extend to the issue of whether the majority rightly lifted the corporate veil of the 3rd and 4th appellants. Thus, it would suffice for us to confine our answer to the pleadings issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> It is trite law that the parties are bound by their pleadings and the trial of a suit must confine to the pleadings. The court is not entitled to decide a suit on a matter that has not been pleaded. See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_327;"><i>Yew Wan Leong v. Lai Kok Chye</i> [1990] 1 MLRA 327</LINK>; [1990] 2 MLJ 152; [1990] 1 CLJ 330</p>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> However, in some instances, evidence adduced during the hearing can overcome the defects in pleadings as long as the other party is not taken by surprise. More so if 'Such evidence when given without any objection by the opposing party will further have the effect of curing the absence of such plea in the relevant pleading, in other words, the effect of overcoming such defect in such pleading'. See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_300;"><i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys, 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 300</LINK>; [1994] 3 MLJ 185; [1994] 3 CLJ 567; [1994] 3 AMR 1882</p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> In this case the respondents while conceding that issue on lifting the corporate veil of the companies was not pleaded argued that the evidence relating to the issue was adduced. As such the learned trial judge had erred in dismissing the issue on the ground that it was not pleaded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> We find the majority has dealt with the point quite succinctly. Having considered the evidence adduced by the respondents as highlighted by the majority, we are satisfied that evidence relating to the issue of whether the 3rd appellant and SPPKB were one and same entity and whether the 1st appellant was the alter ego of the 4th appellant had been given without any objection from the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> For instance, it was not a disputed fact and indeed evidence was adduced that the directors of SPPKB replaced the directors of Nam Bee as the directors of the 3rd appellant. That occurred soon after the estate land was transferred to the 3rd appellant. And in respect of the 4th appellant there was no denial and in fact the 1st appellant admitted that he was its director for a while.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> Hence, having considered the case for the respondents as a whole it could not be said that such evidence had departed radically from their pleaded case. Such evidence, in our view, had cured the absence of a specific plea of the aforementioned parties being one and same entities in the respondents' statement of claim. With respect we are therefore of the view that the learned trial judge should not have dismissed the issue on account of it being not pleaded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> Accordingly on the facts and circumstances of this case our answer to Question 3 as we understand it is in the affirmative. Anyway, we do not think it is necessary for us to deal with the issue of the actual lifting of the corporate veil as done by the majority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> But in the event that we should, we are of the view that it is now a settled law in Malaysia that the court would lift the corporate veil of a corporation if such corporation was set up for fraudulent purposes, or where it was established to avoid an existing obligation or even to prevent the abuse of a corporate legal personality. See: <i>Prest v. Prest and Others</i> [2013] UKSC 34</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> As to what constitutes fraudulent purposes it has been described as to include actual fraud or fraud in equity. See: <i>Law Kam Loy &amp; Anor v. Boltex Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors (supra)</i>. And fraud in equity occurred in '... cases where there are signs of separate personalities of companies being used to enable persons to evade their contractual obligations or duties, the court would disregard the notional separateness of the companies ...' <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_147;"><i>Sunrise Sdn Bhd v. First Profile (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 147</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 533; [1997] 1 CLJ 529; [1997] 1 AMR 1</p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> Quite recently this court also discussed on the issue of lifting a corporate veil. It said this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> The phrase 'a mere façade concealing the true facts' was recently elaborated by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in the case of <i>Prest v. Prest and Others</i> [2013] UKSC 34. The leading judgment of the court said this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> Reverting therefore to the facts and circumstances in the present case, and bearing in mind the foregoing principles, we are inclined to agree with the majority that there were justifications in the lifting of the corporate veil of the 4th appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[101]</b> It was not in dispute that the 1st appellant made the bids for the estate land in his own name. But the respondents had adduced evidence that the purchasers only agreed to the arrangement after the 1st appellant managed to convince them during the meeting before the second auction. Further, it is also a fact that part of the money for the deposit for the second auction was paid by some of the purchasers. After having successfully bid for the estate land the 1st appellant proceeded to incorporate the 4th appellant with the sole intention of transferring the estate land to it. But at the same time he was one of the directors, a shareholder and the promoter of the 4th appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[102]</b> As such, on the facts as found, we agree with the finding of the majority that the 4th appellant was the alter ego of the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant established the 4th appellant as a mere façade to transfer the ownership of the estate land in order to evade his fiduciary obligations as the solicitor towards his clients, the purchasers including the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[103]</b> Be that as it may, as we have intimated earlier on in this judgment, liabilities may be imposed against the 1st and 2nd appellants but excluding the other appellants. Thus, the lifting of the corporate veil of the 4th appellant does not necessarily mean that liability must be attached to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[104]</b> In this case the 4th appellant is no longer under the control of the 1st appellant. He had unloaded his shares in the 4th appellant as well as the shares of those who were closely associated with him after the estate land was transferred to the 4th appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[105]</b> And it is not in dispute that the estate land although registered in the name of the 4th appellant is now under the management of two corporate entities having no ties with the 1st or 2nd appellants. They are not parties to this action. There was no assertion by the respondents that these two corporate entities did not acquire those shares in good faith and for valuable consideration from the 1st appellant and the other shareholders. There was also no challenge to the fact that these two corporate entities had expended monies to develop the estate land up to the present condition. It would be 'inequitable for the purchasers to take the estate land and/or profit without incurring expenses to obtain them'. Accordingly, we make no order to declare as invalid, null and void the transfer of the estate land to the 4th appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[106]</b> In respect of the 3rd appellant, it is now in liquidation. Further, it lost the estate land not on its own volition but on force sale by auction being the consequence of its default in servicing its loan with the 5th appellant. It would serve no purpose to lift its corporate veil or to make any order against it. As for the R&amp;M, it was only exercising the powers contained in the debenture. It had done its duties and there was no allegation of misconduct on its part. Further, as we have found, the estate land is now under the control of two corporate entities that had no link to the scheme of the 1st appellant when he acquired the estate land. It would therefore be inequitable and unconscionable to now order the two corporate entities through the R&amp;M to relinquish their interests in the estate land after expending monies to develop it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 4:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>'Whether A Trust Could Be Imposed To Allow The Respondents To Acquire Equitable Interests In The Land Prior To Receivership When The Respondents Acknowledge That Their Claim Is Limited To Only A Portion Of The Total 3681 Acres Of Undivided Interest In The Land'</b>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[107]</b> In view of the findings we arrived at for Questions 1, 2 and 3, we are of the opinion that we need not answer Questions 4 and 5. As we have said above, Questions 1 and 2 may be determined on their own merits. They are not dependent on the determination of Questions 3 to 5. We therefore decline to answer Questions 4 and 5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The 5th Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[108]</b> In the case of the 5th appellant we have perused the evidence adduced and the submissions of learned counsel for the respective parties. We are inclined to agree with the finding of the learned trial judge that 'the allegation made' that the 5th appellant 'had actual knowledge of the presence' of the purchasers on the estate land 'was mere conjecture, not founded on any factual basis'. As such, the 5th appellant 'did not have any notice' of the purchasers 'alleged beneficial interest'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[109]</b> In any event the loan with the 5th appellant had been settled with the auction of the estate land. As such the 5th appellant may at worse be liable on the basis of indemnity. However that is not an issue before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusions And Orders</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[110]</b> For the reasons above we dismiss the appeals by the 1st and 2nd appellants with costs to be taxed unless agreed by the parties. Accordingly:</p>
