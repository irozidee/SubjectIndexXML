    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the High Court's decision dismissing the appellant's application to quash a committal order issued against him by the Sessions Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;119.;;">ss 119</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;417.;;">417</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;468.;;">468</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;471.;;">471 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The United States of America ('US') government made a formal request to the Malaysian government under art 11 of the Extradition Treaty Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Malaysia ('Treaty') for the extradition of the appellant. The appellant entered Malaysia with his wife on a tourist visa and was scheduled to return to Iran. He was wanted by the US government for the criminal offences of conspiracy to defraud, smuggling and illegal export. It was argued for the appellant that the dual criminality requirements under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;6.;;">ss 6(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">20(1)(c) of the Extradition Act 1992 ('the Extradition Act')</LINK> in consonance with art 2 of the Treaty was not satisfied to support the committal of the appellant under the Penal Code. That was because the offences concerned were extraterritorial offences in the US but the corresponding Malaysian law for such offences had no extraterritorial application in Malaysia. The issue was whether the appellant could be extradited for the extraterritorial offences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal</p>
    <p>Per Raus Sharif PCA (Richard Malanjum CJSS, Hasan Lah &amp; Zainun Ali FCJJ concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The dual criminality rule was not satisfied in respect of the offences committed under the corresponding Malaysian law of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2010_708;;">Strategic Trade Act 2010</LINK> as they were committed before the said Act came into force. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The dual criminality rule required extraterritoriality to extraterritoriality as per the Treaty between Malaysia and the US. Article 2(5) of the Treaty clearly provided that if the offence was committed outside the territory of the requesting state, extradition would be granted if the laws of the requested state provided for punishment of an offence committed outside its territory in similar circumstances. (paras 30-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> By an amendment to the Penal Code, the list of extraterritorial offences was extended to Chapters VI, VIA and VIB of the Penal Code (on offences against the state, offences relating to terrorism, and organised crime), if such act was done or such offence was committed in similar circumstances as stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;2.;;">s 2 of the Extradition Act</LINK>. However, the list of extraterritorial offences was not extended to Chapter V on criminal conspiracy. Therefore, the dual criminality requirement was not satisfied since the offences had no extraterritorial effect under the Penal Code. The Malaysian laws did not provide for their punishment outside its territory. They were extraterritorial offences in the US but not in Malaysia. Hence, the statement in <i>PP v. Sajad Farhadi</i> to wit "it is observed that all these offences were not extraterritorial offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;4.;;">s 4 of the Penal Code</LINK>. As such all offences are not extraterritorial in the US", was a wrong statement of law and should not be followed. (paras 32-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The "effect approach" and "continuing approach" had no application herein. Although both approaches facilitated extradition, they only rationalised the jurisdiction of the requesting state. Both approaches would not change an extraterritorial offence into a territorial offence. An individual could only be tried for offences committed abroad if it was specifically provided under statute. The courts could not extend jurisdiction to try an individual on the basis that even though the act was wholly committed abroad the effect of it was felt locally. The "conduct approach" was a more apt test applicable to determine whether the dual criminality rule was satisfied. Based on the conduct approach, the appellant could not be extradited as the US charges brought against him concerned offences committed abroad that did not have extraterritorial application in Malaysia. The appellant had not set foot on US soil. In order for the US courts to have jurisdiction to try the appellant for those alleged offences they must be allegedly committed by the appellant himself in the US and not by anyone or anywhere else outside its territorial jurisdiction. (paras 35, 43, 44, 45, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63 &amp; 64)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Based on the case authorities, the appellant could not be extradited for the offences as the corresponding offences in Malaysia had no extraterritorial application in Malaysia under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;4.;;">s 4 of the Penal Code</LINK>. In the circumstances, both the Sessions Court and the High Court misapplied the facts and the applicable law on their finding on the issue of dual criminality. On that basis, the dual criminality requirement as provided under the Extradition Act and the Treaty were not complied with in respect of the preferred offences advanced by the respondents. Both the Sessions Court and High Court had committed errors of law, which warranted appellate intervention. (paras 65-66)</p>
    <p>Per Jeffrey Tan FCJ (supporting judgment):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The litmus test was the corresponding offence in Malaysia, from the aspect of the alleged criminal conduct and the jurisdiction to punish. The jurisdiction of the requesting state was relevant where there was a corresponding offence in Malaysia. But otherwise, it would not serve any purpose to delve into the jurisdiction of the requesting state, in the absence of a corresponding offence in Malaysia. (para 83)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was not denied that the "conduct approach" or "conduct test" was both apt and practical. To find a corresponding offence was to inquire into the conduct of the criminal fugitive and not to hunt for an identical offence by a minute examination and/or comparison of the section of the law of the requesting state with that of the requested state, or by a scrutiny of the evidence. A corresponding offence was not an identical offence on all fours. (para 91)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The instant issue had nothing to do with the "effect approach" or "continuing approach". The issue was whether the appellant could be extradited, when he was not corporeally present in the US at the time of the commission of the offences. The issue was whether the appellant could be extradited for extraterritorial offences. (para 92)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Article 2(5) of the Treaty provided that where there was no corresponding extraterritorial jurisdiction, the requested state might refuse extradition. Further, under the Extradition Act, an extradition offence was subject to the proviso that in the case of an extraterritorial offence, it was so punishable under the laws of Malaysia if it took place in corresponding circumstances outside Malaysia. In the light of art 2(5) and said proviso, it was so clear that extradition offences had not been made out. (para 95)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The question on whether the dual criminality rule required the conduct to be criminal at the conduct date or at the request date might not have been settled. But given that there was no cross-appeal against the ruling that the conduct dates of alleged corresponding offences were before the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2010_708;;">Strategic Trade Act 2010</LINK> passed into law, that question ought to be answered on another occasion.

      <b>Raus Sharif PCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1] </b>This appeal concerned the legality of the detention of the appellant at the Sungai Buloh Prison pending the issuance of an order by the Minister of Home Affairs (Minister) for extradition of the appellant to the United States of America (US) under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">s 20 of the Extradition Act 1992 (Extradition Act)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant had on 11 October 2013 filed a Notice of Motion (Motion) in the High Court for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> in aid of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the committal order of the Sessions Court dated 4 September 2013. The motion was dismissed by the High Court on 9 June 2014. Hence, this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We heard the appeal on the 7 October 2014 and 11 November 2014 and unanimously allowed the same. An order for <i>habeas corpus</i> was issued and the appellant was ordered to be released .We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The background facts leading to this appeal are these. The appellant and his wife, Maryam Taefeh Rostami came to Malaysia for a holiday on 1 October 2012 via tourist visa for the purpose of visiting Penang, Langkawi and Kuala Lumpur for about two weeks. They were scheduled to return to Iran on 14 October 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 5 October 2012, the US government requested the Malaysian Government for an issuance of a provisional warrant against the appellant pursuant to art 11 of the Extradition Treaty between Malaysian Government and the US Government which was signed on 3 August 1995. The appellant was wanted by the US Government to stand trial in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, in Washington, DC for the following offences:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;13.;;">s 13(1)(b) of the Extradition Act</LINK> an order dated 5 October 2012 was made by the Magistrate for a warrant of apprehension of the appellant. It was duly executed against the appellant on 10 October 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 11 October 2012, the appellant was brought before the Magistrates' Court in Kuala Lumpur pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;16.;;">s 16(1) of the Extradition Act</LINK> and the Magistrate made an order for the appellant to be detained at Sungai Buloh Prison for sixty days from the date of arrest. On 20 November 2012 the US Government made a formal request for the extradition of the appellant to the Government of Malaysia, supported with relevant documents (Extradition Request). In the Extradition Request, it is stated that the appellant is a fugitive criminal who is required to attend a hearing in the US pursuant to an arrest warrant issued on 16 November 2011 by the Magistrate Judge, US District Court for the District of Columbia on three counts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Upon receipt of the Extradition Request, the Minister of Home Affairs issued an order to signify to the Magistrate that such request has been made. After receiving the said order, the Magistrate issued an order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;16.;;">s 16(2)(a) and (b) of the Extradition Act 1992</LINK> for the case to be transmitted to the Sessions Court and for the extension of the appellant's remand pending his appearance before the Sessions Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Sessions Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 11 December 2012, the Public Prosecutor (4th respondent) filed a Notice of Application (application) before the Sessions Court Kuala Lumpur for an order that the appellant be committed to prison pending the issuance of an order by the Minister for the extradition of the appellant to the US.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> For the purposes of the application, seven charges were preferred by the Public Prosecutor to demonstrate the existence of corresponding offences which can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The following facts (now summarised) were presented by the Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) to support the said application:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 4 September 2013, the Sessions Court committed the appellant to prison to await issuance of the Minister's order to surrender the appellant to the US. The Sessions Court held that the alleged corresponding offences, namely those under the Strategic Trades Act 2010, failed to meet the dual criminality requirement, as the alleged criminal acts occurred before the Strategic Trades Act 2010 came into force. But the Sessions Court held that the dual criminality requirement pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;6.;;">s 6 of the Extradition Act</LINK> and art 2 of the Treaty was fulfilled with respect to the alleged corresponding offences 4-7 under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK>. The Sessions Court was satisfied that based on the facts as presented, counts 1-3 were within the jurisdiction of the US courts, specifically, the United States District court for the District of Columbia. To impute dual criminality, the Sessions Court applied the cases of <i>Office of the King's Prosecutor, Brussels v. Cando Armas and Another</i> [2006] 1 All ER 647, <i>Mobarik Ali Ahmed v. The State of Bombay (S)</i> [1957] AIR SC 857 and <i>Ajay Agarwal v. Union of Union</i> [1993] AIR SC 1637. The Sessions Court was of the view that courts in the US had local jurisdiction to try the appellant on counts 1-3, and therefore there was no requirement to show the corresponding offences in Malaysia and punishable in Malaysia even if it were committed outside Malaysia.</p>

      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Against the order of committal, the appellant applied to the High Court, on 3 October 2013, for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> for his release. On 9 June 2014 the High Court dismissed the application. The High Court was satisfied that the appellant was a fugitive criminal and that the dual criminality pre-requisite under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;6.;;">s 6 of the Extradition Act</LINK> and art 2 of the Extradition Treaty was duly complied with. The High Court applied the "broad approach" or the "conduct test" as applied in <i>Re Neilson</i> [1984] AC 606 and <i>Norris v. Government USA</i> [2008] 2 All ER 1103 to conclude that there were corresponding offences under the Extradition Act. The High Court also applied the "effect approach" to hold that although the appellant was not physically present in the US during the commission of counts 1-3, it was sufficient for committal purposes, that the offences were intentionally felt in the US.</p>
    <p>The reasoning of the High Court went along the following lines:</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Before us, the appellant canvassed six grounds in support of his appeal as can be found in his petition of appeal. In evaluating the merits of this appeal, we found that this appeal essentially concerned a single issue of whether the dual criminality requirements under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;6.;;">s 6(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">s 20(1)(c) of the Extradition Act 1992</LINK> consonant with art 2 of the Extradition Treaty has been satisfied by the respondents to support the committal of the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;119.;;">s 119</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;417.;;">s 417</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;468.;;">s 468</LINK>, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;471.;;">s 471 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The contention raised by counsel for the appellant was that the appellant could only be extradited if the alleged offences committed in the US are also offences here in Malaysia. Hence, according to him, the principle of dual criminality requires that offences which are extraterritorial in the US must also be offences which are extraterritorial in Malaysia in order for the principle of dual-criminality to be satisfied to justify the appellant's extradition. This was the linchpin of the appellant's argument. Against this backdrop learned counsel for the appellant argued that the alleged extradition offences relied upon by the Sessions Court Judge to support the committal of the appellant were not extradition offences as the said offences have no extraterritorial application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;4.;;">s 4 of the Penal Code</LINK> or that under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_163;;">Extra-Territorial Offences Act 1976</LINK> if the facts were transposed here in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The DPP who appeared for the respondents replied that the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;6.;;">s 6(2) of the Extradition Act 1992</LINK>, and art 2(5) of the Extradition Treaty, with respect to extraterritorial jurisdiction, were not applicable, as the alleged offences fell within the territorial jurisdiction of the US District Court for the District of Columbia by reason of the application of the "effect approach" (learned DPP cited <i>Office of The King's Prosecutor, Brussels v. Cando Armas and Another</i> [2006] 1 All ER 647, <i>Vicenzo Melia v. USA</i> 667 F2d 3000; 1981, <i>USA v. Cotroni</i> [1989] 1 RCS 1469 and <i>Emmanuel Onwuzulike v. The Government of the United States of America</i> [2009] EWHC 1395 (admin Divisional Court), the "broad approach" (learned DPP cited <i>Re Nielson</i> [1984] AC 606 which was followed in <i>Norris v. Government USA</i> [2008] 2 All ER 1103) and the "continuing approach" (learned DPP cited <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1974_1_118;"><i>PP v.

    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Before we delve further on the merits of this appeal, it is pertinent that we refer to the relevant provisions in relation to extradition proceedings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Pertinent to note that in tandem with the extradition law of many countries, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;32.;;">s 6(2)(b) of the Extradition Act 1992</LINK> provides that "an extradition offence is an offence, however described, including fiscal offences ... which, if committed within the jurisdiction of Malaysia, is punishable under the laws of Malaysia with imprisonment for not less than one year or with death".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The definition of an extradition offence is subject to the following proviso as appears in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;1992.;;">s 6(2)(b)</LINK> which reads "Provided that, in the case of an extraterritorial offence, it is so punishable under the laws of Malaysia if it took place in corresponding circumstances outside Malaysia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Consonant with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;6.;;">s 6(2)(b) of the Extradition Act 1992</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">s 20(1)(c) of the Act</LINK> provides that the Sessions Court shall commit the criminal fugitive to prison to await the order by the Minister for his surrender if the Sessions Court is satisfied, <i>inter alia</i>, "that the alleged act or omission of the fugitive criminal would, if it had taken place in Malaysia, constitute an offence under the laws of Malaysia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">s 20(1)(c) of the Extradition Act</LINK> the Sessions Judge must first satisfy himself that the dual criminality requirement is fulfilled. This is very clear from the wordings employed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">s 20(1)</LINK> which clearly spells out that "upon being satisfied that the alleged act or omission of the fugitive criminal would, if it had taken place in Malaysia, constitute an offence under the laws of Malaysia". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">Section 20(1) of the Extradition Act 1992</LINK> is worded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Apart from the above provisions under the Extradition Act, the relevant provisions of the Extradition Treaty between the Malaysian Government and the US Government is also relevant and is hereby reproduced as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Now, reverting to the specifics of the instant case, as stated earlier the Sessions Judge had issued the committal order dated 4 September 2013 against the appellant pending the Minister's Order for his extradition to the US for the preferred offence under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK>. The Sessions Judge was of the view that the offence under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2010_708;;">Strategic Trade Act 2010</LINK> is not applicable as the alleged offences occurred prior to its enforcement. It is not in dispute that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2010_708;;">Strategic Trade Act 2010</LINK> only came into force on 1 January 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We are in agreement with the findings of the Sessions Judge on this point. It is not in dispute that the transaction which the appellant was alleged to have committed in the first to the third corresponding charges had actually occurred between 22 September 2006 to 24 September 2007; between 25 July 2007 to 24 September 2007 and between 27 July 2007 to 24 September 2007. This was way before the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2010_708;;">Strategic Trade Act 2010</LINK> (the corresponding Malaysian law) came into force. Thus, to state the obvious, the dual criminally rule has not been satisfied for offences committed under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2010_708;;">Strategic Trade Act 2010</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Now we come to the preferred charges for offences under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK>, i.e. the offence of making a false statement in a declaration that is admissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;199.;;">s 199 of the Penal Code</LINK>, offence for cheating under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;417.;;">s 417 of the Penal Code</LINK>, offence of abetting in pursuance of the conspiracy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Penal Code</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;120A.;;">s 120A of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As we have highlighted earlier the principle of dual criminality requires that offences which are extraterritorial in the US must also be offences which are extraterritorial in Malaysia in order for the principle of dual-criminality to be satisfied to justify the appellant's extradition. Perhaps it would be opportune for us first to deal with the concept of dual criminality and what it entails as a legal mechanism of some consequences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Dual criminality in the context of extradition requires that a person be extradited if there is evidence that would justify his apprehension had the act or omission constituting the offence been committed in the state to which the extradition request has been made ("the requested state"). In order to do this, the allegations of fact must be transposed. Lord Millett in <i>Regina (AI-Fawwaz) v. Governor of Brixton prison</i> [2002] 1 AC 556 explained the purpose of the requirement of double criminality in extradition in this manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We share the same reasoning of the House of Lords in <i>Al-Fawwaz</i>'s case and we accept the same as the correct proposition of the law. Bearing that in mind, we now turn to the submissions of the parties on this issue. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the alleged offences preferred against the appellant are extraterritorial in the US, but however the US courts have no jurisdiction to try the appellant as the dual criminality requirement has not been satisfied for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Learned DPP appearing on behalf of the respondents conversely submitted that the proviso in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_163;6.;;">s 6(2) of the Extradition Act</LINK> and art 2(5) of the Extradition Treaty in respect of extraterritorial jurisdiction are not applicable to this case because the charges upon which the appellant was charged falls within the territorial jurisdiction of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. To support his contention the learned DPP advocated the following approaches to be taken by this court in deciding whether the dual criminality requirement has been satisfied, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Though we appreciate the lengthy illustration by the learned DPP on the application of different approaches that can be considered by this court for the determination and satisfaction of the dual criminality principle, we however stand not persuaded by his contention. At the heart of the matter lies the issue of whether the appellant could be extradited, when he was not corporeally present in the US at the time of the commission of counts 1-3. The issue was whether the appellant could be extradited for extraterritorial offences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As rightfully pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant, the offences against the appellant, i.e. counts 1-3 were extraterritorial offences. Hence, to satisfy the dual criminality requirement the corresponding offences in Malaysia had to be extraterritorial offences in Malaysia. Put simply, the dual criminality rule required extraterritoriality to extraterritoriality. That standpoint is reflected in the Treaty between Malaysia and the US. Article 2(5) of the Treaty reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Article 2(5) clearly provides that "If the offence has been committed outside the territory of the Requesting State, extradition shall be granted if the laws of the requested state provide for punishment of an offence committed outside its territory in similar circumstances ...". Counts 1-3, which were committed outside the US, concerned the offences of conspiracy to defraud, smuggling and illegal export, which are punishable under the Penal Code and or the Customs Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The issue now is whether the corresponding offences in Malaysia has exterritorial effect. In relation to extraterritorial offences, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_163;;">Extra-Territorial Offences Act 1976</LINK> deals "with certain offences under written laws committed in any place without and beyond the limits of Malaysia and on the high seas on board any ship or on any aircraft registered in Malaysia or otherwise as if they were committed in Malaysia." <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_163;2.;;">Section 2(1) of the Extra-Territorial Offences Act 1976</LINK> read together with the Schedule makes an act contrary to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_88;;">Official Secrets Act 1972</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;;">Sedition Act 1948</LINK> as offences and "any offence under any other written law the commission of which is certified by the Attorney General to affect the security of the Federation" as an offence, "if such act is done or such offence is committed (i) on the high seas on board any ship or on any aircraft registered in Malaysia; (ii) by any citizen or any permanent resident on the high seas on board any ship or on any aircraft; and, (iii) by any citizen or any permanent resident in any place without and beyond the limits of Malaysia, be punishable as an offence under the relevant written law as if such act or offence were done or committed in Malaysia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Hence, our domestic law provides for the operation of our law beyond our territorial limits only to offences under the Official Secrets Act, the Sedition Act, and to offences under Chapters VI, VIA, and VIB of the Penal Code. Our law does not extend to other offences committed beyond our territorial limits, even if it is an offence committed in Malaysia. The law of a requesting state may provide for its jurisdiction differently. But in relation to the corresponding offence in Malaysia, we need to look at our law. If there is no corresponding offence in Malaysia, then requisition must be refused, regardless of whether the requesting state has local or extraterritorial jurisdiction. Thus, the key to unravel a requisition for the return of a criminal fugitive is the corresponding offence in Malaysia which must have extraterritorial effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Having said that, we would like to highlight here that by an amendment to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK>, the list of extra-territorial offences was extended to Chapters VI, VIA and VIB of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK> (being chapters on offences against the state, offences relating to terrorism, and organised crime), if such act is done or such offence was committed in similar circumstances as stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;2.;;">s 2 of the Extradition Act</LINK>. However, the list of extra-territorial offences was not extended to Chapter V on criminal conspiracy. Thus, with respect, we find that the dual criminality requirement has not been satisfied here as the preferred offences have no extraterritorial effect under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK>. Counts 1-3, which were committed outside the US, concerned the offences of conspiracy to defraud, smuggling and illegal export, which are punishable under the Code and or the Customs Act. But our laws do not provide for punishment of counts 1-3 committed outside our territory. They were extraterritorial offences in the US, but not in Malaysia. Hence, with respect, we must therefore rule that the statement in <i>PP v. Sajad Farhadi</i> (Criminal Application No: 44-217-12-2012), to wit "it is observed that all these offences were not extraterritorial offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;4.;;">s 4 of the Penal Code</LINK>. As such all offences are not extraterritorial in the US", was a wrong statement of law and should not be followed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Now, in our judgment, we find that the effect approach and continuing approach advanced by the learned DPP had no application. In these circumstances we would like to refer to a few cases cited by learned DPP which we feel will shed some light on the suitability of the "effect approach" and the "continuing approach".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> To begin with, the case of <i>Office of the King's Prosecutor, Brussels v. Cando Armas and Another</i> [2006] 1 All ER 647 (<i>Cando Armas</i>) specifically provides under s 65(3) of the United Kingdom's Extradition Act 2003 that the requesting state would have jurisdiction to request for the extradition of an individual even if the offences were not committed in the territory of the requesting state so long as the effect is felt there. This case concerned the provisions of a special extradition framework for simpler surrender procedures between members of the European Union that was "funded on member states' confidence in the integrity of each other's legal and judicial systems" (per Lord Bingham of Cornhill). We find with respect that this case had no application at all. If at all, it merely attested that the 'effect approach' justifies the exercise of criminal jurisdiction by a requesting state. At para 35 of the report, Lord Hope of Craighead (Lord Scott of Foscote, Baroness Hale now Lady Hale of Richmond, Lord Carswell concurring) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Moreover, it was held by the House of Lords that if the requesting state falls under a category 1 territory of the United Kingdom's Extradition Act 2003, the dual criminality requirement need not be satisfied. This can be seen from the judgment of the House of Lords at paras 34-35 which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b>
      <i>Vicenzo Melia v. USA and William F Smith, Attorney General (supra)</i> concerned the extradition of a US resident from US to Canada. Canada alleged that Melia conspired with persons in Canada to murder the girlfriend of Melia's brother. Section 423(1)(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code gave jurisdiction to Canadian courts over Melia, which jurisdiction Melia disputed. Article 3 s 3 of the [extradition] Treaty provided for extradition, if the act took place outside the requesting state and the laws of the requested state provided for jurisdiction over such offence committed in similar circumstances. That case concerned a special arrangement between the two countries. That case underscored that the 'effect approach' justifies the extension of territorial jurisdiction, where Timbers, Circuit Judge, cited the following statement of law from Justice Holmes in <i>Strassheim v. Daily</i>, 221 US 280, 285 [1911]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b>
      <i>Onwuzulike v. Government of the United States of America</i> [2009] EWHC 1395 (Admin) (<i>supra</i>) also affirmed that the 'effect approach' vindicates the jurisdiction of the requesting state. In that case, the US sought extradition of <i>Onwuzulike</i>, a United Kingdom citizen, from the UK to US to stand trial for mail fraud and wire fraud. The Crown Prosecution also wanted to prosecute <i>Onwuzulike</i> but agreed to the US prosecution to take precedence. On 9 July 2008, the Secretary of State ordered the appellant's extradition. On 22 July 2008, <i>Onwuzulike</i> lodged a statutory appeal. One of the points raised against extradition was that the alleged offences were done in London. At issue was the appropriate forum, UK or US, and the impact of the offences, which being substantially more in the US than in any one single country, was one of the factors that decided it in favour of the US. It was on the basis of the impact or effect of the fraud that the requesting state asserted its jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> As for <i>Mobarik Ali Ahmad v. The State of Bombay</i> and <i>Ajay Agarwal v. Union of Union (supra)</i>, they were not extradition proceedings. They were trials of Indian citizens who initiated and or committed the offences abroad but which the Indian courts had jurisdiction to try those offences, although committed abroad, by reason of s 188(a) of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code which provided that "when an offence is committed outside India, by a citizen of India, whether on the high seas or elsewhere, he may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at any place within India at which he may be found ... with the previous sanction of the Central Government", "such that the Indian Penal Code had territorial operation" (see para 6 of <i>Ajay Agarwal</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The case of <i>Loh Ah Hoo (supra)</i> concerned the prosecution of an offence committed within the local jurisdiction. All latter three cases were not authorities on the 'continuing approach' in extradition proceedings. But they said that where an offence is initiated abroad but completed within the local jurisdiction, the local jurisdiction could assert jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In our considered view it is not denied that the "effect approach" and the "continuing approach" albeit facilitates extradition we must not lose sight of the fact that the 'effect approach' 'impact approach' or 'continuing approach' only rationalises the jurisdiction of the requesting state, as in <i>USA v. Cotroni (supra)</i>, where it was held "it is often better that a crime be prosecuted where its harmful impact is felt and where its witnesses and the persons most interested in bringing the criminal to justice reside" (per La Forest J delivering the judgment for Dickson CJ, La Forest, L'Heureux-Dube, Gonthier and Cory JJ).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The 'effect approach', and 'continuing approach' will not change an extraterritorial offence to a territorial offence. As we have stated earlier, given that counts 1-3 of the indictment were extraterritorial offences, then the corresponding offences in Malaysia had to be extraterritorial offences. Here, the corresponding offences under the Penal Code had no extraterritorial effect as it did not fall under Chapter 4, thus the dual criminality rule has not been satisfied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Counts 1-3, which were committed outside the US, concerned the offences of conspiracy to defraud, smuggling and illegal export, which are punishable under the Penal Code and or the Customs Act. But our laws do not provide for punishment of counts 1-3 committed outside our territory. They were extraterritorial offences in the US, but not in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In this regard we agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the appellant that an individual can only be tried for offences committed abroad if it is specifically provided under statute without more the courts cannot extend its jurisdiction to try an individual on the basis that even though the act was wholly committed abroad the effect of it was felt locally.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> As an authority for this proposition learned counsel referred to the case of <i>Wong Yuh Lan v. PP</i> [2012] 4 SLR 845. In that case the United States of America (US) made a requisition to the Minister for Law ("the Minister") for the extradition of Lim Yong Nam ("Nam"), Lim Kow Seng ("Seng"), Hia Soo Gan Benson ("Hia") and Wong Yuh Lan ("Wong") (collectively termed "the applicants") to the US to stand trial. The requisition was made pursuant to the United States of America (Extradition) Order in Council, 1935 (Cap 103, OR 1) which contained the extradition treaty between the Singapore and the US ("the Singapore-US Treaty"). The US District Court issued warrants of arrest against the applicants on 15 September 2010 for 12 counts of conduct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The Singapore Attorney-General's Chambers on behalf of the State sought the committal of Wong and Nam only for count one of the Superseding Indictment for conspiracy to defraud the US by dishonest means under Title 18 United States Code s 371 ("18 USC § 371"). The US accused Wong and Nam of conspiring with one Hossein A Larijani, Paya Electronics Complex ("Paya Electronics"), Opto Electronics Pte Ltd ("Opto Electronics"), NEL Electronics Pte Ltd ("NEL"), Corezing, Seng and Hia to defraud the US by exporting modules from [Company A] ("Company A modules"), a US company, from the US to Iran via Singapore. The US complained that this breached US export restrictions against unauthorised shipment of the US-origin goods from a third country to Iran.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The District Judge issued a warrant for the apprehension of the applicants on 12 October 2011, pursuant to s 9(1)(a) read with s 10(1)(a) of the Extradition Act (Cap 103, 2000 Rev Ed) ("the Extradition Act 2000"). The applicants were apprehended on 25 October 2011 and held in remand until their committal hearing on 9 and 12 December 2011. On 10 February 2012, the District Judge committed the applicants to custody under a warrant of commitment under s 11(7) of the Extradition Act 2000. Pending extradition, the applicants sought an Order for Review of Detention before the High Court Judge under s 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) ("CPC 2010") (previously known as a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>). The State, an interested party to the proceedings, opposed the summonses for an Order for Review of Detention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In the said case, it was argued by the Counsel of Hia and Lim, that the US courts' does not have jurisdiction to try them in view that their conduct <i>vis-a-vis actus reas</i> took place entirely outside the US thus the corresponding offence in Singapore under s 109 of the Singapore Penal Code did not have extraterritorial application in the light that s 108B of the Singapore Penal Code that extended the extraterritorial application of the said section only came into force on 1st February 2008, (a year after the alleged offence was committed). In reply it was argued by counsel for the respondent, that the courts in the US have jurisdiction bearing in mind that the effect of the act was felt on US soil despite the fact that Hia and Lim were in Singapore. In deliberation Choo Han Teck J held that even though the effect of the <i>actus reas</i> was felt in the US, the courts there can only have jurisdiction if the act was committed in the US. However if it was committed abroad in absence of any overt acts the courts therefore have no jurisdiction. In view that pursuant to the principle of dual criminality the Singapore Courts cannot extend its jurisdiction to include extraterritorial offence committed abroad if it is not provided under statute (namely the Singapore Penal Code) even though the consequence of the act takes effect in Singapore. This is what the learned judge had said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Further, the learned judge had analysed the approach in England and held that it is not applicable in Singapore as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The learned judge then made the following observations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> In <i>Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong</i> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 a similar sentiment was echoed by Yong Pung How CJ of Singapore where it was held that the courts in Singapore cannot assume jurisdiction for acts committed abroad even if the effect of it is felt in Singapore when such jurisdiction it is clearly not provided under statute, to do so would be usurping the function of the Parliament, even if the effect approach doctrine is a good approach to follow. The dictum of the learned Chief Justice of Singapore can be observed as follows:</p>

      <b>[53]</b> The next case we would like to highlight is the Malaysian Supreme Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_282;"><i>PP v. Rajappan Chinna Kounder</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 282</LINK>; [1986] 1 MLJ 152; [1986] CLJ 217. The then Supreme Court had stressed that even though the <i>actus reas</i> was committed abroad and continued into our jurisdiction, our courts would not be able to try the accused unless specifically provided under statute. In that case <i>Rajappan</i> had remarried for the second time in India and brought his second wife back to Malaysia with the intention of continuing the marriage here. He was then charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;494.;;">s 494 Penal Code</LINK> for an offence of bigamy. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor argued that even though the marriage took place it India nevertheless the actus reas continued here in Malaysia and therefore the courts in Malaysia should have jurisdiction to try him for the said offence. Learned Counsel for Mr Rajappan conversely argued that the courts in Malaysia have no jurisdiction to try him for the offence of bigamy in the light that the actus reas was formed in India. It was stressed that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;494.;;">s 494 Penal Code</LINK> is not an extra territorial offence, and even if the offence continued into our jurisdiction there must be specific powers conferred upon the courts the jurisdiction to try him for the said offence in the light that the offence was formed abroad. The Supreme Court agreed with learned counsel for Mr Rajappan. Salleh Abas LP at p 286 in his judgment held that:</p>

      <b>[55]</b> The last case we would like to refer to is the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_1_306;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Lin Chien Pang Aka "Teacher Lin"</i> [1993] 1 MLRH 306</LINK>; [1993] 2 MLJ 34; [1993] 2 CLJ 225, where the US government made a request for the extradition of <i>Lin Chien Pang</i>. In order to support the extradition application it was argued by the learned DPP that despite the fact that Lin Chien Pang never set foot in America the offences in the preferred charges can sustain the application in the light that the US government has jurisdiction by virtue that the drugs were imported into the local jurisdiction of the US government. Counsel for Lin Chien Pang argued that the offences in the preferred charges are extra-territorial offences which if committed abroad would not be indictable in our jurisdiction as our <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK> has no extra-territorial application. It was also argued that the case of <i>Public Prosecutor v. Rajappan Chinna Kounder (supra)</i> has clearly set the new landscape on whether our courts have the jurisdiction to try offences committed abroad, and it was submitted on that note that even if the offences continued into our country, our courts can only have jurisdiction if such powers are clearly spelt out in the relevant legislation, <i>inter alia</i> as the jurisdiction of the courts is a creature of statute the courts cannot go beyond the jurisdiction provided by it.</p>

      <b>[56]</b> In deliberation Mokhtar Sidin J (as he then was) held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> In determining the dual criminality requirement learned DPP urged this Honourable Court to adopt the "broad conduct approach" as postulated in the case of <i>Re Neilson</i> [1984] AC 606 which was followed in the case of <i>Norris v. Government USA</i> [2008] 2 All ER 1103. In our judgment we find that the "conduct approach" is a much more apt test which can be applied to determine whether the dual criminality rule has been satisfied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In <i>Nielsen</i>, Lord Diplock (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Roskill, Lord Bridge of Harwich and Lord Brightman concurring) enunciated that the starting point, to determine whether there is an extradition offence, is to inquire whether the conduct, if it had taken place in the requested state, would have fallen foul of the laws of the requested state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The 'conduct' test was upheld in <i>Norris v. Government USA (supra)</i>, where Lord Bingham, delivering the composite opinion of the committee, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Based on the conduct approach, in our considered view the appellant in this case cannot be extradited as the preferred charges brought against him concerns offences committed abroad that does not have extra-territorial application in Malaysia. It is an undisputed fact that the appellant has never set foot in the US soil. In order for the US courts to have jurisdiction to try the appellant for those alleged offences, the alleged offences of forgery and preparing false declaration by undervaluing the airways bills (as stated in the preferred Malaysian charges) must be allegedly done by the appellant himself in US and not by anyone or anywhere else outside its territorial jurisdiction. Learned counsel referred us to the email communications made by the appellant to which it was submitted that the courts in the United States cannot assume jurisdiction (be it adopting the effect approach nor the continuing approach) to try the appellant in view that there were no alleged overt acts in the form of any alleged email communications made by the appellant which can be considered as taking place in the US in relation to the Penal Code offences as stated in the preferred charges.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> From the documentary evidence it can be inferred that the alleged false declaration and forgery by way of air way bills for the purchase of the "2010- 1 Cavity Black Spiral Antennas" and the "3120 Biconical Antennas" from a company known Microwave Engineering Corporation by Antennas and Components Lts based in Massachusetts US for Corezing International was not made in the US but rather was allegedly made in Singapore by agents of Corezing International, namely Hia and Lim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Thus, the appellant cannot be deemed as an alleged conspirator in relation to the Penal Code offences stated in the preferred charges. This is because there were no evidence provided in the supporting documents <i>vis-a-vis</i> affidavit of Agent David Parker to show that the appellant was ever involved in any alleged arrangement of conspiracy made between Corezing International Pte Ltd and Antennas &amp; Components to export the said antennas to Singapore without a license either via undervaluing the airway bills or modifying the frequencies of the said antennas.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Even though the appellant allegedly communicated via email with agents of Corezing International Pte Ltd as enclosed in exh 9, it was an isolated act and should not be deemed as part of the conspiracy as it was purely in relation to payments for companies in Iran, nothing therein to show that the appellant conspired or instructed agents of Corezing International to export the said antennas without licence or modify frequencies of the said antennas and/or undervalue the airway bills to avoid the licencing requirements. Nothing of that sort or anything illegal were ever mentioned throughout the said email communications between the appellant and agents of Corezing International or in any email communications where the appellant was privy to.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> To reiterate our views aforesaid, in order for the US Courts to have jurisdiction to try the appellant for those alleged offences, the alleged offences of forgery and preparing false declaration by undervaluing the airway bills (stated in the preferred Malaysian charges) must be allegedly done by the appellant himself in the US and not by anyone or anywhere else outside its territorial jurisdiction. However in this case the alleged false declaration and forgery by way of air way bills for the purchase of the "2010-1 Cavity Black Spiral Antennas" and the "3120 Biconical Antennas" were from a company known Microwave Engineering Corporation by Antennas and Components ltd based in Massachusetts US for Corezing International was not made in the US but rather was allegedly made in Singapore. It was made by the agents of Corezing International.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> Thus, anchored by the authorities cited above that the appellant in this case cannot be extradited for the charges preferred against him especially when the corresponding offences stated in the charges are offences with no extra territorial application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;4.;;">s 4 Penal Code</LINK>, <i>vis-a-vis</i> they are not extraditable offences. In these circumstances, we find that both the Sessions Court and the High Court had misapplied the facts and the applicable laws on their finding on the issue of dual criminality. On that basis, we are of the view that the dual criminality requirement as provided under the Extradition Act and the Extradition Treaty were not complied with in respect of the preferred offences advanced by the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Based on the reasons discussed above we were satisfied that both the Sessions Court and High Court had committed errors of law which warranted appellate intervention. We did not dwell on the other subsidiary issues raised in this appeal as in our considered view answering them will not alter our final conclusion in this appeal one way or another.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> For the above reasons we allowed the appellant's appeal and granted the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. The decisions of the learned High Court Judge and the Sessions Court were set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> My learned brother Jeffrey Tan FCJ agrees entirely with the result we have arrived at and the orders we made in this appeal. However, he had prepared a separate judgment to give his own reasons.</p>

      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>

    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> I have read the judgment of the learned President, Raus Sharif PCA, and I entirely agree with the result. But my reasoning is not exactly the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> I need not set out the background facts and the proceedings below, as they have been comprehensively set out by the learned President. I adopt the learned President's summary of the submissions before us and agree with the quoted passages from the judgment of the learned President.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> "Before us, the appellant canvassed six grounds of appeal as can be found in his petition of appeal, which, all, had to do with the dual criminality pre-requisite under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;6.;;">ss 6(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_479;20.;;">20(1)(c) of the Extradition Act</LINK> in consonant with art 2 of the Extradition Treaty has been satisfied by the respondents to support the committal of the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;119.;;">s 119</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;417.;;">s 417</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;468.;;">s 468</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;471.;;">s 471 of the Penal Code</LINK>. According to learned counsel, the principle of dual criminality requires extraterritorial offences in the US to be extraterritorial offences in Malaysia, in order to satisfy the principle of dual criminality to justify extradition, that the four alleged corresponding offences found by the Sessions Court were not extradition offences committed by the appellant and or were not committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and that the alleged corresponding offences had no extraterritorial application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;4.;;">s 4 of the Penal Code</LINK> or under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_163;;">Extra-Territorial Offences Act 1976</LINK>, that is even if the facts were transposed in Malaysia" (see judgment of the learned President).</p>

      <b>[82]</b> "Hence, our domestic law provides for the operation of our law beyond our territorial limits only to offences under the Official Secrets Act, the Sedition Act, and to offences under Chapters VI, VIA, and VIB of the Code. Our law does not extend to other offences committed beyond our territorial limits, even if it is an offence if committed in Malaysia. The law of a requesting state may provide for its jurisdiction differently. But in relation to the corresponding offence in Malaysia, we need to look at our law. If there is no corresponding offence in Malaysia, then requisition must be refused, regardless of whether the requesting state has local or extraterritorial jurisdiction. Thus, the key to unravel a requisition for the return of a criminal fugitive is the corresponding offence in Malaysia" (see judgment of the learned President).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> The litmus test is the corresponding offence in Malaysia, from the aspect of the alleged criminal conduct and the jurisdiction to punish. The jurisdiction of the requesting state is relevant where there is a corresponding offence in Malaysia. But otherwise, it will not serve any purpose to delve into the jurisdiction of the requesting state, in the absence of a corresponding offence in Malaysia. I therefore find that the authorities cited on the 'effect approach' as well as the 'continuing approach', to show the jurisdiction of the requesting state, were not helpful at all to resolve the issue of the corresponding offence/s in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> To begin with, the case of <i>Office of the King's Prosecutor, Brussels v. Cando Armas and Another</i> concerned the provisions of a special extradition framework for simpler surrender procedures between members of the European Union that was "funded on member states' confidence in the integrity of each other's legal and judicial systems" (per Lord Bingham of Cornhill). That case had no application at all. If at all, it merely attested that the 'effect approach' justifies the exercise of criminal jurisdiction by a requesting state. At para 35 of the report, Lord Hope of Craighead (Lord Scott of Foscote, Baroness Hale now Lady Hale of Richmond, Lord Carswell concurring) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b>
      <i>Vicenzo Melia v. USA and William F. Smith, Attorney General</i> concerned the extradition of a US resident from US to Canada. Canada alleged that Melia conspired with persons in Canada to murder the girlfriend of Melia's brother. Section 423(1)(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code gave jurisdiction to Canadian courts over Melia, which jurisdiction Melia disputed. Article 3 s 3 of the [extradition] Treaty provided for extradition, if the act took place outside the requesting state and the laws of the requested state provided for jurisdiction over such offence committed in similar circumstances. That case concerned a special arrangement between the two countries. That case underscored that the 'effect approach' justifies the extension of territorial jurisdiction, where Timbers, Circuit Judge, cited the following statement of law from Justice Holmes in <i>Strassheim v. Daily</i>, 221 US 280, 285 [1911]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b>
      <i>Onwuzulike v. Government of the United States of America</i> [2009] EWHC 1395 (Admin) also affirmed that the 'effect approach' vindicates the jurisdiction of the requesting state. In that case, the US sought extradition of Onwuzulike, a United Kingdom citizen, from the UK to US to stand trial for mail fraud and wire fraud. The Crown Prosecution also wanted to prosecute Onwuzulike but agreed to the US prosecution to take precedence. On 9 July 2008, the Secretary of State ordered the appellant's extradition. On 22 July 2008, Onwuzulike lodged a statutory appeal. One of the points raised against extradition was that the alleged offences were done in London. At issue was the appropriate forum, UK or US, and the impact of the offences, which being substantially more in the US than in any one single country, was one of the factors that decided it in favour of the US. It was on the basis of the impact or effect of the fraud that the requesting state asserted its jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> As for <i>Mobarik Ali Ahmed v. The State of Bombay</i> and <i>Ajay Agarwal v. Union of India</i>, they were not extradition proceedings. They were trials of Indian citizens who initiated and or committed the offences abroad but which the Indian courts had jurisdiction to try those offences, although committed abroad, by reason of s 188(a) of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code which provided that "when an offence is committed outside India, by a citizen of India, whether on the high seas or elsewhere, he may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at any place within India at which he may be found ... with the previous sanction of the Central Government", "such that the Indian Penal Code had territorial operation" (see para 6 of <i>Ajay Agarwal</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b>
      <i>Loh Ah Hoo</i> concerned the prosecution of an offence committed within the local jurisdiction. All latter three cases were not authorities on the 'continuing approach' in extradition proceedings. But they said that where an offence is initiated abroad but completed within the local jurisdiction, the local jurisdiction could assert jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b>
      <i>Re Nielsen</i> and <i>Norris v. Government USA</i>, were more to the point. "In <i>Nielsen</i>, Lord Diplock (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Roskill, Lord Bridge of Harwich and Lord Brightman concurring) enunciated that the starting point, to determine whether there is an extradition offence, is to inquire whether the conduct, if it had taken place in the requested state, would have fallen foul of the laws of the requested state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> "The 'conduct test' was upheld in <i>Norris v. Government USA</i>, where Lord Bingham, delivering the composite opinion of the committee, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> It is not denied that the 'conduct approach' or 'conduct test' is both apt and practical. To find a corresponding offence is to inquire into the conduct of the criminal fugitive and not to hunt for an identical offence by a minute examination and or comparison of the section of the law of the requesting state with that of the requested state, or by a scrutiny of the evidence. A corresponding offence is not an identical offence on all fours (see <i>Mauro v.</i><i>Government of the United States of America</i> [2009] EWHC 150 (Admin) para 4). "An extradition judge is not vested with the function of considering the jurisdiction of the requesting state to prosecute the offence. The judge's role under s 18(1)(b) of the Extradition Act is the modest one of determining whether the evidence would justify the fugitive's committal for trial under Canadian law if the crime had been committed in Canada. Nothing in the Act requires the judge to consider where the acts charged took place, or the jurisdiction of the requesting state. The jurisdiction of the requesting state and its organs to prosecute a crime are matters governed by the law of that state. The determination of an extradition crime is conduct based so that the question to be asked is whether the impugned acts or conduct, if committed in Canada, would constitute a crime here. The acts charged in this case would be a crime if committed in Canada. The so-called "double criminality rule" (no one in Canada should be extradited for behaviour that is not a crime in Canada) has been met. The 'mirror image' concept should not be adopted" (<i>United States of America v. Lepine</i> [1994] 1 SCR 286, per the judgment of La Forest, L'Heureux- Dube, Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> It is accepted that by application of the 'effect approach' or 'impact approach', jurisdiction may be rightly assumed. It is granted that on the basis of the alleged criminal conduct, alleged corresponding offences 4-7 were similar to counts 1-3. But the instant issue had nothing to do with the 'effect approach' or 'continuing approach'. The issue was whether the appellant could be extradited, when he was not corporeally present in the US at the time of the commission of counts 1-3. The issue was whether the appellant could be extradited for extraterritorial offences. "At the heart of most extraterritoriality cases lies the effects test" (<i>The Effects Test: Extraterritoriality's Fifth Business</i>, by Austen L Parrish). "The effect principle is ... to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction" (Ireland-Piper, Danielle - "<i>Extraterritorial Criminal Jurisdiction: Does the Long Arm of the Law Undermine the Rule of Law</i>" [2012] MelbJlIntLaw 5; (2012) 13(1) Melbourne Journal of International Law 122). "The 'effect approach' 'impact approach' or 'continuing approach' only rationalises the jurisdiction of the requesting state, as in <i>USA v. Cotroni</i>, where it was held 'it is often better that a crime be prosecuted where its harmful impact is felt and where its witnesses and the persons most interested in bringing the criminal to justice reside' (per La Forest J delivering the judgment for Dickson CJ, La Forest, L'Heureux-Dube, Gonthier and Cory JJ) and a host of other cases. But the 'effect approach' 'impact approach' or 'continuing approach' will not change an extraterritorial offence to a territorial offence" (see judgment of the learned President).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> Counts 1-3 were yet extraterritorial offences. That important point was missed by both sides. Given that counts 1-3 were extraterritorial offences, then correspondingly, the corresponding offences in Malaysia had to be extraterritorial offences in Malaysia. "The dual criminality rule required extraterritoriality to extraterritoriality. That standpoint is reflected in the Treaty between Malaysia and the US. Article 2(5) reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> "Article 2(5) clearly provides that 'If the offence has been committed outside the territory of the Requesting State, extradition shall be granted if the laws of the requested state provide for punishment of an offence committed outside its territory in similar circumstances ...'. Counts 1-3, which were committed outside the US, concerned the offences of conspiracy to defraud, smuggling and illegal export, which are punishable under the Code and or the Customs Act. But our laws do not provide for punishment of counts 1-3 committed outside our territory. They were extraterritorial offences in the US, but not in Malaysia. It was not 'as night follows day'. Hence, with respect, [I] must therefore rule that the statement in <i>PP v. Sajad Farhadi</i> (Criminal Application No: 44-217-12-2012, to wit 'it is observed that all these offences were not extraterritorial offence under s 4 of the Penal Code. As such all offences are not extraterritorial in the US', was a wrong statement of law which should not be followed" (see judgment of the learned President).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> Article 2(5) provides that where there is no corresponding extraterritorial jurisdiction, the requested state may refuse extradition. Further, under the Extradition Act 1992, an extradition offence is subject to the proviso that "in the case of an extraterritorial offence, it is so punishable under the laws of Malaysia if it took place in corresponding circumstances outside Malaysia". In the light of art 2(5) and said proviso, it was so clear that extradition offences had not been made out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> For completeness, I wish to add that whether the double criminality rule requires the conduct to be criminal at the conduct date or at the request date might not have been settled (see <i>R v. Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet (No 3)</i> [2000] AC 147, at pp 194-196; see also <i>International Extradition, United States Law and Practice</i>, 6th edn by M Cherif Bassiouni at p 502). But given that there was no cross-appeal against the ruling that the conduct dates of alleged corresponding offences 1-3 were before the Strategic Trade Act 2010 passed into law, I ought to leave that question to be answered on another occasion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> It was for those reasons that I agreed with the result.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
