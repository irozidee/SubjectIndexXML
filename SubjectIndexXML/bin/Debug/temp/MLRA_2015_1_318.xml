    <p>In the instant appeal, the appellant's main ground of appeal centred on the existence and truthfulness of three disputed documents, namely: exh D3 (deed of assignment dated 13 March 1996); exh D4 (sale and purchase agreement dated 18 January 2000); and exh P20 (deed of assignment dated 18 January 2000). The appellant complained that the Judicial Commissioner ("JC") misdirected herself in finding that the appellant ought to have proven fraud beyond reasonable doubt when the respondent had failed to discharge the burden of proving to the court the genuineness of all the three documents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">ss 101</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;103.;;">103 of the Evidence Act 1950 ("Act")</LINK>, whoever desires any court to give judgment in respect of any legal right must prove that those facts he asserts in support of such right exist. ln view of the challenges by the appellant on the existence and genuineness of the three exhibits in the present case, it was incumbent on the respondent to prove exhs D3, D4 and P20 were true and genuine. The respondent had to do so before he could assert any right arising from the alleged transactions vide those documents. In the instant case, the JC had shifted the burden of proof on the appellant before ensuring that the respondent had discharged his burden to prove that the exhibits in question existed and were genuine. If the JC had properly appraised herself of the issues and evidence raised in relation to the documents, she would have come to a different conclusion. (paras 11, 13 &amp; 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> If the JC had taken into account the unexplained discrepancies and irregularities, she would not have concluded that the exhibits were genuine and the true representations of the transaction between parties. The exhibits which formed the basis of the respondent's claim were too tainted with unexplained discrepancies and irregularities which could lead to an inference that their genuineness may be in doubt. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The failure to call the solicitor who had prepared exh D3 attracted the invocation of the presumption under s 114(g) of the Act against the respondent. The solicitor, if he had been produced, would have been able to explain the mystery of exh D3. The respondent had failed to establish on the balance of probabilities that the three exhibits were all genuine and that they represented the true transaction between the parties. The respondent had thus not proven his case. The JC had erred in upholding the documents as genuine and by shifting the burden of proving fraud onto the appellant. (paras 28, 32, 34 &amp; 35)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Rohana Yusuf JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by Marappan a/l Muthusamy (the appellant) against the decision of the High Court of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur dated 25 September 2012. On 24 June 2013 we heard the appeal which we allowed. We now set out the reasons for our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant together with five others purchased a 2-storey shop house (the property) held under HS (D) 49503 Lot PT 429 (Master Title) Mukim Setapak, Daerah Kuala Lumpur at a purchase consideration of RM188,000.00. Each of them has a ⅙ share in the property, which was registered under the appellant's name as a trustee pursuant to a trust deed dated 7 June 1993. The appellant was holding ⅚ shares in trust for the benefit of the other five co-owners. Under the trust deed the appellant was entitled to collect rental proceeds and for that he must maintain a proper ledger and account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> A sale and purchase agreement (SPA1) was made on 13 March 1996 where Nallayan (one of the co-owners) acquired the shares of 4 of the co-owners making his total share in the property to be ⅚. The parties did not dispute this SPA. He had purportedly acquired each share at a price of RM30,000.00 amounting to RM120,000.00 from all the four co-owners. At the same time there is also a deed of assignment (DOA1) purportedly entered by Nallayan and the four co-owners. The DOA was produced and marked as exh D3. This is one of the documents in contention at the trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Another sale and purchase agreement (SPA2) marked as exh D4 was purportedly entered between Nallayan and one R Sivam a/l Ramasamy (the respondent) dated 18 January 2000 where Nallayan purportedly sold all his ⅚ shares at a purchase price of RM400,000.00. A deed of assignment (DOA2) dated 18 January 2000 marked as exh P20 was also purportedly executed. The genuineness of these two documents, namely, exhs D4 and P20 was seriously contested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Meanwhile, Nallayan had filed a civil suit vide D5-22-1669-2000 against the appellant for failing to furnish any account to co-owners since he became a trustee on 8 September 2000. Pending the suit Nallayan was adjudicated a bankrupt by two Receiving and Adjudication Orders dated 13 August 2002 and 15 January 2003 respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The civil suit was fixed for hearing but parties agreed to an out of court settlement. On 25 July 2006 Nallayan withdrew the suit against the appellant. A settlement agreement was made where the appellant agreed to sell his ⅙ share in the property to the respondent. The appellant was alleged to have failed to honour the settlement agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondent who had acquired ⅚ shares vide exhs D4 and P20 filed a claim against the appellant in the current action seeking for a number of reliefs, which were allowed by the learned JC. The appellant's counter claim however was dismissed by the learned JC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It was agreed by the parties at the trial in the High Court that there were three issues to be determined. They further agreed that if the answers to the three issues were in the affirmative, the respondent would be entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the statement of claim and conversely if the three issues were in the negative, the appellant would be entitled to the reliefs sought in the counter claim. The three issues were these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In her judgment the learned JC held that the appellant failed to prove fraud and or forgery in exhs D3, D4 and P20 and hence, she accepted these documents to be genuine, representing the true transactions between parties. By reason thereof, the learned JC allowed the following reliefs to the respondent:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Against this decision the appeal was brought before us by the appellant. The appellant's main ground of appeal centred on the existence and truthfulness of the three disputed documents namely, exhs D3, D4 and P20. The main complaint raised by the appellant is that the learned trial JC misdirected herself in her finding that the appellant/defendant ought to have proven fraud beyond reasonable doubt when the respondent/plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proving to the court the genuineness of all the three exhibits in establishing his claim. We find merits in the grounds raised by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is trite law as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">ss 101</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;103.;;">103 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> that whoever desires any court to give judgment in respect of any legal right must prove that those facts he asserts in support of such right exist. In view of the challenges by the appellant on the existence and genuineness of the three exhibits in the present case, it is incumbent on the plaintiff/respondent to prove exhs D3, D4 and P20 are true and genuine. He must do so before he can assert any right arising from the alleged transactions vide these documents (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_448;"><i>Juahir Sadikon v. Perbadanan Kemajuan Ekonomi Negeri Johor</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 448</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 627; [1996] 4 CLJ 1; [1996] 3 AMR 2984, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_739;"><i>Dolomite Readymixed Concrete Sdn Bhd v. Zalam Corporation Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2012] MLRHU 739</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_385;"><i>Johara Bi Abdul Kadir Marican v. Lawrence Lam Kwok Fou &amp; Anor</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 385</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 139, His Lordship Chang Ming Tat FJ approved the judicial approach taken by the High Court in that case, <i>viz</i> until and unless a plaintiff has discharged the onus on it to prove its case on a balance of probabilities, the burden does not shift to the defendant and no matter if the defendant's case is completely unbelievable, the claim against him must be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In the present case the defendant/appellant challenged the existence of all these three exhibits. It is therefore incumbent on the respondent/plaintiff to first establish that these three documents are genuine and represented the true transactions as alleged. In our view the learned JC misdirected herself when she states in her ground of judgment "Dari alasan-alasan di atas saya telah putuskan yang D3, D4 dan P20 adalah dokumen yang gagal dibuktikan oleh defendan yang ianya dibuat secara frod. Maka D3, D4 dan P20 adalah dokumen-dokumen yang sah dan berkuatkuasa dan transaksi dengan mennggunakan D3, D4 dan P20 di dalam tindakan ini adalah transaksi yang benar dan sah disisi undang-undang dan kesahihan dokumen-dokumen tersebut tidak boleh dipertikaikan." The learned JC had shifted the burden of proof on the defendant/appellant before ensuring that the plaintiff/respondent discharged his burden to prove that the exhibits in question exist and are genuine.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We agree with learned counsel for the appellant that if the learned JC had properly appraised herself with the issues and evidence raised in relation to these documents she would have come to a different conclusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We first turn to exh D3, the first document in issue in this case. Exhibit D3 is purportedly a deed of assignment (DOA) dated the same date as the sale and purchase agreement (SPA), ie 13 March 1996. The SPA is an agreed document where the four beneficiaries agreed to sell their respective shares to Nallayan. Exhibit D3 on the other hand, is a disputed document with the purpose as stated in the document "to add up the rights of the purchaser", namely, Nallayan. The DOA seeks to assign to Nallayan the right to collect the proceeds of the ⅚ shares of the property for a period from 7 June 1993 to 13 March 1996. It is to be noted that the subject matter of the assignment predated its execution date of 13 March 1996 as well as the date of the SPA, which confers the right over the ⅚ shares in the property to Nallayan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant challenged the genuineness of exh D3 and submitted that the learned JC in finding that exh D3 is a genuine document failed to consider the following facts and evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The respondent's case was that the DOA was drawn up by the same Solicitor Ti Chin Lee and was executed on the same date of 13 March 1996 but the DOA never came to surface until the year 2010. The format of these two documents differs greatly in their appearances in that the SPA was typed written and the DOA is a computer print. The signing page of the SPA and the DOA came from the same typed written version (see Core Bundle tag 7 compared to Core Bundle tag 10). A comparison of these two documents would show clearly that the signing page of the DDA was annexed with a copy of the signing page from the SPA. The SPA makes no reference at all to the DOA and the stamping of the DOA was made 14½ years later.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Nallayan in his application to enter a caveat over the property on 5 February 1998 made no mention of the existence of the DOA. Both co-owners, Arumugam (SD1) and Gnanasegaran (PW2) testified at the trial that they never executed exh D3.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Exhibits D4 and P20 (see Tab 11 and Tab 12 of the Core Bundle) are also fraught with the same kind of discrepancies and irregularities as exh D3. The following evidence was disclosed. Exhibit D4 is a sale and purchase agreement dated 18 January 2000. It purports to sell Nallayan's ⅚ shares to the respondent at a consideration of RM400,000.00. Exhibit P20 is a deed of assignment of even date, that is, 18 January 2000 with exh D4. Under exh P20 Nallayan had purported to assign to the respondent the right to collect all proceeds for the ⅚ share in the property which was outstanding since 7 June 1993.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> lt must be borne in mind that when Nallayan filed a suit against the appellant in the year 2000, about nine months after the purported sale of his ⅚ share of the property to the respondent, who is his nephew, exhs D4 and P20 were never produced in court in that suit. More importantly if these documents indeed existed at the time Nallayan filed his 2000 suit, he no longer would have any beneficial interest in the property to maintain a <i>locus standi</i> to file the claim against the appellant. Yet in his testimonies Nallayan when asked why these documents were not produced before the court blamed his solicitors who allegedly advised him that these documents were not important to the suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is pertinent to note that, despite the allegation that both exhs D4 and P20 were purportedly executed on the same day, that is, 18 January 2000, exh D4 was produced to be witnessed at the Temerloh Sessions Court while exh P20 was produced to be witnessed by a Commissioner of Oath N Senggodan. Exhibit P20 only came to light in the year 2010 and it was also never disclosed at Nallayan's 2000 suit. Exhibit D4 was never factored into the settlement agreement dated 25 July 2006. Nallayan admitted during the trial that exh P20 was never given to the appellant nor did he inform the appellant of its existence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It was when the appellant applied to remove the caveat on the property that the respondent obtained a court Order vide High Court Originating Summons No: S5-24-2643-2007 to preserve the caveat using exh D4 which came to light only in 2007, about eight years after the alleged purchase of the ⅚ share on 18 January 2000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is also peculiar that the respondent as the owner of ⅚ share in the property never insisted for Nallayan to remove the caveat lodged since 5 February 1998 (see exh D2 tab 14 of the Core Bundle).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> If it is true that Nallayan had disposed all his shares to the respondent on 18 January 2000 vide exh D4 then he would not have any capacity to file a civil suit at the Kuala Lumpur High Court Suit vide No: D5-22-1669-2000 on 8 September 2000. Further to that Nallayan and the respondent admitted that exh D4 was never disclosed to the Inland Revenue Board and no Real Property Gains Tax was paid in respect of the alleged transaction involving RM400,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We agree with the submission of learned counsel for the appellant that had the learned JC took into account these unexplained discrepancies and irregularities she would not have concluded that these exhibits are genuine and are the true representations of the transaction between parties. In our view and in line with the decision of the Federal Court in <i>Johara Bi Abdul Kadir Marican v. Lawrence Lam Kwok Fou &amp; Anor</i>, the burden to establish fraud by the appellant had not arisen in the circumstances of this case because the respondent/ plaintiff had not discharged his burden to establish his case premised on the exhs D3, D4 and P20. These exhibits, which form the basis of the respondent's claim, are too tainted with unexplained discrepancies and irregularities that could lead to an inference that their genuineness may be in doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is the respondent's case that exh D3 was prepared by the same solicitor Ti Chin Lee at his Bentong Office, who was also the solicitor who prepared the SPA dated 13 March 1996 signed by all the signatories on the same day before the said solicitor. Its genuineness would be in question if and when exh D3, which is said to be contemporaneous to the SPA dated 31 September 1996, are made from different prints and when its signing page appear to have been inserted with the signing page of the SPA. Gnanasegaran (PW2) testified he only sign one document while Arumugam DW1 testified he never executed the DOA but only signed the SPA. DW1 also said he only saw exh D3 for the first time in October 2010. He denied assigning any right to the Nallayan and claimed that his signature had been inserted in the signing page of exh D3.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> A letter of demand dated 5 December 1996 by the solicitor for the respondent made no mention of the DOA (exh D3). At the trial of the suit filed by Nallayan, which dragged for six years, there was no disclosure that exh D3 existed at the point when the settlement agreement dated 25 July 2006, was executed. Further to that exh D3 was never pleaded in the statement of claim by the respondent. The learned JC appeared to have overlooked these facts in finding that exh D3 was a valid document in the light of the evidence referred to above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that if the DOA (exh D3) was prepared by the same solicitor who also prepared the SPAI of even dates, these discrepancies, which brought about suspicion, would not have arisen. The failure of the respondent to call the solicitor to testify on these documents despite informing the appellant in writing that he would be present to testify, in our view attract the invocation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> against the respondent. There was no explanation being offered by the respondent as to his failure to call this material witness despite notifying the appellant in writing that he would procure the attendance of Ti Chin Lee as witness at the trial. lt would be imperative upon the respondent to call the material witnesses he had undertaken to do in writing, and the failure to do so without explanation could lead to an adverse inference against the respondent. ln the circumstances we agree with learned counsel for the appellant that the legal inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK> applies against the respondent. The solicitor, Ti Chin Lee, if he had been produced before the court at the trial would surely be able to explain the mystery of exh D3.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The next disputed document is exh D4, which is the sale and purchase agreement for Nallayan's ⅚ shares to the respondent. Exhibit D4 is dated 18 January 2000 wherein a purchase consideration of RM400,000.00 was made. Nallayan initiated a civil action against the appellant vide Kuala Lumpur High Court No: D5-22-1669-2000 filed on 8 September 2000. ln that suit Nallayan sought for audited accounts of rental and proceeds from the property. lt is to be observed that by exh D4 Nallayan had sold off his ⅚ shares in the property to the respondent. That being the case, what could have been the capacity of Nallayan in filing the suit against the appellant? Furthermore in his pleaded case in that suit, he did not plead exh D4 and how could he even say the exh D4 was not important?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> While the suit was pending Nallayan was adjudicated a bankrupt on 13 August 2002. On 25 July 2006 Nallayan withdrew the action and entered into a settlement agreement dated 25 July 2006 where the appellant agreed to sell his ⅙ share to the respondent. We also find it peculiar that Nallayan could have withdrawn the suit and entered into a settlement agreement considering his lack of capacity as an undischarged bankrupt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On 1 December 2006 the respondent entered a caveat which he admitted during the trial was done on the instruction of Nallayan a/l Ramasamy. When the appellant tried to remove the caveat the respondent then produced exh D4 for the first time. This came to light in 2007, almost eight years after the alleged purchase took place on 18 January 2000. The Commissioner for Oath can explain the facts surrounding exhs D4 and P20 (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_3_164;"><i>Caley Ototo Worldwide Sdn Bhd v. Sun Wen Long</i> [2009] 3 MLRH 164</LINK>; [2009] 9 MLJ 1; [2010] 1 CLJ 725) but as in the case of the solicitor he was not called to give evidence. The court is entitled to have the best evidence before it and the appellant was justified in imploring this court to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In view of the various issues raised in relation to exhs D3, D4 and P20 we are inclined to agree with the submission of learned counsel for the appellant that the learned JC had in coming to her findings overlooked or did not give due consideration to the facts and evidence referred to above. We find that the learned JC failed make any adverse inference against the respondent under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK> for failure to call three material witnesses namely ,the solicitor Ti Chen Lee, the officer of the Land Office to verify P7, which is a copy of exh D4 and the Commissioner of Oath, S Senggodan, to throw light into the mysterious existence of the three disputed exhibits despite stating in writing that these witnesses will be called to testify.</p>

      <b>[33]</b> The Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_605;"><i>Jaafar Shaari &amp; Siti Jama Hashim v. Tan Lip Eng &amp; Anor</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 605</LINK>; [1997] 3 MLJ 693; [1997] 4 CLJ 509 clarified the legal position in relation to document as evidence in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Applying the principle laid down in <i>Jaafar Shaari</i> and having perused through the Appeal Records we find that the respondent had failed to establish on the balance of probabilities that the three exhibits in question are all genuine and they truly represented the true transaction between parties. In other words, the respondent had not proven his case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We find the learned JC had fallen into error in upholding these documents as genuine and shifted the burden of proving fraud on the appellant/defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We therefore allowed the appeal of the appellant and set aside the Orders of the High Court and consequently we allowed the counter claim of the appellant. We allowed costs at RM75,000.00 here and below to the respondent with the deposit be refunded to the appellant.</p>
