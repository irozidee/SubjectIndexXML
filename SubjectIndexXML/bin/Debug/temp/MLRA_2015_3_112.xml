    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his conviction and sentence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A of the Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971 ("FIPA")</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>, for discharging a firearm during the commission of a robbery with one Jayakumar, who had since died. The appellant submitted that the charge against him ("the instant charge") was bad for duplicity, as it included elements of both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">ss 3</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">3A of the FIPA</LINK> and that the defective charge could not be cured by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC")</LINK>. In opposing this appeal, the prosecutor relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">s 156 of the CPC</LINK> and argued that as the appellant was able to put up his defence, he was therefore not misled, and that no prejudice had been occasioned. Hence, the issues to be decided were, whether each of the offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">ss 3</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">3A of the FIPA</LINK> could be the subject of a separate charge against the appellant and could be heard together in one trial; and whether the duplicity in the instant charge could be cured by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">ss 156</LINK> and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">422 of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The instant charge could not be the subject of separate charges that could be heard together in one trial, as a charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3 of the FIPA</LINK> would not permit a further charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A of the FIPA</LINK>, and <i>vice versa</i>. Under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;;">FIPA</LINK>, an offender could not be both a principal offender and an accomplice at the same time. So even if separate charges could be preferred, the appellant could not be charged and tried under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">ss 3</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">3A of the FIPA</LINK>. (<i>Yap Leow Swee v. PP (distd)</i>; <i>See Yew Poo v. PP (distd)</i>; <i>PP v. Mohamed Fathi bin Haji Ahmad (distd)</i>). (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">Sections 156</LINK> and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">422 of the CPC</LINK> could not save a defective charge where the accused was misled and a failure of justice had occasioned. In the instant case, the omission in not stating the presence of the appellant at the scene would have misled him to believe that the case to answer was not for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A of the FIPA</LINK>. Following that, the omission in not stating the presence of the appellant at the scene coupled with the error in stating that the appellant and Jayakumar discharged a firearm could have convinced the appellant that the case to answer was indeed for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3 of the FIPA</LINK>. Hence, it was apparent that the appellant had been misled and accordingly a failure of justice had been occasioned. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The charge for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3 of the FIPA</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A of the FIPA</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> was unknown in law. Therefore, the conviction of the appellant was a nullity. Clearly, there was a total failure in the administration of justice which could only be put right by an order in favour of liberty of the subject, and thus the appellant's conviction and sentence should be set aside.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was tried and convicted by the High Court for the following two offences.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Against conviction and sentence for the offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A of the Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971 (FIPA)</LINK>, the appellant appealed, but in vain, to the Court of Appeal (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_679;"><i>Ravindran Ramasamy v. PP</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 679</LINK>; [2013] 4 MLJ 665; [2013] 8 CLJ 834; [2013] 4 AMR 502). The appellant appealed to this court. On 22 September 2014, we unanimously allowed the appeal and set aside the said conviction and sentence. We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At 11.00am on 14 January 2008, the appellant and one Jayakumar a/l Muniady (Jayakumar) entered the premises of "Kedai Emas Gayathri Tangga Mahligai Jewellers" of 42 Lebuh Pasar, District of Timur Laut, with the intention to commit robbery. Once inside the jeweller's premises, the appellant proceeded, with a hammer, to smash the glass display cases/cabinets. At about the same time, Jayakumar discharged a shot from the gun in his hand. Both appellant and Jayakumar, who wore gloves, then grabbed the jewellery from the broken display cases/cabinets. But they encountered resistance from the jeweller (PW3) who threw chairs and other utensils at them. Jayakumar shot at PW3 but missed. Jayakumar and the appellant then bolted from the scene. But the appellant was apprehended not far from the jeweller's premises. Jewellery that belonged to PW3 was found on the appellant. As for Jayakumar, he made good his escape, only to be later killed in a separate shoot-out with the police on 17 March 2009. Those were the primary facts that the prosecution adduced at the trial against the appellant, and upon which the appellant was convicted for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A of FIPA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In his written submission, learned counsel for the appellant categorically accepted those primary facts as established facts. But learned counsel orally submitted that the charge was bad for duplicity, and that the defective charge could not be cured by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the Criminal Procedure Code (the CPC)</LINK>. The learned Deputy Prosecutor cited <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">s 156 of the CPC</LINK> and replied that the appellant who was able to put up his defence was therefore not misled, and that no prejudice had been occasioned.</p>

"As regards duplicity, the leading English authority on the subject is the case of Charles Wilmot 24 Cr AR, p 63 where the Lord Chief Justice quotes with approval the following passage from the judgment of Avory J in <i>Rex v. Surrey Justices; Ex parte Witherick</i> [1932] 1 KB 450 at p 452: "It is an elementary principle that an information must not charge offences in the alternative, since the defendant cannot then know with precision with what he is charged, and of what he is convicted, and may be prevented on a future occasion from pleading <i>'autrefois convict'</i>."

"A charge is only bad for duplicity when it alleges facts constituting two different activities; it is legitimate to charge in a single charge one activity even though that activity might involve more than one act." (<i>Jemmison v. Priddle</i> [1972] 1 All ER 539 per Lord Widgery CJ).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Latent duplicity is committed when a single charge describes more than one offence. "Latent duplicity (also called 'latent ambiguity' or 'latent uncertainty') [is] where a single charge alleges the commission of only one offence, but the evidence led by the prosecution in relation to the charge discloses a number of separate offences, all of which could fit the allegation described in the charge" Ravindran Ramasamy (Updates on legal developments by the Victorian Government Solicitor's Office dated 28 April 2014: 'Double or nothing' - The rule against duplicity in charging criminal offences). But to establish duplicity in a charge, it is not enough to show that the section or paragraph under which the accused is charged contemplated two offences; it is necessary to go further and show that both offences have been included in the same charge, thus embarrassing the accused in his defence and making it impossible for him to plead autrefois convict in respect of either of the alternatives (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1946_1_26;"><i>Saw Tuan Cheong v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1946] 1 MLRA 26</LINK>; [1946] 1 MLJ 143). Ambiguity and latent duplicity in the charge must be such as to have caused a miscarriage of justice (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1948_1_241;"><i>Tai Chai Keh v.

    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> That said, the charge against the appellant was for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>. Going by that section of the law, the appellant was an accomplice and it should follow that the particulars of the offence would agree with the alleged fact that the appellant was an accomplice. But that was not how the instant charge was framed. The instant charge alleged that the appellant and Jayakumar discharged a firearm ("Bahawa kamu bersama-sama seorang lagi yang telah meninggal dunia, pada 14 Januari 2008, jam lebih kurang 11.00 pagi, di Kedai Emas Gayathri Tangga Mahligai Jewellers, No 42 Lebuh Pasar, dalam Daerah Timur Laut, dalam Negeri Pulau Pinang, telah melepaskan tembakan yang boleh menyebabkan kematian semasa melakukan rompakan"), which was at odds with a charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>. At the same time, the instant charge also alleged that the appellant was aware that Jayakumar had in his custody or control a firearm ("di mana kamu mengetahui rakan sejenayah tersebut ada di bawah jagaan atau kawalannya senjata api"), which was consistent with a charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>.<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;153.;;"> Section 153 of the CPC</LINK> required that "the charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence .... as are reasonably sufficient to give the [appellant] notice of the matter with which he is charged". But given that the particulars of the alleged offence straddled both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>, it would not seem that the instant charge could have given fair notice to the appellant of the section of the law against which the alleged offence was said to have been committed. "The real test in all these cases is whether the accused person gets sufficient certain notice of what is charged against him" (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1960_1_60;"><i>Teng Kum Seng v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1960] 1 MLRH 60</LINK>; [1960] MLJ 225 per Thomson CJ). The instant charge might have stated that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK> was offended. But as the particulars of the instant charge also pointed to another <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK> of the law being offended, it must be seriously doubted that the mere mention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK> would have conveyed to the appellant that there was no other section of law against which the alleged offence was said to have been committed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> To the contrary, the particulars in the instant charge could even have conveyed that the section of law against which the alleged offence was said to have been committed was <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK>. One essential ingredient of a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK> offence is the presence of the accomplice at the scene of the commission or attempted commission or abetment of the scheduled offence. But the presence of the appellant at the scene was not stated in the instant charge, which should not be so if the section of law against which the alleged offence was said to have been committed were <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>. On the other hand, the fact of the appellant being at the scene needed not be stated if the section of law against which the alleged offence was said to have been committed were <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK>. Suffice it to say that the instant charge was at sixes and sevens. While it stated that the section of the law against which the alleged offence was said to have been committed was <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>, it also pointed to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The mess in the instant charge was compounded by the fact that it stated that the section of law against which the alleged offence was said to have been committed was to be read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>, which <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> provides that "when a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">Section 34</LINK>, which was and is an evidential provision, was not an ingredient of the alleged offence. But with the induction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK>, the instant charge gave notice to the appellant that the case against him was that the criminal act done by him and Jayakumar was as if was done by him alone. In effect, the notice to the appellant was that the discharge of the firearm was as if it were discharged by him. The instant charge also alleged that the appellant was aware that Jayakumar had in his custody or control a firearm. Plainly, the instant charge described two offences or parts of two offences, one under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK> and the other under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>, which ran foul of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;163.;;">s 163 of the CPC</LINK>, and was therefore bad for duplicity.</p>

      <b>[14]</b> "One trend in judicial opinion that is discernible in the cases cited is that the courts are more ready to impugn a charge as bad for duplicity where it contains more than one offence in the alternative" (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1981_1_649;"><i>Haji Abdul Ghani bin Ishak &amp; Anor v.

    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> But even if so, the instant charge could not have been the subject of separate charges that could have been proceeded with in one trial, as a charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK> would not permit a further charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>, and <i>vice versa</i>.

PP</i> [2002] 6 MLRH 745</LINK>; [2002] MLJ 197, where the charge did not follow the wording of the law that created the offence, and where Low Hop Bing J, as he then was, said that the charge was so defective as to render it an illegality such that it was impossible to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">ss 156</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">422 of the CPC</LINK>, (iii) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_8_236;"><i>Hazraf Ali Hassan v. PP</i> [2011] 8 MLRH 236</LINK>; [2012] 7 MLJ 355, where Akhtar Tahir J held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">s 156</LINK> does not apply where the defect in the charge does not disclose any known offence, and that the accused was "prejudiced by prejudiced by being ignorant of the actual nature of the offence committed by him. As such he would be unable to properly defend himself ", and (iv) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1821;"><i>PP v.

Evidently, recent authority would not agree with <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1937_1_330;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Lee Pak</i> [1937] 1 MLRH 330</LINK>; [1937] MLJ 265, where the essential ingredients of the offence were missing, but it was held by Whitley Ag CJ that the errors were covered by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">s 156</LINK> as it was not alleged that the accused was misled.</p>

      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;156.;;">Sections 156</LINK> and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">422 of the CPC</LINK> would not save a defective charge where the accused was misled and a failure of justice had occasioned. In the instant case, that the appellant would have been misled and that a failure of justice would have been occasioned was most apparent. The duplicity of charges would certainly have misled the appellant. The omission in not stating the presence of the appellant at the scene would have misled him to believe that the case to answer was not for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK>. Rather, the omission in not stating the presence of the appellant at the scene coupled with the error in stating that the appellant and Jayakumar discharged a firearm, could even have convinced the appellant that the case to answer was indeed for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK>. The charge for an offence - <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3.;;">s 3</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_37;3A.;;">s 3A</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> - is unknown in law. The conviction was a nullity. Clearly, there was a total failure in the administration of justice, which could only be put right by an order in favour of liberty of the subject.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It was for the aforesaid reasons that we allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence.</p>
