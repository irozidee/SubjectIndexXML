    <p>The respondent was a wholly owned subsidiary of Metroplex Bhd and the registered proprietor of a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur ('the land'). The respondent created a third party charge over the land in favour of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad ('BBMB') as security agent for a syndicate of banks which granted credit facilities to Metroplex Bhd under a guarantee facility agreement ('GFA'). The charge was subsequently transferred from BBMB to the appellant and the appellant assumed the role of security agent. Metroplex Bhd subsequently defaulted on the loan as a result of which the appellant successfully applied for an order for sale of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 National Land Code ('NLC')</LINK>. The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal but the appeal was dismissed. The land was then successfully sold by way of public auction to a company called OSK Trustee Bhd for RM513,945,000, and the company was registered as the proprietor of the land. However, it transpired that during the interim period prior to the auction sale, the respondent had filed an action against the appellant raising issues to show cause to the contrary. The learned judge dismissed the action on the ground that all issues of the charge being defective could not be raised in the action and should have been raised earlier in the application for the order for sale. The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal. The appellant now appealed before the Federal Court contending (1) that the appellant's appointment as the security agent was in contravention of cl 18(G) of the GFA and consequently, BBMB had no power to transfer the charge to the appellant and, (2) that the charge violated <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B NLC</LINK> in that six of the guarantors under the GFA were foreign companies which failed to obtain the requisite approval of the State Authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The instant action was a collateral attack of an order for sale that was regularly obtained and against which an appeal was dismissed. For it to be maintained, the critical issue was not whether there were grounds to impugn the charge but whether the order for sale was a contravention that defied a substantive statutory prohibition. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There were exceptions to the requirement that the prior approval of the State Authority must first be obtained. The relevant important exception was where the dealing was a land charge. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B(3) NLC</LINK> prior written approval of the State Authority was clearly not required where the dealing was a land charge. As such, it could not be contended that the charge violated <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B NLC</LINK>. The two strong grounds to impugn the charge were only over an alleged breach of cl 18(G) of the GFA, which even if true, was not a contravention that defied an express statutory prohibition. The conditions laid down in <i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> for a collateral action were not met. (paras 16-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was plain and obvious that the instant action was barred by the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>. Foreclosure proceedings result in the grant or refusal of an order for sale, and not in a judgment or decree. But an order for sale, once granted and unless set aside, was nonetheless a final order. When the appeal against the order for sale was dismissed and there was no further appeal, the stage was reached where the order for sale was fully adjudicated and could not be re-litigated. The order for sale could be re-litigated if it were a contravention that defied a substantive statutory prohibition. But there was no such contravention as could have permitted the respondent to bring an action in rem, an action raising only issues that should have been raised in the charge action. There was also no allegation that the order for sale was procured by fraud, which could have permitted a fresh action. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Issues pertaining and/or relating to "cause to the contrary" could only be raised in the charge action. A chargor was therefore barred from bringing a fresh action against a chargee, in order to raise issues which showed a "cause to the contrary", regardless of whether the chargor had or had not raised such issues at the stage of the chargee's application for an order for sale of the charged property under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 NLC</LINK>.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The question upon which leave was granted to appeal against the order of the Court of Appeal in respect of the matter decided by the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts are as follows. The respondent, a wholly owned subsidiary of Metroplex Berhad, was the registered proprietor of land held under Geran 10012 Lot 38, Seksyen 51, Bandar Kuala Lumpur (hereinafter referred to as Putra Place). In August 1993, the respondent created a third party charge over Putra Place in favour of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad (BBMB) as Security Agent for a syndicate of banks, in consideration of credit facilities granted by the said syndicate of banks to Metroplex Berhad. On 5 April 2002, the charge was transferred to Commerce International Merchant Bank (CIMB, as the appellant was formerly known) who had assumed the role of Security Agent for the said syndicate of banks.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Metroplex Berhad defaulted on the loan. In October 2005, CIMB filed a charge action (Kuala Lumpur High Court S1-24-2394-2005) against the respondent, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the National Land Code (NLC)</LINK>. The charge action was resisted by the respondent. On 16 July 2007, Wahab Patail J, as he then was, ordered the sale of Putra Place by public auction. The respondent appealed, but the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Putra Place was put on the auction block. Judicial sale was initially not successful. But on 30 March 2011 (that is, the fourth occasion that it was up for auction), Putra Place was successively sold to OSK Trustee Berhad (as Trustee for Sunway REIT) for RM513,945,000.00, who was registered as proprietor of Putra Place on 19 April 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Meantime, on 19 May 2009, that is, before auction sale of Putra Place to OSK Trustee Berhad, the respondent filed an action (the action below) against the appellant for the following reliefs.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The appellant applied to strike out the action pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;18.;;">O 18 r 19 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> (since replaced by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;;">Rules of Court 2012</LINK>). That was not the first time that the appellant had applied to strike out an action for those said reliefs. The trial court related that in Kuala Lumpur 22-177-2011 (Suit 177), Metroplex Berhad sought reliefs identical to the reliefs sought in the instant action, that the appellant applied to strike out Suit 177 on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that it was barred by the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> and by limitation, that Suit 177 was struck out (by the same trial court) on those grounds, and that the appeal against the striking out order was discontinued by Metroplex Berhad on or about 25 February 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> As for the instant striking out application, the trial court held (i) that in the charge action, the stand of the respondent was just to seek an extension of time to settle its debt which was admitted, and to seek a postponement of the charge action (see paras 37 and 38 of the judgment of the trial court), (ii) that the instant action was founded on an alleged fact - the charge was defective - that should have been raised in the charge action (see paras 34 and 35 of the judgment of the trial court), and, (iii) that the issue of limitation which was raised by the appellant but not replied thereto by the respondent who filed no affidavit to oppose the instant striking out application, was deemed admitted by the respondent. The trial court concluded that the instant action for the said reliefs was barred by the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> and by limitation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Court of Appeal tacitly agreed with the trial court that the instant action was founded on the alleged fact that the charge was defective. At para 11 of its judgment (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_4_478;"><i>Metroplex Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Commerce International Merchant Bankers Berhad</i> [2013] 4 MLRA 478</LINK>; [2013] 4 MLJ 520; [2013] 8 CLJ 329; [2013] 3 AMR 782), the Court of Appeal thus summed up the 'stand' of the respondent in the action below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Also, the Court of Appeal thus paraphrased paras 12 to 17 of the statement of claim which pertained to the assertion that the charge was defective:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As said, the trial court held that all issue of the charge being defective belonged to the charge action and could not be raised in the instant action. The Court of Appeal disagreed. The Court of Appeal held that the respondent's action "is predicated upon a cause of action that the charge created by the appellant over the land in favour of the respondent is not indefeasible within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2) of the NLC</LINK>", that "there was never a trust formed between the (respondent) and BBMB with regard to the charge, and that "the respondent came onto the register, as chargee of the land via a transfer from BBMB, according to the appellant, the transfer of the charge from BBMB to the respondent was obtained by means of an insufficient or void instrument. And it is this issue that should proceed for trial". In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there were two strong grounds to impugn the charge, namely (a) "BBMB had no power to appoint the (appellant) as the security agent because such a power was vested in the guarantee facility (agreement) as stipulated in cl 18(G) of the GFA"; and, (b) "the charge violated <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B of the NLC</LINK> in that six of the guarantors under the GFA were foreign companies which failed to obtain the requisite approval of the State Authority".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The fact that the result in the charge action, with dismissal of the appeal, had reached its terminus, failed to impress the Court of Appeal who held (i) on the purported 'authority' of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909, per Mohd Azmi FCJ, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1988_3_705;"><i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Syarikat Perumahan Luas Sdn Bhd (No 2)</i> [1988] 3 MLRH 705</LINK>; [1988] 3 MLJ 352b, per Edgar Joseph Jr J, as he then was, <i>Harkness v Bell's Asbestos And Engineering Ltd</i> [1967] 2 QB 729, 736 per Diplock LJ, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_507;"><i>Eu Finance Berhad v.

Ban Hin Lee Bank Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 491</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 77; [1997] 2 CLJ 36; [1997] 1 AMR 1036, per Gopal Sri Ram JCA, as he then was, delivering the judgment of the Federal Court, that the result in the charge action could be collaterally attacked, and, (ii) on the purported 'authority' of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_505;"><i>Kandiah Peter Kandiah v. Public Bank Bhd</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 505</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 119; [1993] 4 CLJ 332; [1993] 2 AMR 3464 "that the order for sale was not a judgment or a decree, and that consequently, neither <i>res judicata</i> nor cause of action estoppel nor issue estoppel could be invoked against the respondent". But what had those latter cases, particularly <i>Badiaddin</i> and <i>Kandiah Peter</i>, in fact espoused?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_196;"><i>Hew Hooi Chun v. KL Teksi Radio Bhd</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 196</LINK>; [2011] 3 MLJ 754; [2010] 4 CLJ 657, the Court of Appeal imparted the following commentary on <i>Badiaddin</i>, which we wholly adopt:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_5_175;"><i>Serac Asia Sdn Bhd v. Sepakat Insurance Brokers Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] 5 MLRA 175</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 1; [2013] 6 CLJ 673; [2013] 4 AMR 385, the Federal Court per Abdull Hamid Embong FCJ, delivering the judgment of the court, held that <i>Badiaddin</i> should be read in the following context:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The inherent jurisdiction to set aside, <i>ex debito justitiae</i>, orders regularly obtained is settled. Unless the order is a nullity in the sense as enunciated in <i>Badiaddin</i>, it could not be attacked in collateral proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The Court of Appeal held that there were two strong grounds to impugn the charge, namely (a) "BBMB had no power to appoint the (appellant) as the security agent because such a power was vested in the guarantee facility agent as stipulated in cl 18(G) of the GFA"; and, (b) "the charge violated <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B of the NLC</LINK> in that six of the guarantors under the GFA were foreign companies which failed to obtain the requisite approval of the State Authority". But with respect, the action below was a collateral attack of an order for sale that was regularly obtained and against which the appeal was dismissed. For the collateral attack, namely the instant action, to be maintained, let alone sustained, the critical particular was not whether there were grounds to impugn the charge but whether the order for sale was a contravention that defied a substantive statutory prohibition. But that critical particular was not present, not even arguably so, in the instant action. For even if it were true, the contravention of cl 18(G) of the GFA was plainly not a contravention that defied a substantive statutory prohibition. In fact, the contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B(1)(e) of the NLC</LINK>, was not even made out. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">Section 433B</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B(1)(b) of the NLC</LINK>, "a dealing under Division IV in alienated land may be effected in favour of a non-citizen or a foreign company". Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B(1)(c)</LINK>, "alienated land, or any share or interest in such land, may be transferred or transmitted to, or vested in, or created in favour of any person or body as "trustee", or of two or more persons or bodies as "trustees", where the trustee or one of the trustees, or where the beneficiary or one of the beneficiaries, is a non-citizen or a foreign company". And pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B(1)(e) of the NLC</LINK>, "the Registrar may endorse any memorial of transmission on the register document of title to any land in favour of a non-citizen or foreign company". Except that the prior approval of the State Authority must first be obtained upon an application in writing to the State Authority by such non-citizen or foreign company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Nevertheless, there are exceptions to the requirement that the prior approval of the State Authority must first be obtained. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B(1)</LINK>, "... no such approval shall be required in respect of (aa) any land or any interest in land which is subject to the category "industry" or to any condition requiring its use for industrial purposes; (ab) any dealing effected pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement for which an approval has been granted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433E.;;">s 433E</LINK> and executed by the same parties in such agreement; and (ac) any dealing or act with regard to alienated land or any interest in land exempted by rules made under para (aa) of subsection (1) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;14.;;">s 14</LINK>".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> One other important exception is where the dealing is a land charge. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">Section 433B(3) of the NLC</LINK> provides that "notwithstanding <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">subsection (1)</LINK>, but subject to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">subsection (4)</LINK>, it shall not be necessary for a non-citizen or a foreign company to obtain the approval of the State Authority for the purpose of a charge or a lien in respect of any alienated land or any undivided share in such land or any lease of such land under Part Sixteen". Hence, where the dealing is a land charge or lien, it shall not be necessary for a non-citizen or a foreign company to obtain the prior approval of the State Authority for the registration and endorsement of the charge. That too was the conclusion of the learned authors of <i>Land Law in Malaysia, Cases and Commentary</i> by Teo Keang Soo and Khaw Lake Tee, 2nd edn at p 694, who thus commented on the restrictions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B of the National Land Code</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Prior written approval of the State Authority is clearly not required where the dealing is a land charge. Since it was not required, it could not therefore be contended that "the (instant) charge violated <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433B.;;">s 433B</LINK> ... in that six of the guarantors under the GFA were foreign companies which failed to obtain the requisite approval of the State Authority". Really, in truth, the "two strong grounds to impugn the charge" only panned out to no more than an alleged breach of cl 18(G) of the GFA, which, even if true, was not a contravention that defied an express statutory prohibition, which meant that the conditions of <i>Badiaddin</i> for a collateral action were not met and that the respondent was therefore barred by the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> to bring the action below to attack the order for sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Court of Appeal yet held that the respondent was not barred by the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> to bring a fresh action against the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The Court of Appeal then closed the issue of <i>res judicata</i> in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b>
      <i>Kandiah Peter</i> and Low Lee Lian are often cited but also often misunderstood as to have held that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> has no application whatsoever in foreclosure proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In <i>Kandiah Peter</i>, the facts were as follows. The chargor failed to set aside orders for sale of the charged lands. In his action brought to declare that the charge was null and void, the chargor raised and relied on facts and issues which the trial judge found to be identical to those raised by the chargor in the foreclosure proceedings. The trial judge dismissed the chargor's claim on the ground that the matter was covered by the doctrines of estoppel and <i>res judicata</i>. The Federal Court agreed with the trial judge that the issues raised by the chargor in the foreclosure proceedings and in the fresh action were identical. The question before the Federal Court was whether the doctrines of issue estoppel or cause of action estoppel or <i>res judicata</i> were applicable in the circumstances to bar the chargor's fresh action. The Federal Court answered that "a chargee who makes an application for an order for sale in foreclosure proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the Code</LINK> does not commence an action", that foreclosure proceedings result not in a judgment or decree but in the grant or refusal of an order for sale, and that for the doctrines of <i>res judicata</i>, cause of action estoppel or issue estoppel to apply, the earlier proceedings must have resulted in a final judgment or decree.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It should be noted that in <i>Kandiah Peter</i>, the issues and facts relied by the chargor in the fresh action had been raised by the chargor in the foreclosure proceedings. It was in that context that the Federal Court pronounced that the issues raised by a chargor in the foreclosure proceedings, to show 'cause to the contrary', could be raised by the chargor in a fresh action.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b>
      <i>Low Lee Lian</i> was not a fresh action but an appeal by the chargor against the order for sale, who argued that the bank had varied the rate of interest without giving any notice of the same to the appellant and that the bank had, without the chargor's knowledge, permitted the third party to breach the terms of the agreement between them. The main question that arose was whether they constituted, even if the complaints were made out, sufficient reason for the refusal of an order for sale by establishing 'cause to the contrary' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256(3) of the National Land Code</LINK>. The Federal Court per Gopal Sri Ram JCA, as he then was, delivering the judgment of the court, took the opportunity to enunciate on 'cause to the contrary' and on the distinction between rights in <i>rem</i> and rights <i>in personam</i>. In relation the former, the Federal Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Thus having imparted the pertinent law, the Federal Court then pronounced that an action brought to set aside a charge upon one or more of the grounds of defeasibility specified under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK> is an action <i>in rem</i>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b>
      <i>Low Lee Lian</i> concurred with <i>Kandiah Peter</i> that foreclosure proceedings result not in a judgment or decree and that "the making of an order for sale upon the failure of a chargor to satisfy the court that there existed cause to the contrary did not bar a subsequent action <i>in personam</i> brought by the chargor based upon the same facts that did not avail him in opposing the application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256</LINK>". <i>Low Lee Lian</i> also pronounced, and we wholly agree, that "an action brought to set aside a charge upon one or more of the grounds of defeasibility specified under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the Code</LINK> is an action <i>in rem</i>". Hence, the action below for an declaration "that the charge is not indefeasible within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 340(2) of the National Land Code</LINK>, "that the charge is null and void", "that the charge, the instrument and the memorial are invalid", "that the charge, the instrument and the memorial be set aside", and, "that the order for sale dated 16 July 2007, the auction and other related orders in respect of the land made in the Kuala Lumpur High Court OS Proceedings (Suit No: S-24-2394-2005) be set aside", which attacked the indefeasibility of the charge, was not an action <i>in personam</i> but an action <i>in rem</i> and which could not be brought. <i>Kandiah Peter</i> pronounced that an action <i>in personam</i> could be brought, that is, if the action <i>in personam</i> is "based upon the same facts that did not avail (the chargor) in opposing the application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256</LINK>". But the present action was an action <i>in rem</i> that was based moreover on facts that were not raised in the foreclosure proceedings. Given so, <i>Kandiah Peter</i> could not apply, just as Badiaddin was wholly inapplicable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> With respect, it was so plain and obvious that the instant action was barred by the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>. Foreclosure proceedings result in the grant or refusal of an order for sale, and not in a judgment or decree. But an order for sale, once granted and unless set aside, is nonetheless a final order (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_255;"><i>Mui Bank Bhd v. Cheam Kim Yu</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 255</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 642; [1992] 1 CLJ 222, where it was held by the Federal Court that the order for sale, once drawn and perfected, was a final order). When the appeal against the instant order for sale was dismissed and there was no further appeal, the stage was reached where the instant order for sale had been fully adjudicated and therefore could not be re-litigated. The instant order for sale could be re-litigated if it were a contravention that defied a substantive statutory prohibition. But there was no such contravention as could have permitted the respondent to bring an action <i>in rem</i>, an action which raised only issues that should have been raised in the charge action. There was also no allegation that the order for sale was procured by fraud which could have permitted a fresh action. Under the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, the action below should have been struck out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For the above reasons, we answer the leave question in the affirmative and in the following terms: Issues pertaining and/or relating to 'cause to the contrary' could only be raised in the charge action. A chargor is therefore barred from bringing a fresh action against a chargee, in order to raise issues which show a 'cause to the contrary', regardless of whether the chargor had or had not raised such issues at the stage of the chargee's application for an order for sale of the charged property under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the National Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We unanimously allow this appeal with costs, and reinstate all orders of the trial court.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
