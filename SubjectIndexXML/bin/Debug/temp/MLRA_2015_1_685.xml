    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent commenced a civil suit ("the civil suit") against a debtor on 18 December 2000 based on a cause of action that arose against the debtor on 12 November 2000. The respondent thereafter engaged the services of the appellant solicitor to take over conduct of the civil suit. The suit was however struck out on 29 May 2006 when the appellant failed to attend court for trial. The respondent filed a negligence suit against the appellant on 4 October 2012 ("the negligence suit") concerning the appellant's failure to attend court on the hearing date. The High Court allowed the respondent's negligence suit and dismissed the appellant's defence of limitation. The appellant claimed that the cause of action in the negligence suit only arose on 29 May 2006 - when the civil suit was struck out - and hence the negligence suit would have been time-barred on 28 May 2012. The High Court however held that the respondent's cause of action against the appellant in the negligence suit accrued on 12 November 2006 - the date the civil suit against the debtor would become time barred - and hence the cause of action in the negligence suit would only expire on 12 November 2012. Since the negligence suit was filed on 4 October 2012, the action was well within the six years' limitation period prescribed in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Limitation Act 1953</LINK>. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The respondent cross-appealed against the award of interest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal but ordering costs to be paid by the appellant:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the cause of action for professional negligence arose when the civil suit was struck out on 29 May 2006. The respondent only commenced the negligence suit on 4 October 2012 after six years. The respondent's argument that although the civil suit was struck out on 29 May 2006, it could still be filed afresh or reinstated before it expired on 12 November 2006, had no merit. This was not a case of latent defect. (para 22(i)-(ii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Once the cause of action arose, the limitation period commenced and it could not be extended by way of speculation or surmise by stating that there was opportunity to refile or reinstate on or before 12 November 2006. In the instant case, the cause of action for negligence by the solicitor would arise immediately upon the suit being struck out. (para 22(iii)-(v))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant's submission on limitation as well as other issues had merit, although the High Court was correct in finding the appellant negligent. The cause of action in the instant case arose when the civil suit was struck out. (para 24)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's (defendant) appeal and the respondent's (plaintiff) cross-appeal which relates to professional negligence of solicitor in not attending court on the day of hearing which resulted in the suit being struck out came up for hearing on 7 April 2014 and 23 April 2014. Upon hearing the parties we reserved judgment. My learned brothers Mohamad Ariff Mohd Yusof JCA and Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim JCA have read the judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminaries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the outset we must say the learned judicial commissioner had dealt with the issues meticulously and written a comprehensive judgment. The complaint by the appellant is related to (i) the defence of limitation; and (ii) the allegation that the respondent has no reasonable prospect of success against SK Styrofoam (purported debtor) and therefore suffered no actual damage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondent's cross-appeal is related to the interest awarded on the judgment sum, which was 5% per annum but the respondent says it must be the contractual interest of 1.5% per month from 12 November 2000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Undisputed Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The cause of action against the purported debtor arose on 12 November 2000 and the action will become time barred on 12 November 2006. The striking out of the suit was done on 29 May 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The present suit was filed on 4 October 2012. The cause of action the appellant said arose on 29 May 2006 and it would have been time barred on 28 May 2012. However, the learned Judicial Commissioner says in negligence the cause of action only arises at the time the respondent suffers damage. And asserts further, that will only arise on 12 November 2006, ie when the opportunity to file afresh and/or reinstate is lost. That part of judgment reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Reasonable Prospect Of Success</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Before we deal with the case it must be noted that the law related to negligence of solicitor and assessment of quantum for reasonable prospect of success has always been challenging and one must be careful not to stride into indemnity principle as the measure for the failure of solicitor attending court and having the case struck out. There are many uncertainties and/or contingencies the court has to take into consideration in relation to the success of the client's case against third parties and also the conduct of the client in not pursuing the case by regularly not having his own diary to check the movement of the case from time to time. In this time and era, just to say that the case is being handled by the solicitor in litigation matter without knowing the status of case management or hearing dates and not taking keen interest in the litigation process may not end up in the court granting quantum on indemnity principle or near to it. It must not be forgotten litigation is a joint effort of the solicitor and client and both parties have to show interest in the litigation process or take necessary steps promptly to maintain their <i>status quo</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> There are authorities to suggest that in a case of this nature the respondent still has to prove his case against the third party on the balance of probabilities. This was not done in this case. In <i>Sharif &amp; Ors v. Garrett &amp; Company</i> [2002] 1 WLR 3118, the court with similar issues had relied on Lord Justice Simon Brown in <i>Mount v. Barker Austin</i> [1998] PNLR 510/511, where His Lordship had summarised the relevant consideration as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Limitation Defence And 'Reasonable Prospect Of Success'</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In negligence the cause of action starts from the date of damage is a good proposition of law but it may not apply to cases where you can sue for damages immediately. [See <i>Watkins v. Jones Maidment Wilson (A Firm)</i> [2008] EWCA Civ 134]. In a case for 'loss of chance to sue' there is no reason to defer the action. The status will be the same whether or not the action is deferred. The distinction is like apple and orange and we will deal with this issue further in the judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In addition, it must be noted when a matter is struck out there will be at least two types of damages for client. One is actual damage for costs to reinstate or refilling inclusive of instructing new solicitors to take conduct of the matter as the case may be and the other the 'loss of chance to sue'. To say 'actual damage' will not arise upon the case being struck out is a fact quite difficult to comprehend. However, on the 2nd part of 'loss of chance' there will not be any liability if there is no actual loss and/or reasonable prospect of success as advocated in the submission of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Rules Of Pleading</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> When limitation issues are taken, the pleadings must be meticulously looked into. In the instant case the respondent prayer in the statement of claim states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> From the pleadings it is clear that the respondent is seeking general damages. General damages will include costs involved to reinstate as well as quantum for 'reasonable prospect of success' in cases of this nature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> What is important to note is that the complaint is in reference to a number of dates in prayer 18(a) and one particular date where the respondent's admit the breach took place was on 29 May 2006 and nowhere in the pleaded case of the respondent has the date 12 November 2006 been mentioned for the trial court to endorse the claim and allow damages. [See <i>Blay v. Pollard &amp; Morris</i> [2930] 1 KB 628 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2008_1_304;"><i>Recaliva Design Steel (M) Sdn Bhd v. Vista Access Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2008] 1 MLRH 304</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 604; [2008] 10 CLJ 491]. That part of the judgment reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is trite judgment must reflect the pleadings and more so when 'limitation' is taken as an issue. Learned authors of <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 20th edn at p 2064 had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We have perused the pleadings several times but could not find the date 12 November 2006 in the statement of claim to enable the respondent to prove the cause of action falls within the limitation period. In our considered view it is fatal to the respondent's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The respondent's cause of action against the purported debtor is for works carried out by the respondent. The suit was filed on 18 December 2000 and the sum claimed was RM154,283.00 with interest and costs (First Suit).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The first suit was filed by a different solicitor and the matter was transferred to the appellant as solicitor to take conduct of the matter after the first solicitor was not able to obtain summary judgment on the sum claimed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The matter was fixed for trial on 29 May 2006 but the appellant as solicitor did not attend court and the matter was struck out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The first application to reinstate was only made by the appellant on 12 March 2009, ie about three years later and even that application was never heard on merits. For this purpose the appellant has filed an affidavit to state there was a good prospect of success. The learned Judicial Commissioner in his judgment has given great weight to this affidavit in finding the appellant liable to the full sum claimed by the plaintiff against the purported debtor. On the facts of the case taking into procedural consideration for reinstatement we do not think it should be taken against the appellant as the appellant has given reasons for doing so. On this issue the appellant also says the jurisprudence relating to 'reasonable prospect of success' was not considered and in consequence the judgment is perverse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> A second application was made to reinstate on 29 November 2010 but it was dismissed by the learned Sessions Judge on the grounds of inordinate delay.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The memorandum of appeal <i>inter alia</i> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The memorandum of appeal for the cross-appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We have read the appeal records and submissions of the parties in detail. The court is grateful to the learned counsel for the comprehensive submissions. After much consideration to the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent, we take the view the appeal must be allowed and the respondent's cross-appeal must be dismissed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned counsel on the issue of 'reasonable prospect of success' and 'loss of chance' says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We find the appellant's submission on limitation as well as other issues has merit, though the learned Judicial Commissioner was correct in finding the appellant negligent in his retainer, and the disciplinary board had dealt with the indiscipline. As we said earlier the learned Judicial Commissioner judgment was commendable even though there were no sufficient authorities to assist the trial court on the issue relating to when the cause of action will arise when the suit is struck out. We did not also have the benefit of local cases on point, but we are of the considered view that the cause of action such as the instant case will arise when the suit is struck out. The test really is whether or not the respondent could have initiated an action within the limitation period. In our considered view the respondent could have.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> For reasons stated above, we take the view the appeal must be allowed and the decision of the High Court must be set aside. This is a fit and proper case where the costs here and below should be paid by the appellant to the respondent on the basis that the appellant has been found negligent. We fix costs at RM100,000.00 here and below, to be paid by the appellant to the respondent. The deposit to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
