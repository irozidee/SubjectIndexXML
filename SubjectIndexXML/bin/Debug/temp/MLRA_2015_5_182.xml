    <p>Both appellants were jointly charged in the High Court for trafficking in cannabis. At the end of the trial, the trial judge found the appellants guilty and sentenced them to death; hence, this appeal. The main issue in this appeal concerned the admissibility of the chemist's report as evidence to prove that the subject matter of the charge was cannabis, a dangerous drug. The appellants submitted that there had been non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">399(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code ('CPC')</LINK> by the prosecution. Although the Deputy Public Prosecutor ('DPP') conceded that there was non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B of the CPC</LINK>, she argued that service of the chemist's report was properly done, on the basis that the appellants' counsel had no objection on the manner in which the chemist's report was served during case management and had not objected to the non-calling of the chemist during the trial ('the agreement'). Further, the DPP submitted that the requirement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of the CPC</LINK> had been complied with, since the chemist's report was tendered more than ten days before the commencement of the trial. Thus, the DPP submitted that the non-compliance had not occasioned a failure of justice and could be rectified by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK>, citing the case of <i>Nobies Weah Ezike v. PP ('Nobies's</i> case') in support of her proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In <i>Nobies</i>'s case, the trial judge admitted and considered the exhibits which were not yet properly admitted in evidence. Since it should not have been considered, the Court of Appeal ruled that the prosecution's case had to stand without those exhibits. Considering the oral testimony of the witnesses and the properly admitted exhibits, the Court of Appeal found that the prosecution had more than proved beyond reasonable doubt, the ingredients of the offence of trafficking in dangerous drugs. However, the instant appeal concerned the admissibility of the chemist's report, without which, there was no evidence of the dangerous drugs, ie cannabis, the very subject matter of the charge.

      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">Section 422 of the CPC</LINK> could only be invoked in instances where the non-compliance was in respect of procedural matters. However, the concern in this appeal was not merely procedural. Therefore, notwithstanding the agreement, the chemist's report was wrongly admitted and could not be cured under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK>. The agreement could not derogate from the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A(5)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B(2)(vi) and (6) of the CPC</LINK>, especially in criminal matters.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Both the appeals were heard together. The appellants were the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused respectively in the High Court at Shah Alam. They were charged for trafficking in dangerous drugs, to wit, 1834 grams of cannabis, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Inspector Saravanan a/l Diwanantong (SP2) had received information from one of his registered informers of a person by the name of Naveen peddling in drugs. The informer had given the details of the mobile number of Naveen. SP2 sprung into action. He appointed L/Kpl Kamarudin bin Mohd Latiff (SP1) to be the agent provocateur. In the presence of SP2, SP1 made a call to the mobile number and spoke to a person who admitted to be Naveen. A meeting was agreed to take place on the same day at 8.30pm at a stall near Crystal Crown Hotel in Port Klang.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At this meeting attended by SP1 and Naveen (identified as the 1<sup>st</sup> accused/ appellant), SP1 expressed his desire to purchase 2 kilograms of cannabis. After negotiation, the price was fixed at RM5,000.00 per kilogram. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was to call SP1 once the supply of the cannabis was available.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 18 January 2012, SP1 received a call from the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. SP1 was informed that supply was available. SP1 and the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant agreed to meet at a place called Restaurant Yunus. SP2 decided to be an additional agent provocateur by bringing the money. On reaching the designated place, SP1 went to meet the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant in the restaurant while SP2 remained in the car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At the restaurant the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant intimated to SP1 that the drugs will arrive shortly. Meanwhile SP1 brought the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant to the car to meet SP2. SP1 introduced SP2 to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant as his partner. A short while later another person (identified in court as the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused/appellant) came to the place where the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant and SP1 were standing, talking to SP2. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant introduced the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant as his friend. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant sat in the car with SP2 and had asked to see the money. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant had also asked to count the money. SP2 refused. SP2 asked for the drugs to be shown first. Thereupon the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant asked SP2 to drive him to the place where he had parked his motorcycle which was at a short distance away.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On reaching the place where the motorcycle was parked, the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant got down from the car followed by SP2. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant took a newspaper package from the motorcycle. At this point of time, the appellants were apprehended.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The contents of the newspaper package confirmed by the chemist to be cannabis, the subject matter of the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned trial judge found that both the appellants had acted in concert in trying to sell cannabis and that there was direct evidence of possession and trafficking of the dangerous drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In their evidence given under oath, the narration of events led by the prosecution was not denied by the appellants except insofar as the purpose of the meeting was concerned. It was the defence version that the purpose of the meeting was for the appellants to get a temporary job. For the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant, he had stated that the drugs were planted in his motorcycle rack.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The learned trial judge found that the defence was an afterthought and was nothing more than the appellants' desperate attempt to escape the gallows. The appellants were convicted and sentenced to death, hence the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We decided the appeal on only one issue submitted by learned counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, which submission was adopted by learned counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant. The issue concerned the admissibility of the evidence that the subject matter of the charge was cannabis, a dangerous drug.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Relevant to the issue is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In the instant appeal, what transpired was evident from the following judgment of the learned trial judge (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 3, p 564):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Apparent from the above judgment that the chemist was not called to testify, as during case management, it was agreed between the prosecution and defence counsel that the presence of the chemist be dispensed with. And due to the agreement between the parties, the chemist report was admitted by the trial judge. It was marked as exh P7 during case management (Rekod Rayuan Tambahan 2, p 5) and tendered during trial through the Investigating Officer, Inspector Billy Stephen (SP3).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was the submission of learned counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant that unless there was evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant agreed to the dispensation of the chemist, the chemist report remained inadmissible. Learned counsel relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> For ease of reference, we set out below the said provisions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> For the prosecution, learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) conceded that there was non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B of the CPC</LINK>. However, she argued that service of the chemist report was properly done, on the basis that defence counsel had taken no objections on the manner the chemist report was served during case management and had not objected to the noncalling of the chemist during the trial. Further, learned DPP submitted that the requirement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of the CPC</LINK> had been complied with, since the chemist report was tendered more than 10 days before the commencement of the trial. It was thus the submission of learned DPP that the non-compliance had not occasioned a failure of justice and that the non-compliance could be rectified by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was common ground that while a copy of the chemist report, exh P7 was tendered to defence counsel during case management, service of exh P7 was never effected on the accused persons/appellants. It was also common ground that while defence counsel agreed with the dispensation of the chemist, the written consent of the appellants in respect of the dispensation was absent. The admission of exh P7 during case management was similarly without the written consent of the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> With the above background, the issue for our determination was whether, in the absence of the written consent of the appellants as to the dispensation of the chemist, the appellants were bound by the agreement between the defence counsel and the prosecution during case management and whether such an agreement superseded the express provisions of the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Learned DPP contended that since the appellants were represented by counsel, it was the duty of counsel to object to the admissibility of the chemist report or to give notice to the prosecution for the chemist to testify, which counsel had not done either.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It stood to reason that since defence counsel was representing the appellants, whatever that was agreed to by learned counsel in the case management must have been upon the instructions or with the agreement of the appellants. We accepted that as a general scenario. In the instant appeal however, we are governed by the specific provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Apart from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B</LINK>, we have <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of the CPC</LINK>. It is settled law that the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of the CPC</LINK> is a condition precedent and if not complied with, the chemist's report cannot be admitted in evidence without calling the government chemist to produce it (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_178;"><i>Ooi Lean Chai v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 178</LINK>; [1991] 2 MLJ 552; [1991] 1 CLJ 337).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Coming back to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">172B</LINK>, it was our view that the provisions on the pre-trial conference and case management as provided under the said sections are provisions that ought to be strictly followed by the court. Where the language used in a statute is clear and unambiguous, the meaning must be accepted by the court. Once the literal meaning has been established, however inconvenient such meaning may be, it must receive its full effect (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_58;"><i>PP v. Tan Tatt Eek &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 685; [2005] 1 CLJ 713; [2005] 2 AMR 353).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Subsection (5) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">s 172A</LINK> stipulates that whatever matters agreed to by the prosecution and the defence must be agreed upon in writing by the accused. Subsection (2)(vi) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172B.;;">s 172B</LINK> provides that the admission of any exhibits is subject to the consent of the accused and his advocate while subsection (6) states that matters that have been reduced into writing and signed by the accused, his advocate and the prosecution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">subsection 172A(5)</LINK> shall be admissible in evidence at the trial of the accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Learned DPP cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_138;"><i>Nobies Weah Ezike v. PP</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 138</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 608; [2010] 1 CLJ 578 in support of her proposition that the error in the admission of the chemist report can be regularised under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK>. In particular, she highlighted the following passage in the judgment of Court of Appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In <i>Nobies</i>'s case, the trial judge admitted and considered the exhibits which were not yet properly admitted in evidence. Since it should not have been considered, the Court of Appeal ruled that the prosecution's case had to stand without those exhibits. Considering the oral testimony of the witnesses and the properly admitted exhibits, the Court of Appeal found that the prosecution had more than proved beyond reasonable doubt, the ingredients of the offence of trafficking in dangerous drugs. In the instant appeal, we were concerned with the chemist report, without which, there was no evidence on cannabis, the dangerous drug, the very subject matter of the charge. That, in our view, set the instant appeal and <i>Nobies</i>'s case apart.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> On the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422</LINK>, we were of the view that the section can be invoked in instances where the non-compliance were in respect of procedural matters whereas in the instant appeal, the concern was not merely procedural. We found support in the judgment of the Supreme Court in <i>Ooi Lean Chai (supra)</i> at p 180:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In the light of all the above, notwithstanding the agreement of or waiver by defence counsel during case management, we found that the chemist report, exh P7 was wrongly admitted, which wrongful admission could not be cured under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK>.
