    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the registration of a foreign arbitration award by the respondent in the High Court. The respondent obtained the award from the International Court of Arbitration in Paris. The arbitration stemmed from a dispute between the respondent and several other parties originating from an agreement to which the appellant was not a party. The arbitration tribunal had considered the issue and, based on the documents, ruled that the appellant was liable since the annexure to the agreement, which the appellant was signatory to, acknowledged the rights and obligations of the appellant under the agreement. The issues were: (i) whether the registration of the award was valid when the annexure to the arbitration was not produced before the court for registration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38 of the Arbitration Act 2005 ('the Act')</LINK>; and (ii) whether the award could be registered in the absence of the appellant's name in the arbitration agreement, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The parties relying on the Act must strictly comply with its provisions, more so when they were given exclusive privilege and benefit to register a foreign award that could only be challenged in limited circumstances as set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;39.;;">s 39 of the Act</LINK>. The doors for registration could not be widely opened by judicial fiat more so when it was not provided for by Parliament (<i>Taman Bandar Baru Masai Sdn Bhd v. Dindings Corporations Sdn Bhd</i>). (para 8(ii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondent's argument that the setting aside of the award could only take place pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;39.;;">s 39 of the Act</LINK> did not have merit when there were flaws in the registration of the award under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38</LINK>, more so when the mandatory requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38</LINK> was not complied with on the face of the record. In consequence, an award registered under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38</LINK> could be set aside as of right if the conditions stated in the section was not satisfied. There was no obligation to make an application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;39.;;">s 39</LINK> to set aside an award even though the applicant could satisfy one of the criteria in the said section. In addition, the law did not prohibit an application to be made both under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38</LINK> as well as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;39.;;">s 39</LINK>. (para 8(iii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The registration of the award on the facts of the instant case was <i>ab initio</i> a nullity and ought to be set aside as of right without any need for the appellant to rely on the provisos stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;39.;;">s 39</LINK> (<i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's (defendant's) appeal in respect of registration of foreign arbitration award came up for hearing on 28 April 2014 and upon hearing submissions, we reserved judgment to 26 June 2014. My learned brothers Abdul Wahab Patail JCA and Azahar Mohamed JCA have read the draft judgment. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent (plaintiff) had obtained a final award in its favour from the International Court of Arbitration in Paris under the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. It is not in dispute that the defendant is not a party to the agreement but the arbitration tribunal had considered the issue and based on the documents had ruled that the defendant is liable notwithstanding the defendant did not participate in the arbitration hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The learned trial judge had meticulously summarised the facts. To save judicial time we reproduce the facts which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The relevant sections of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;;">Arbitration Act 2005 (AA 2005)</LINK> which need consideration are <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">ss 9</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">38</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;39.;;">39</LINK>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The central issues before us are (i) whether the registration of the award was valid when the annexure to the arbitration was not produced before the court for purpose of registration of the award under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38 of the Act</LINK>; (ii) whether an award can be registered when the defendant's name does not appear in the arbitration agreement, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38</LINK> to be read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9 of the Arbitration Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned trial judge has articulated his views on these two issues and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The two issues which are glaringly obvious are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We have read the appeal record and the submissions of the parties in detail. We take the view the appeal should be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> For reasons stated above, we allow the appeal with costs. The registration of the award is set aside. Costs to be fixed at RM25,000.00 in the Court of Appeal and RM25,000.00 for the court below as agreed by the parties. Deposit to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
