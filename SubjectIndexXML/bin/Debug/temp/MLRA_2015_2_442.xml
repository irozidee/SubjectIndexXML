    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The 1st defendant company ("the company") was established by the deceased for the benefit of his wife - the 2nd defendant - and his children. The 2nd defendant held 26.67% of the shares. The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs together with a third company each held 21.21% of the shares for three of the deceased's sons. A fourth company - Wong Lan &amp; Daughters Sdn Bhd ("WLD") - held 9.7% of the shares for eight of the deceased's daughters. By notice dated 11 March 2013 from the 3rd defendant - the company secretary - the Directors of the 1st defendant were informed that the 2nd defendant had requested for the registration of the transfer of her shares in the company to WLD. The plaintiffs objected to the proposed transfer for non-compliance with art 37 of the articles of association, in particular subclausel (b) and (c) which required the 2nd defendant to make a general offer to existing shareholders on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. When the 3rd defendant confirmed that the 2nd defendant had executed a share transfer form in favour of WLD and had also deposited the relevant share certificates with her in purported compliance with art 37, the plaintiffs commenced the instant action in the High Court. They sought various declarative reliefs and injunctions to restrain the 2nd defendant. The High Court only allowed the plaintiff's action in part. The plaintiffs appealed against the decision dismissing part of their action (Appeal 1670) whereas the defendants appealed against the decision allowing the plaintiffs' action in part (Appeal 1831).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing Appeal 1831 but dismissing Appeal 1670 with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> A basic feature of registered companies is that their shares are freely transferable, and there is no power to refuse registration of a transfer unless the company's constitution gives a clear power to do so. In other words, there is a <i>prima facie</i> right for a shareholder to freely transfer his shares, which can only be altered by clear provisions to the contrary in the articles of association of the company. A restriction on transfer must therefore be clearly expressed in the articles of association of the company. It will not be implied by the courts. Any limitation on the right of transfer must be strictly construed. (paras 16-17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Article 37(b) contained an express prohibition against transfers of shares to persons who were non-members of the company. On a plain reading of art 37(b), it could not be said that the prohibition extended to transfers between members. Such interpretation would tantamount to giving subclause (b) a meaning wider than it would ordinarily bear. The provision was precise, plain and simple and there was no ambiguity in it. The court was not at liberty to re-draft the provision either by substituting, adding or altering the words used in the articles of association. If at all the maker of the articles had intended to cut down the right to transfer shares from a member to another member of the company, it would have inserted clear words to that effect. (para 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Article 37(c) began with language which was qualified in its application. The opening words in art 37(c) stated 'in order to ascertain whether any member or person selected as aforesaid is willing to purchase a share at the fair value'. Those words showed that subclause (c) was indeed a mechanism for ascertaining the fair value of shares referred to in subclause (b). If the mechanism prescribed in subclause (c) was of general application to cover all transfers, it would render the words 'to a person who is not a member' in subclause (b) redundant. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The High Court had erred in construing the pre-emption clauses in the instant case in the same manner as in <i>Loh Eng Leong &amp; Ors v. Lo Mu Sen &amp; Sons (Sdn) Bhd &amp; Anor</i>. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The pre-emptive requirement in the instant case was meant to apply in the context of sales of shares only. The purported transfer in the instant case was by way of gift. Therefore, it was not caught by art 37(c). (paras 23 &amp; 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> With regard to Appeal 1670, by virtue of the words "any member or any person selected by the directors" in art 37, there was no compulsion to make a general offer to all existing members. The option to purchase shares from a retiring member at fair value was not accorded to all members, but only to those selected by the directors. (para 27)</p>

      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Antecedents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> For ease of reference, we will refer to the parties in this appeal as they stood in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This appeal concerns the construction of articles of association of the company, in particular, the scope of such articles in giving preemption rights to shareholders in the event that a member wishes to transfer his shares to an existing member.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 21 March 2013, the plaintiffs applied to the High Court by way of an originating summons for the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 17 July 2013, the learned Judicial Commissioner granted prayers (a) and (b) above, but refused the other prayers in the originating summons. The plaintiffs appealed against the part of the decision of the High Court in refusing the other prayers, in particular, prayer (e). The plaintiffs' appeal was registered as J-02-1670-07-2013 (Appeal No 1670). The defendants' appealed against the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner in granting prayers (a) and (b). The defendants' appeal was registered as J-02-1831-08-2013 (Appeal No 1831). Both appeals were heard together.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed the Appeal No 1670 and allowed the Appeal No 1831. We now give our reasons for doing so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The facts in a nutshell are that the 1st defendant company was set up by one late Dato' Pang Kee Hwi for the benefit of his wife, ie the 2nd defendant and his children. The 2nd defendant held 299,202 shares (26.67%). The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs, together with one Ultimate Conglomerate Sdn Bhd, each held 238,000 shares (21.21%) for three of Dato' Pang's son. Another company, Wong Lan and Daughters Sdn Bhd, held 108,800 shares (9.7%) for eight of Dato' Pang's daughters.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> By notice dated 11 March 2013 from the 3rd defendant, who was the company secretary, the directors of the 1st defendant were informed that the 2nd defendant had requested for the registration of the transfer of her 299,202 shares in the company in favour of Wong Lan and Daughters Sdn Bhd. A circular resolution of the board of directors was also attached to the said notice for approval by the directors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Vide letter dated 11 March 2013, the plaintiffs objected to the proposed transfer for non-compliance with art 37 of the Articles of Association, in particular subclauses (b) and (c), which required the 2nd defendant to make a general offer to existing shareholders on a <i>pro rata </i>basis. The relevant subclauses are in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Vide letter dated 12 March 2013, the 3rd defendant confirmed that the 2nd defendant had executed a share transfer form in favour of the proposed transferee, and had also deposited the relevant share certificates with him, in purported compliance with art 37 of the Articles of Association.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The plaintiffs then filed originating summons and prayed for the declaratory reliefs as alluded to above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appeal No 1831</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The issue for determination in this appeal was whether the learned Judicial Commissioner was right in granting prayers (a) and (b) of the originating summons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner held that art 37 of the Articles of Association applied to the purported transfer from the 2nd defendant to the intended transferee. In reaching his decision, His Lordship found support in the case of<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_82;"><i>Loh Eng Leong &amp; Ors v. Lo Mu Sen &amp; Sons (Sdn) Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 82</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 253; [2002] 2 CLJ 184; [2002] 2 AMR 1593 (<i>Loh Eng Leong</i>), a decision of this court. In <i>Loh Eng Leong</i>, appellants were the 1st respondent company. They applied to the High Court, <i>inter alia</i>, to rectify the register of the company by striking out the name of the 2nd respondent as the holder of 161 shares in the company. They contended that the transfer of the shares to the 2nd respondent by another member of the company was done without prior notice to the company pursuant to art 21(b) of the company's Article of Association. Article 21 of the company's Articles of Association reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The learned trial judge in that case held that the provisions of art 21(b) were ambiguous, thereby dismissing the application. In allowing the appeal, this court held that art 21 applied to all transfers, be it to a member or a non-member of the company. The court had this to say at p 85:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[Emphasis Added]</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Analysing the general tone of the learned Judicial Commissioner's decision, it would appear that his lordship had adopted a liberal interpretation in holding that the pre-emptive requirement on transfer of shares imposed by art 37(b) should be construed to mean all transfers, be it from a member to another member, or from a member to a non-member. As the 2nd defendant had not complied with the condition precedents of art 37(b), the purported transfer from the 2nd defendant to Wong Lan &amp; Daughters Sdn Bhd was null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned counsel for the defendant had criticised the liberal interpretation adopted by the learned Judicial Commissioner and submitted that it was the wrong approach. He developed his submission by reference to the decision of English Court of Appeal in <i>Greenhalgh v. Malland and Others</i> [1943] 2 All ER 234 where Lord Greene MR enunciated the following principle:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We agreed with learned counsel for the defendant's submission. In our view, a basic feature of registered companies is that their shares are freely transferable, and there is no power to refuse registration of a transfer unless the company's constitution gives a clear power to do so. In other words, there is a <i>prima facie</i> right for a shareholder to freely transfer his shares, which can only be altered by clear provisions to the contrary in the articles of association of the company. A restriction on transfer must therefore be clearly expressed in the articles of association of the company, and it will not be implied by the courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Any limitation on the right of transfer must be strictly construed. As Robert R Pennington, <i>Company Law</i> (Butterworths, 8th edn 2001) states in relation to restrictions on the transferability of shares contained in a company's memorandum or Articles of Association at p 402:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Bearing the above principles in mind, we proceeded to consider the subclauses in the present case. Article 37(b) contains an express prohibition against transfers of shares to persons who are nonmembers of the company. On a plain reading of art 37(b), it could not be said that the prohibition extended to transfers between members. Such interpretation would tantamount to giving subclause (b) a meaning wider than it would ordinarily bear. The provision is precise, plain and simple and there is no ambiguity in it. The court was not at liberty to re-draft the provision either by substituting, adding or altering the words used in the Articles of Association. In our considered view, if at all the maker of the articles had intended to cut down the right to transfer shares from a member to another member of the company, it would have inserted clear words to that effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Further, art 37(c) begins with language which is qualified in its application. The opening words in art 37(c) states 'in order to ascertain whether any member or person selected as aforesaid is willing to purchase a share at the fair value'. These words told us that subclause (c) was indeed a mechanism for ascertaining the fair value of shares referred to in subclause (b). If that mechanism prescribed in subclause (c) was of general application to cover all transfers, it would render the words 'to a person who is not a member' in subclause (b) redundant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> With respect, we were of the considered view that the learned Judicial Commissioner had erred in construing the pre-emption clauses in the present case in the same manner as in <i>Loh Eng Leong</i>. Although <i>Loh Eng Leong</i> and the current case both concern pre-emption clauses, they were drafted in a completely different way.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> This court in <i>Loh Eng Leong</i> was not making an immutable statement of the law on the interpretation of pre-emption clauses. As observed by Abdul Kadir Sulaiman JCA (as he then was), in light of the words 'the person proposing to transfer any shares' in art 21(b), the preemptive requirement was automatic, except for transfer made pursuant to art 21(g), ie transfer from a deceased member to his executors or administrators; or transfer made pursuant to art 21(h) when the directors refused to register the proposed transfer. Further, the phrase 'no share shall be transferred to a person who is not a member so long as any member or any person selected by the directors as one whom it is desirable in the interests of the company to admit to membership' in art 21(a) can stand on its own and did not in any way narrow the effect of art 21(b). His lordship also stated that there might be a different consideration if the transfer made pursuant to art 21(a) was also included in art 21(b).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As stated earlier, in the present case, art 37(c) lays down directions as to the form of the sale notice and for ascertaining the fair value of shares which is referred to in art 37(b). This in itself called for a different consideration from <i>Loh Eng Leong</i>. It followed that under the provisions of art 37(b), where a share is desired to be transferred to one who is not a member of the company, the member entitled to transfer,must, as a first step, make a general offer to the other shareholders in the form of a sale notice pursuant to art 37(c). As the 2nd defendant was purported to transfer her shares to an existing member, the pre-emptive requirement could not be triggered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In our view, the pre-emptive requirement in the present case was meant to apply in the context of sales of the shares only. We referred to a New Zealand case,<i> Ord v. Calan Healthcare Properties Ltd</i> [2005] 2 NZLR 96 (<i>Ord</i>). In <i>Ord</i>, the appellant held the beneficial interest in shares in the respondent company, and the said shares were held on trust for the appellant by one Mr Akehurst. The appellant sought to transfer the legal title in the shares from Mr Akehurst to the new trustee. The question before the court was whether or not the pre-emption clauses applied. The clause reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The New Zealand Court of Appeal interpreted the above pre-emption clause and held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the present case, there was reference to a 'sale' of shares in art 37(c). A member is required to give a sale notice to the company that he desires to sell the same. The notice should also include the number of shares the retiring member desires to sell. As a matter of contractual interpretation, subclause (c) was meant to apply in the context of sales of shares. The purported transfer was by way of gift. Therefore, it was not caught by art 37(c).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The facts in <i>Loh Eng Leong</i> were different from the case before us as the transfer of shares was by way of sale. We, therefore, found that <i>Loh Eng Leong</i> was distinguishable from the case at hand and did not assist the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appeal No 1670</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The plaintiffs appealed against the part of the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner in refusing to order the 2nd defendant to offer her shares to all other shareholders on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Our short answer to this appeal was this. By virtue of the words "any member or any person selected by the directors" in art 37, there is no compulsion to make a general offer to all existing members. The option to purchase shares from a retiring member at fair value is not accorded to all members, but to those selected by the directors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Therefore, Appeal No 1670, must fail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In view of what had been stated above, Appeal No 1831 was allowed and Appeal No 1670 was dismissed with agreed costs of RM10,000.00. Deposits in both appeals were refunded.</p>
