    <p>The applicant owned a hotel and resort ("the old hotel") and had entered into a Collective Agreement dated 19 June 2003 ("the CA") with the respondent ("Union"). The applicant embarked on a major redevelopment and re-positioning of the old hotel which entailed a complete cessation of business and the closure of the old hotel from 1 December 2004. The employees of the old hotel were retrenched. The applicant thereafter entered into a Supplementary Agreement dated 13 January 2005 ("the SA") with the respondent and reopened its new hotel on 28 September 2006. The applicant begun a recruitment exercise and entered into contracts of employment with the employees on fresh terms. The Union took the view that the CA that was in force prior to the closing down of the hotel ought to govern the employment terms with the new employees. The applicant disagreed and applied to the Industrial Court for interpretation of the SA. The Industrial Court decided that, instead of the SA, the CA dated 19 June 2003 be and that the old terms and conditions of employment and organisational structure would apply. The applicant applied to the High Court for judicial review, which quashed the award of the Industrial Court. The High Court granted the applicant a declaration <i>inter alia</i>, that pursuant to cl 2.1(d)(i) and (iii) and cl 3.1 of the SA, the applicant was entitled to set new terms and conditions of employment and organisational structures, categories and positions and such new terms were to be the terms of the collective agreement in force for the Hotel. The Union appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vernon Ong JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In 2006, an application was filed by Shangri-La Hotels (Malaysia) Berhad for the interpretation of a Supplementary Agreement dated 13 January 2005 entered into between the respondent Hotel and the National Union of Hotel, Bar and Restaurant Workers Peninsular Malaysia. On 8 April 2011, the Industrial Court handed down its award to the effect that, instead of the Supplementary Agreement, the Collective Agreement dated 19 June 2003 applied and that the old terms and conditions of employment and organisational structure will apply upon the re-opening of the new hotel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Dissatisfied, Shangri-La Hotel filed an application to the High Court for judicial review of the Industrial Court award. On 30 July 2012, the learned High Court Judge granted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The National Union of Hotel, Bar and Restaurant Workers Peninsular Malaysia being dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court appealed to the Court of Appeal. On 2 September 2014, we dismissed the appeal after having heard counsel of the parties. We now set out the grounds of our decision. For convenience, the appellant shall be referred as the Union and the respondent as the Hotel respectively in the Grounds of Judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Account Of The Salient Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The factual background of this case has been concisely summarised by the learned High Court Judge and they are reproduced below.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Principal Issue For Determination</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> This appeal turns on the interpretation of cl 2.1(d) &amp; (e) and cl 3 of the Supplementary Agreement; in particular whether the said clauses ought to be read harmoniously, and if not, whether cl 2.1(d) &amp; (e) or cl 3.1 should prevail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Union's Argument</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The Union's argument is that the clauses in question ought to be read harmoniously; and that consequently, upon the re-opening of the resort, the Supplementary Agreement becomes null and void and the Collective Agreement and the old terms and conditions of employment will continue to apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Learned counsel for the Union submitted that in construing a collective agreement, the court ought not to be overly legalistic in its approach in trying to decipher the true intent of the contracting parties and that it was important to bear in mind that it was not a commercial agreement. In support of her proposition, she cited <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_304;"><i>Kesatuan Pekerja-Pekerja Perkayuan v. Syarikat Jengka Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 1 MELR 304</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_471;">[1996] 2 MLRA 471</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 464; [1997] 2 CLJ 276; [1997] 1 AMR 133 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2003_1_10;"><i>National Union Of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers, Peninsular Malaysia v. Tanjong Jara Beach Hotel Sdn Bhd</i> [2003] 1 MELR 10</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_307;">[2003] 1 MLRA 307</LINK>; [2003] 3 MLJ 49; [2003] 3 CLJ 330; [2003] 4 AMR 538. The ordinary rules of construction do not apply because of the special provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 (IRA 1967)</LINK>. In construing the clauses in question the court should act according to equity, good conscience and substantial merits of the case while at the same time not be bound by technicalities and legal form.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Firstly, it was submitted that the learned High Court Judge wrongly quashed the Industrial Court award because there was no basis to depart from the principles of interpretation laid down in <i>Jengka (supra)</i> for the interpretation of a collective agreement. There is no evidence that the Supplementary Agreement was prepared with the assistance of a senior and experienced lawyer who acted for the Union.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Secondly, even applying the ordinary rules of construction, cl 3.1 ought to prevail. Learned counsel adverted to the established principles of construction which were summed up in <i>Australian Broadcasting Commission v. Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd</i> [1973] 129 CLR 99 at 109 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Learned counsel submitted that the Supplementary Agreement envisages the continued role of the Union upon the re-opening of the hotel and was intended to settle the trade dispute concerning increased retrenchment benefits as set out in cl 1. Clause 3.1 is unambiguous and can be read harmoniously with cl 2.1. As such, it would be reasonable to interpret the clauses in question to mean that upon re-opening of the new hotel, the Collective Agreement will continue to apply but subject to the Hotel's right to introduce and negotiate new terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Learned counsel also argued that the learned High Court Judge erred in relying on the rule in <i>Forbes v. Git</i> [1922] 1 AC 256 to the effect that an earlier clause will prevail over a later clause if that later clause destroys the obligation created in the earlier clause. She submitted that cl 3.1 can be read as qualifying rather than destroying the effect of cl 2.1. Further, this rule is a very technical rule, which application directly contradicts with the intent and meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the IRA 1967</LINK> and hence should not be relied upon in an industrial law dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Thirdly, learned counsel argued that the Industrial Court award was not irrational or illegal and contained no errors of law. The Industrial Court was correct in applying the <i>Jengka's (supra)</i> principles of interpretation. The fact that the learned High Court Judge would have come to a different interpretation does not justify him disturbing the findings of the Industrial Court unless it is grounded on irrationality or illegality (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2003_1_21;"><i>Petroliam Nasional Bhd v. Nik Ramli Nik Hassan</i> [2003] 1 MELR 21</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_2_114;">[2003] 2 MLRA 114</LINK>; [2004] 2 MLJ 288; [2003] 4 CLJ 625 at p 115).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In short, it is the Union's case that under the Supplementary Agreement, upon the re-opening of the new hotel, the Supplementary Agreement becomes null and void and the Collective Agreement will continue to apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Hotel's Argument</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The Hotel's argument is that clauses in question are inherently contradictory clauses and cannot be read harmoniously. Clause 2.1 of the Supplementary Agreement ought to prevail so that upon the re-opening of the resort, new terms and conditions as determined by the Hotel would apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Firstly, learned counsel for the Hotel submitted that the learned High Court Judge had correctly construed the Supplementary Agreement, taking into account the facts and circumstances and the real purpose and intention of the parties in entering the Supplementary Agreement. The redevelopment exercise undertaken by the Hotel involved a complete cessation of business and closure of the hotel for a period of more than 18 months which led to the unavoidable retrenchment of employees of the hotel. Under the Supplementary Agreement, the parties reached a compromise whereby the Hotel offered improved retrenchment benefits and agreed to make available 100 job offers to the employees of the old hotel on new terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was submitted that cl 2.1(d)(i) and (ii) clearly stipulates the right of the Hotel to set new terms and conditions of employment and to determine the organisational structure, category and positions upon the re-opening of the hotel. As such, the collective agreement referred to and envisaged in cl 3.1 would be the collective agreement embodying the new terms and conditions and organisational structure as provided under cl 2.1(d).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Secondly, learned counsel argued that on the face of it, cl 2.1(d) and cl 3.1 are inconsistent and contradictory of each other. As such, the legal principles of interpretation applicable are as stated by Kim Lewison in "<i>Interpretation of Contracts</i>" at s 8.08 on "<i>Internal Inconsistency</i>" at pp 245-48. In summary, the principles may be stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Learned counsel submitted that cl 3.1 ought to be rejected because it completely defeats the intention of the parties. The Union and the Hotel had bargained and reached a compromise, whereby the Hotel offered improved retrenchment benefits totalling RM21 million and agreed to give 100 job offers on new terms and conditions, to enable the Hotel to undertake the redevelopment exercise. The Hotel spent approximately RM98 million for the redevelopment exercise, which entailed adopting a new business model with new terms and conditions and organisational structure for it to be viable and sustainable in the long term. To revert to the terms of the CA would have defeated the entire spirit and purpose of the Supplementary Agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As such, it was submitted that the court in interpreting the contradictory clauses, should give effect to cl 2.1(d) which carries into effect the real intention of the parties and should reject cl 3.1 which is repugnant and defeats the entire purpose and intention of the parties in entering into the SA (<i>Forbes v. Git (supra)</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Thirdly, learned counsel also submitted that cl 3.1 is a general clause whereas cl 2.1(d) is a specific clause. As such, the court should apply the principle "<i>generalia non derogant specialibus</i>" which means that the general words do not derogate from particular words. Therefore, the specific cl 2.1(d) should be given precedence over the general cl 3.1 (Kim Lewison in "<i>Interpretation of Contracts</i>" on "<i>Inconsistency with Main Object</i>" at s 8.09 at pp 248-249).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We have considered the points canvassed by learned counsel of the parties in their oral and written submissions. We have also carefully considered the learned High Court Judge's Grounds of Judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The learned High Court Judge had adverted to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Jengka (supra)</i> where Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) said that in construing the collective agreement, the court ought not to be overly legalistic in its approach in trying to decipher the true intent of the contracting parties and that it was important to bear in mind that it was not a commercial agreement. The fact that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the IRA 1967</LINK> was referred to was an indication that it should be tempered with equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case while at the same time not be bound by technicalities and legal form.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Be that as it may, the learned High Court Judge adopted the approach on the basis that social justice in labour jurisprudence is to dispense justice to the deserving party in a dispute. Like all other notions of justice, it favours the party who is in the right. The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA 1967</LINK> is designed to ensure social justice to both employers and employees. Social justice is not to be administered as a monopoly of the employees to the exclusion of the employer. Social justice is to be meted out just as much as it is to be done for the employer (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2007_1_26;"><i>Chan Hock Liong v. Associated Motor Industries (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2007] 1 MELR 26</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_873;">[2007] 1 MLRA 873</LINK>; [2007] 6 MLJ 323; [2007] 5 CLJ 298).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We agree with the learned High Court Judge that the task of construing the Supplementary Agreement should be undertaken with an appreciation of the factual background. In this case, the redevelopment exercise was a major undertaking. It required the complete cessation of business and the closure of the hotel for a period of 19 months (from 1 December 2004 until it re-opened on 28 September 2006) and the retrenchment of the employees of the old hotel. Meanwhile, in May 2006 the Hotel commenced the recruitment of employees for the new hotel. Thereafter, the Hotel entered into contracts of employment with the employees of the new hotel on fresh terms of employment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The learned High Court Judge correctly decided on the premise that each case would have to be weighed on its own set of facts on an equal footing, especially so in a case where both parties were on an apparent footing and had been dealing with each other at arm's length. He observed that the two parties have been negotiating collective agreements between them for 10 years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We also agree with the learned High Court Judge that read in isolation, the clauses in question was clear on their intent of each of the parties. Read together, they bring uncertainty in deciphering what the real intent of the parties was. Clause 3.1 cannot stand because it defeats the intention of the parties. The Hotel and the Union negotiated and agreed on a compromise for the redevelopment exercise. Under the Supplementary Agreement, the Hotel agreed to offer improved retrenchment benefits totalling RM20 million and further agreed to ensure a minimum of 100 job offers on new terms and conditions. The Hotel spent about RM98 million for the redevelopment exercise which entailed adopting a new business model with new terms and conditions and organisational structure for it to be viable and sustainable in the long term. To revert to the old Collective Agreement would have defeated the entire spirit and intent of the Supplementary Agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In our view, the learned High Court Judge adopted the correct approach in interpreting the contradictory clauses where he held that effect should be given to cl 2.1(d) which carries the real intention of the parties. Clause 3.1 was rejected because it is repugnant and defeats the entire purpose and intention of the parties in entering into the Supplementary Agreement (<i>Forbes v. Git (supra)</i>; <i>Nicolene v. Simmonds</i> [1953] 1 QB 543; <i>Walker v. Giles</i> [1848] 6 CB 662; <i>Totara Investments Ltd v. Crismac Ltd and Ulster Ltd</i> [2010] NZSC 36).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we are of the considered view that there are no merits in the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed with costs of RM10,000.00.</p>
