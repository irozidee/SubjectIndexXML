    <p>This was an appeal by the Inspector General of Police Malaysia ('IGP') against the decision of the High Court allowing the respondent's application for a <i>mandamus</i> to compel him (the IGP) to execute a warrant of committal and a recovery order against the respondent's husband. The warrant of committal was issued by the High Court against the husband for failure to comply with a High Court order to deliver the couple's youngest child to the respondent who was granted custody of the couple's three children following the husband's conversion to Islam. The recovery order under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;;">Child Act 2001 ('CA 2001')</LINK> was issued by the High Court directing the police to investigate and determine the whereabouts of the husband and the child and to obtain custody of the child from any place where she might be found. The Court of Appeal had struck out the husband's appeal against the warrant of committal and the recovery order. However, the IGP refused to execute the warrant of committal and recovery order on the ground that there were two conflicting court orders, ie an earlier Syariah Court order granting custody to the husband and the High Court order granting custody to the respondent. The IGP took the position that he would be in contempt of the Syariah Court if he were to execute the warrant of committal and the recovery order. Hence, the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal by majority</p>
    <p>Per Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA with Ahmadi Asnawi JCA concurring:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> An order of <i>mandamus</i> could be issued against the IGP in an appropriate case and with proper exercise of the judicial discretion by the court. The civil High Court had the power to grant prerogative writs including a writ of <i>mandamus</i> under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;25.;;">subsection 25(2) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">Section 20(1) and (3) of the Police Act 1967 ('PA 1967')</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> of the same empowered and imposed a duty on a police officer to maintain law and order and to apprehend and prosecute offenders. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f) of the PA 1967</LINK>, a police officer was under a duty to execute summonses, subpoenas, warrants, commitments and other processes lawfully issued by any competent authority. The IGP being the officer in charge of the police and its most superior commander might be directed by a competent authority to carry out the duty imposed on a police officer under his command. Therefore, where there was a legal public duty to do an act by an authority, an order of <i>mandamus</i> might be issued against that authority to carry out that public duty if such authority had refused to do so. (paras 14-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution ('FC')</LINK>, the High Courts in Malaya and in Sabah and Sarawak did not have jurisdiction in respect of any matter within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. The emphasis was on whether the subject matter of the action was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court and the burden was on the person (who wanted the Syariah Court or the High Court to make an order in his or her favour) to satisfy the court in that respect. As such, it was for the husband to show to the High Court that the issue of custody was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court and that the civil High Court could not and should not make any order on the custody of the children as that would be in conflict with the already existing order obtained by him from the Syariah Court. (paras 18-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was no automatic or immediate dissolution of the civil marriage upon a spouse's conversion to Islam. The respondent's civil marriage to her husband was still valid and subsisting. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;51.;;">s 51 of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>, a non-Muslim wife who had not converted to Islam, might upon the husband's conversion to Islam, apply to the civil court for custody, care and maintenance of the children even without filing for the dissolution of the civil marriage. The issue of custody of children of a civil marriage where one party had converted to Islam was not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. The non-Muslim party to the civil marriage might file an application in the civil court for the custody of the children and the civil court in appropriate cases might grant the custody order. Based on the Federal Court case of <i>Subashini Rajasingam v. Saravanan Thangathoray &amp; Other Appeals</i>, the High Court had the jurisdiction to grant the custody order in this case. (paras 24-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The principal question in this appeal was not on the validity of the High Court or the Syariah Court orders but whether the order of <i>mandamus</i> ought to have been issued against the IGP. The dispute herein was between two private parties involving a private and personal right of one party over the other. Public policy militated against the use of public resources such as the IGP and the police force to enforce private rights as opposed to public rights when private rights did not affect the public at large. The respondent was not without remedy as she had the committal order. With the assistance of the court bailiff, she could execute the order against the husband. (paras 28-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> An order of <i>mandamus</i> was a discretionary order and should not be readily issued when the parties in enforcing private rights, had a remedy. The respondent had the remedy of executing the committal order granted by the High Court. Also, the IGP had discretion in the matter to enforce a personal and private right as opposed to the enforcement of a public right. The duty and powers imposed on and given to the police under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(1) and (3)(f) of the PA 1967</LINK> must be read in the context of the general duty of the police to maintain law and order and the preservation of peace and security of Malaysia and prevention of crimes under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> of the same. Those were public duties of the police. Enforcement of court processes involving private rights did not come within the scope of public duties. In the circumstances, the order of <i>mandamus</i> should be discharged on the ground of public policy. (paras 31-37)</p>
    <p>Per Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA (dissenting):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> By the judgment in <i>Subashini Rajasingam v. Saravanan Thangathoray &amp; Other Appeals</i>, it was now settled that the civil High Court was the court having jurisdiction to deal with the custody of the child born out of a civil marriage. The custody order issued by the High Court was thus a valid order. The committal order and the recovery order that emanated from the custody order were valid orders. The respondent had lawful custody of the child, and that position of the law did not in any way change the position of the Syariah Court and the civil High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the FC</LINK>. (para 56)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Whilst the present case commenced as a private dispute in a civil matter, the police was now thrust into the dispute by the application of the law. The involvement of the police did not relate purely to the rights of the husband and the respondent, but also to the administration of justice as a whole. (para 57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> One of the general duties of the police as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f) of the PA 1967</LINK> was to execute summonses, subpoenas, warrants, commitments and other processes lawfully issued by any competent authority. Flowing from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f)</LINK>, it was thus the statutory duty of the police to execute the warrant of committal and the recovery order issued by the High Court. It was not the IGP's position that it was not the duty of the police to execute the warrant of committal and the recovery order or that it was the discretion of the police whether or not to execute the said orders. Neither did the IGP assert that the mother had not at any time approached the police for assistance before filing the application for judicial review. The challenge by the IGP was premised on the existence of the Syariah Court order and that the recovery order was beyond the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">s 53 of the CA 2001</LINK>, as the father was also considered the lawful guardian. (para 58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The argument that the police ought not to intervene and the parties should reconcile was not sustainable as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">s 53(3)(d) of the CA 2001</LINK> would be rendered otiose. The law relating to the granting of an order of <i>mandamus</i> was settled. <i>Mandamus</i> secured the performance of a public duty in which an applicant had sufficient legal interest to the performance. (paras 61-62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The learned judge properly exercised the remedial jurisdiction in granting <i>mandamus</i> against the IGP. The learned judge alluded to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f)</LINK> and to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;3.;;">s 3(3) of the PA 1967</LINK>. There was no appealable error committed by the learned judge that warranted appellate intervention. (paras 63-67)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The respondent had a legal right to the child. That right was determined by the High Court. The warrant of committal was not cancelled and the recovery order was not set aside. The IGP had a clear duty under the law to execute the warrant of committal to apprehend the husband and to give effect to the recovery order. The committal order and the recovery order was the final remedy available to the mother to recover the child. There was no other avenue that the mother could resort to. (para 68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The warrant of committal and the recovery order issued by the High Court were valid orders. There was no order from the Syariah Court requiring the police to perform any act or duty as opposed to the warrant of committal and recovery orders issued by the High Court that were specifically directed to the police. The IGP took into account irrelevant considerations and acted unreasonably in refusing to execute the warrant of committal and the recovery order. In the circumstances, the order of <i>mandamus</i> should be granted to enable justice to be done and it followed that the appeal should be dismissed with no order as to costs. (paras 69-70)</p>

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The respondent and one Pathmanathan were married according to the civil law marriage. They have three children. Subsequently, on 11 March 2009 Pathmanathan, the husband converted to Islam and became a Muslim. There was a tussle for the custody of the three children. Pathmanathan went to the Syariah High Court Ipoh and obtained an <i>ex parte</i> interim custody order of all the three children on 8 April 2009 and obtained a permanent custody order on 29 September 2009. However, Pathmanathan, (the husband) did not serve the Syariah Order on the respondent and neither did he take any action to enforce the Order. The Syariah High Court order contains an endorsement for compliance within 14 days of service of the order and non-compliance will amount to contempt of court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In the meantime, the respondent filed an application in the High Court Ipoh for custody of the three children under the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>; and on 11 March 2010 the High Court at Ipoh granted the respondent the custody of the three children. Pathmanathan was a party (he was the respondent) to the application for custody before the High Court. The respondent served the order on Pathmanathan but the latter failed to comply with the order to surrender the three children to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We were informed by counsel for the respondent that the two eldest children had all the while, even at the time when the Syariah Court made the order for custody, were with the respondent. The only child that was with Pathmanathan at the material time and for the purpose of the appeal, is the youngest child (Prasana Diksa - Birth Certificate No B214511) of the three children that goes by her Muslim name of Umu Habibah ("Habibah"), who was taken away by Pathmanathan from the respondent without her consent on 31 March 2009. Because of the failure by Pathmanathan to hand over Habibah to the respondent, the latter applied to, and obtained from, the High Court at Ipoh a committal order against Pathmanathan for failure to comply with the High Court Order of 11 March 2010. The committal order also contained a provision requiring the bailiff and a police officer to execute the order. At the same time, the respondent also obtained a recovery order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">s 53 of the Child Act 2001</LINK> directed at the bailiff and a police officer to go to the premises of Pathmanathan to search and take custody of Habibah. Pathmanathan was also represented at the hearing of the recovery order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> However, no action was taken by the police to execute the two orders namely, the committal order and the recovery order which were both dated 30 May 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It appears from the fact of the case that the Inspector General of Police (IGP) had publicly made a statement (which were widely reported in the printed media in the country) that the police will not take any action to arrest Pathmanathan or to secure the custody of Habibah because of the IGP's perception that there were two conflicting orders as to the custody of the children - the first order was by the Syariah High Court Ipoh dated 29 September 2009 ("the Syariah Order") and the second order was by the High Court at Ipoh dated 11 March 2010 ("the High Court Order").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Consequently, the respondent applied to the High Court at Ipoh for a judicial review for an order of <i>mandamus</i> to be issued and directed at the IGP commanding the IGP to execute the two High Court Orders namely, the recovery order and the committal order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> This is an appeal by the IGP against that order of <i>mandamus</i> issued by the High Court at Ipoh. The sole issue for our determination is whether the order of <i>mandamus</i> was correctly issued and whether the learned High Court Judge had judiciously and properly exercised his discretion in making the order, an order of <i>mandamus</i> being a prerogative order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It is trite law that an order of <i>mandamus</i> is issued whenever there is a public duty imposed in law on a person or body and the purpose of the order is to compel that person or body to carry out the duty required by law to be performed by him or by it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At this juncture and before we discuss the merit of the appeal, we will take note of the following facts which are not in dispute: (a) Pathmanathan, the husband, was represented and participated in the application for custody by the respondent in the High Court at Ipoh; (b) In that same proceedings the issue of the existence of the Syariah Order was raised and canvassed; (c) Pathmanathan appealed against that order to the Court of Appeal but the appeal was struck off on technicality, in that Pathmanathan as the appellant had failed to file any appeal record for the appeal; (d) Pathmanathan also filed an appeal against the committal and the recovery orders but again the appeal was dismissed on technical ground for the same reason that the appellant/ Pathmanathan had failed to file any appeal record for the appeal; (e) The IGP had filed an application to intervene in the appeal as to the committal and recovery orders; but because the main appeal by Pathmanathan was struck off, the IGP's application to intervene accordingly fails; (f) the Syariah Order does have an endorsement but does not contain any direction to the bailiff or a police officer to effect enforcement whereas the High Court Orders contained that direction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Now, we address the submissions by counsel in this appeal. Learned Senior Federal Counsel Encik Nor Hisham argued that the order of <i>mandamus</i> was bad because it was impossible to be enforced due to the presence of two conflicting custody orders, ie the Syariah Order and the High Court Order. He submitted that the learned High Court Judge in granting the custody order on 11 March 2010 had committed a serious error of law in that the learned High Court Judge had ruled that the Syariah Order was invalid and therefore irrelevant for consideration in deciding the application for custody by the respondent. Impliedly therefore the learned Senior Federal Counsel submitted that because the learned High Court Judge had erroneously held that the Syariah Order was invalid, therefore the exercise of discretion to order the issuance of order of <i>mandamus</i> was wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Secondly, the learned Senior Federal Counsel also submitted that the matter before us arises from a private dispute between the parties namely, the wife, (ie the respondent) and Pathmanathan (the husband) as to the custody of the three children out of their civil marriage. It was further submitted that though the IGP was not able to challenge the granting of the recovery order and the committal order because the appeal by Pathmanathan, ie the husband was struck off on technicality, the appellant, (ie the IGP) in this appeal can still challenge that validity of the order of <i>mandamus</i> in a collateral attack against the custody order by the High Court on two grounds. First, that the recovery order was made beyond the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">s 53 of the Child Act 2001</LINK> and secondly the existence of the Syariah Order which is an order by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> For the respondent it was submitted that firstly, there was no conflicting court orders. The Syariah Court is not a court of parallel jurisdiction with the civil High Court; but a court of exclusive jurisdiction in that its jurisdiction is exclusively applicable to Muslim and practicing the precepts of Islam. The civil High Court jurisdiction however covers all - Muslim and non-Muslim - except when it comes to matters relating to the practice and teaching of Islam. Secondly, it was submitted that the children in this case are children begotten out of a civil marriage between two non-Muslims under the civil <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act of 1976</LINK> and therefore any issue as to the custody of the children can be dealt with by the civil High Court. Thirdly, the respondent being a non-Muslim cannot go to the Syariah Court to get custody of the children because the Syariah Court has no jurisdiction over her. The respondent however can go to the civil High Court for custody of her children from the marriage with Pathmanathan. Though Pathmanathan had embraced Islam and is now a Muslim, it does not prevent him from submitting to the jurisdiction of the civil High Court. In fact the civil High Court always has jurisdiction over him on the matter because the children were the children of civil marriage. On the contrary, the respondent, being non-Muslim has no obligation to submit herself to the Syariah Court jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining the custody of her children. It was submitted before us that even if the respondent were to agree to submit herself to jurisdiction of the Syariah Court, in law the consent of party does not confer jurisdiction on the Syariah Court to try the matter when the Syariah Court does not have the jurisdiction in the first place. Fourthly, if the order of <i>mandamus</i> is not granted the respondent, being a non-Muslim, will have no remedy in so far as it relates to the custody of her children and that she as a mother will forever be condemned to never see her children again (in this case her daughter Habibah). The non- granting of the order of <i>mandamus</i> would also mean that the recalcitrant ex-husband (Pathmanathan) will remain in contempt of court and continue to commit an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;52.;;">s 52(1) of the Child Act 2001</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Opinion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is pertinent to take note that in this appeal all parties agreed that on principle an order of <i>mandamus</i> can be issued against the IGP in an appropriate case and with proper exercise of the judicial discretion by the court. Nevertheless, we would reiterate that the civil High Court had the powers to grant prerogative writs including a writ of <i>mandamus</i>. This is provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;25.;;">subsection 25(2) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> in relation to additional powers of the High Court. This provision had been interpreted by the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_705;"><i>Minister Of Finance Government Of Sabah v. Petrojasa Sdn Bhd</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 705</LINK>; [2008] 4 MLJ 641; [2008] 5 CLJ 321 as well as in other cases by the apex court: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1981_1_703;"><i>Zainal Abidin Bin Haji Abdul Rahman v. Century Hotel Sdn Bhd</i> [1981] 1 MLRA 703</LINK>; [1982] 1 MLJ 260 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_71;"><i>R Rama Chandran v. Industrial Court Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 1 MELR 71</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_725;">[1996] 1 MLRA 725</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 145; [1997] 1 CLJ 147; [1997] 1 AMR 433. The gist of these decisions by the apex court is that the civil court may resort to the additional powers given to it under the Schedule to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">Court of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> to found the necessary jurisdiction and to issue appropriate orders in the appropriate case in order to do justice. In the case of <i>The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney</i> [1934] 1 AC 365 at p 395, it was said that the order of <i>mandamus</i> "was introduced to prevent disorder from a failure of justice and defect of police; and that it ought to be used upon all occasions where the law had established no specific remedy, and where in justice and good governance that ought to be one". In <i>Regina v. Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Ex Parte Blackburn</i> [1968] 2 WLR 893, the English Court of Appeal as a matter of principle agreed that a <i>mandamus</i> can be issued to the Commissioner of Police to reverse his policy decision of not prosecuting gaming clubs for breaking gaming laws. Salmon L J, one of the law Lords who delivered the judgment in that case said that "the police owe the public a clear legal duty to enforce the law" and that "in the extremely unlikely event of the police failing or refusing to carry out their duty, the court would not be powerless to intervene".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">Section 20(1) and (3) of the Police Act 1967 ("the Act")</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Act</LINK> empowers and imposes a duty on a police officer to maintain law and order and to apprehend and prosecute offenders. And under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f) of the Act</LINK>, a police officer is under a duty to execute summonses, subpoenas, warrants, commitments and other process lawfully issued by any competent authority. For ease of reference the relevant provisions of the Police Act are reproduce below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Reading the above provisions we have no doubt in our mind that the IGP being the officer in charge of the police and its most superior commander may be directed by a competent authority to carry out the duty impose on a police under his command as envisaged under the Police Act, in particular the above provisions which we have referred to. In law therefore, where there is a legal public duty to do an act by an authority, then an order of <i>mandamus</i> may be issued against that authority to carry out that public duty if such authority has refused to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> However, the appellant in this appeal had mounted a collateral attack against the High Court Orders to justify its claim that the order of <i>mandamus</i> in this case was issued on a wrong exercise of discretion. The appellant argued that the High Court should not have issued the order of <i>mandamus</i> to enforce the High Court Order on custody and recovery of the children because there is a valid Syariah Order granted to Pathmanathan and that by granting the order of <i>mandamus</i> to the respondent, the High Court had placed the IGP in a dilemma. The appellant argued that the Syariah Order and the High Court Order are in conflict with each other. Is that so?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> To resolve the perceived or purported conflict between the Syariah Order and the High Court Orders, we have to take a step back and examine the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court and the civil High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The starting point is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. That article provides that the High Courts (one in Malaya and one Sabah and Sarawak) which were established pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1) of the Constitution</LINK> shall not have jurisdiction in respect of any matter within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. Mr Phillip Koh, who was watching brief for Malaysian Consultative Council for Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism when invited to address the court on the point of jurisdiction as amicus curiae informed the court that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A)</LINK> was introduced into the Constitution to overcome the problem of conflicting decision between the Syariah Court and the High Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRS_1971_1_161;"><i>Myriam lwn. Mohamed Ariff</i> [1971] 1 MLRS 161</LINK>; [1971] 1 MLJ 265. That case also involved custody of children. The husband in that case had obtained by consent from the Kathi Court the custody of the children of their Islamic marriage. Later the wife filed another application for custody of the children in the High Court. The High Court in that case granted the custody to the wife. Both parties in that case were Muslims. So there were two conflicting orders for custody of the children involving two Muslims in Islamic marriage. Thus following the amendment to the Constitution and the insertion of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A)</LINK> the civil High Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with matters that fall within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. In this regard Mr Phillip Koh informed the court that matters that come within the jurisdiction of Syariah are listed in the Ninth Schedule - List II - THE STATE LIST of the Constitution. Among the matters listed are: matters on Islamic law and personal and family law of persons professing the religion of Islam, including the Islamic law relating to succession, testate and intestate, betrothal, marriage, divorce, dower, maintenance, adoption, legitimacy and guardianship. However one must bear in mind that the jurisdiction on these matters conferred on the Syariah Court are only applicable to Muslims. In other words the jurisdiction of the Syariah on these matters does not extend to non-Muslim. This principle has been decided by high authorities and our law reports are replete with cases on point.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We observe in the State list - List II - Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, the matter of custody of children is not expressly stated. One however may argue that matters on marriage, divorce and guardianship mentioned in the List are wide enough to include matters as to custody of children because there are closely linked. We can accept that. But are they exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court? There are provisions in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_351;;">Infant Guardianship Act 1961</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;sectionno.;;">Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act of 1976</LINK> that govern issues as to custody of children out of valid marriage though applicable only to non-Muslim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_173;"><i>Haji Raimi Abdullah v. Siti Hasnah Vangarama Abdullah &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 173</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 757; [2014] 4 CLJ 253, the Federal Court speaking through the judgment of Arifin Zakaria CJ in construing the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the Constitution</LINK> did not disapprove the view expressed by the Court of Appeal in that case that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The Federal Court also quoted with approval the following passage from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_301;"><i>Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja v. Ketua Pengarah Penjara Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 301</LINK>; [1999] 1 MLJ 266; [1999] 1 CLJ 481:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The emphasis is on the phrase "exclusive jurisdiction"; and the Federal Court also did not reject the view by the Court of Appeal that the burden is on the person (who wants the Syariah Court or the High Court to make an order in his or her favour) to satisfy the court that the subject matter of the action is such that it comes exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. In <i>Haji Raimi'</i>s case (<i>supra</i>), the respondent's (the plaintiff) father had converted to Islam together with his wife and five children including the plaintiff who at the time of conversion was an infant in 1983. Sixteen years later in 2009 the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants in the High Court in Penang <i>inter alia</i> for declarations and orders that the defendants had wrongfully and unlawfully subjected the plaintiff to undergo a religious conversion process at the age of seven years old. The defendants in that case filed an application to strike out the plaintiff's action but on appeal to the Court of Appeal by the plaintiff in that case, the appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal directed that the plaintiff's originating summons be converted to writ and the matter be reverted to High Court Penang to be tried on the issue whether the subject matter of the plaintiff's action fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Penang Syariah High Court. The defendant appealed against that decision to the Federal Court and the latter allowed the appeal, ruling that the Syariah Court have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a person is a Muslim or not. That is, the matter is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court as envisaged in the State List - <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">List II - Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Applying the above principle, we are of the view that it is for Pathmanathan (the husband and respondent before the High Court in the custody proceedings filed by the respondent here) to show to the High Court that the issue of custody is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court and that the civil High Court could not and should not make any order on the custody of the children as that would be in conflict with the already existing order obtained by Pathmanathan (the husband and the father) from the Syariah High Court. The High Court that granted the custody order to the respondent apparently did not agree with Pathmanathan. We think the learned judge is correct. In matters of custody involving non-Muslim married couple whose marriage was dissolved on ground of conversion to Islam, the Syariah Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction. At this point we wish to state that from the Islamic point of view if one of the spouse of the marriage embraces Islam the marriage is automatically dissolved. This is because Islam forbids a Muslim to marry a non-Muslim unless the non-Muslim first be converted to Islam except where, if the non Muslim is a woman, the woman is 'ahlil Kitab'. But from the civil marriage point of view, the conversion to Islam does not automatically dissolve the civil marriage registered under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">Law Reform (Marriage And Divorce) Act of 1976</LINK>. The dissolution of the civil marriage may be dissolved only on a petition for divorce in the civil court by the spouse that has not converted to Islam. This position is clear from the reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;51.;;">s 51(1) of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK> which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Thus there is no automatic or immediate dissolution of the civil marriage upon conversion to Islam. It is also pertinent to look at <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;51.;;">s 51(2) of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK> which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In our present case, there is no petition for dissolution of marriage by the respondent on the ground that Pathmanathan had converted to Islam. Therefore, in so far as the respondent is concerned her civil marriage to Pathmanathan is still a valid marriage and still subsists.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In our view, the effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;51.;;">s 51 of the Law Reform (Marriage And Divorce) Act 1976</LINK> is that a non-Muslim wife who has not converted to Islam, may upon the husband's conversion apply to the civil court for custody, care and maintenance of the children even without filing for the dissolution of the civil marriage. That being the case the issue of custody of children of a civil marriage where one party has converted to Islam is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. The non-Muslim party to the civil marriage may file an application in the civil court for the custody of the children and the civil court in appropriate cases may grant the custody order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We therefore conclude that the High Court has jurisdiction to grant the custody order in this case. As authority to support our conclusion on this point we refer to the Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_3_81;"><i>Subashini Rajasingam v. Saravanan Thangathoray &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2007] 3 MLRA 81</LINK>; [2008] 2 MLJ 147; [2008] 2 CLJ 1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> However, in this appeal we are not asked to decide whether the High Court orders were valid or otherwise or that the Syariah Order was null and void. That had been done by the High Court when it granted the order of custody and recovery to the respondent. These issues are raised by the appellant as a side wind to challenge the order of <i>mandamus</i> issued by the High Court. They are raised not for our decision. To put the issues to rest, we need only to cite the Federal Court decision in <i>Subashini Rajasingam (supra)</i> where it was held that the civil High Court has exclusive jurisdiction on the dissolution of civil marriage and matters consequential or ancillary thereto, including maintenance, custody of children and other ancillary matters. They are not within the Syariah Court jurisdiction. Hence, it was held in that case that it was an abuse of process for the husband to file custody proceedings in the Syariah Court in respect of the children because the Syariah Court have no jurisdiction in the matter of custody of children of non-Muslim marriage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The principal question however, is whether the order of <i>mandamus</i> ought to be given in this case. We recapitulate that on 30 May 2014 the learned Justice Lee Swee Seng of the High Court at Ipoh had found the husband Pathmanathan guilty of contempt of the two High Court Orders - the custody and the recovery order and had passed sentence of imprisonment until the contemnor, ie the husband Pathmanathan has purged his contempt. Counsel for Pathmanathan then had applied for the stay of the committal order but was refused. The respondent now can enforce the order with the assistance of the court bailiff to have the contemnor apprehended.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In this respect, the learned senior federal counsel for the appellant submitted that the dispute is between two private parties; and what is involved in the dispute is, a private and personal right of one party over the other. Therefore, we think that public policy militates against the use of public resources, ie the IGP and the police force to enforce the private rights as opposed a public rights when the private rights do not affect the public at large.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The general principle is that an order of <i>mandamus</i> will be issued to enforce a public duty at law for public good generally. Of course here, one may argue that if the order of <i>mandamus</i> is refused, the respondent is without remedy and that the husband Pathmanathan may just ignore the High Court Order with impunity. However we think that even if the order of <i>mandamus</i> is refused the respondent is not without remedy. The committal order is already there; and the respondent could with the assistance of the court bailiff execute the order against the husband.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> An order of <i>mandamus</i> being a discretionary order should not be readily issued when the parties in enforcing a private rights, has a remedy available to it - in this case the committal order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1972_1_497;"><i>Koon Hoi Chow v. Pretam Singh</i> [1972] 1 MLRH 497</LINK>; [1972] 1 MLJ 180, the applicant for a <i>mandamus</i> order was the defendant in a civil suit No 168 of 1971 at Ipoh High Court which is a suit where the plaintiff claim for damages arising from an accident involving an infant. The applicant had applied to the surgeon who was the respondent in the application for detail of injuries found on the infant and the treatment given at the hospital after the request for the information was not comply with by the respondent's surgeon. The respondent in the applicant was the doctor who attended to the infant and had ordered the imputation of the infant's leg above the knee. This application was made pursuant to s 44 of the Specific Relief Ordinance 1950. In the application the applicant alleged that the injuries which the infant actually received were not such that should have necessitated the amputation of the leg provided proper care was exercised by the respondent in charge at the Ipoh Hospital, the inference being that it was the negligence of the respondent which aggravated the injuries. In <i>Koon Hoi Chow (supra)</i>, the learned Sharma J said that "for the applicant to succeed in bringing his case within the purview of s 44 of the Specific Relief Ordinance, the applicant must show a personal rights which would be injured or defeated if the order is not made". In that case the learned counsel for the applicant conceded that the personal rights of the applicant was in truth and substance the right to effectively defend the civil suit. The learned judge held that view that such rights is against the plaintiff in the suit and not against the respondent in the application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It is also pertinent to note that in <i>Koon Hoi Chow (supra)</i> the learned judge also remarked that <i>mandamus</i> does not lie to enforce a civil liability arising out of a contract or to enforce rights based on contract and also that <i>mandamus</i> does not issue to enforce a civil liability under torts. But more importantly the learned judge said that "the applicant must show not only that he has a legal right to have the act performed but that the right is so clear and well defined as to be free from any reasonable controversy. The order cannot issue when the right is doubtful, or is a qualified one or where it depends upon an issue of fact to be determined by the respondent".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In <i>Ex Parte Blackburn (supra)</i> a private citizen had applied to the court for inter alia, an order of <i>mandamus</i> directing the respondent to reverse a policy decision. The policy decision was that the respondent as Commissioner of Police of Metropolis will not allow an insight observation in license or registered club for the purpose of detecting gaming without first obtaining his covering approval. In that case Lord Denning MR said that "<i>mandamus</i> is a very wide remedy which has always been available against public officers to see that they do their public duty". However, the learned law Lord also said that "the parties who apply for <i>mandamus</i> must show that he has sufficient interest to be protected and there is no other equally convenient remedy". Once it is shown the remedy of <i>mandamus</i> is available even against the Commissioner of Police of Metropolis. In his judgment Lord Denning MR had stated that "it is an open question whether Mr Blackburn has a sufficient interest to be protected". His Lordship went further to say that "no doubt any person who was adversely affected by the action of the Commissioner in making a mistaken a policy decision would have such interest". The difficulty is, according to the his lordship is to see how Mr Blackburn himself has been affected. That question was left open and unanswered. But His Lordship went on to hold that "the policy was unfortunate". In our view the facts and circumstances in the <i>Ex Parte Blackburn (supra)</i> are very different from the present appeal. In that case it involved the question of enforcing a law on gaming and it would be in the public interest for the Police Commissioner to put gaming under control according to the provision of the law. But what we want to emphasise is that <i>Ex Parte Blackburn (supra)</i> may be cited as an authority to show that an applicant for an order of <i>mandamus</i> must show sufficient public interest that goes beyond the applicant's personal or private interest. The other law Lord in that case, the learned Edmund Davies LJ said as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this respect, and as we have said earlier, the respondent has the remedy of executing the committal order granted by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> With regard to the approach that the court should take in dealing with an application for <i>mandamus</i>, we can do no better than to quote from a passage by Lord Wright in the House of Lords's case of <i>The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney (supra)</i> at p 395:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We are also of the view that IGP has a discretion in the matter when it comes to execution of process to enforce a personal and private right as oppose to enforcement of public right. In our view the duty and powers imposed on and given to the police under s 20(1) and (3)(f) of the Police Act 1957 must be read in the context of the general duty of the police to maintain law and order and preservation of peace and security of Malaysia and prevention of crimes under s 3(3) of the same Act. These are the public duties of the police. Enforcement of court processes involving private rights does not come within this scope of public duties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> On the above reasoning and in the light of the facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the exercise of discretion by the learned judge ought to be interfered with and the order of <i>mandamus</i> be discharged on the ground of public policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> My learned brother Justice Ahmadi had read this judgment in draft and had agreed with it. But my learned sister Justice Tengku Maimun is dissenting. Accordingly, by majority we allow the appeal. In view of the fact that this is a case of public interest we make no order as to cost.</p>

      <b>[39]</b> This court, by a majority decision had allowed the appeal of the Inspector General of Police (the IGP) against an order of <i>mandamus</i> issued by the High Court. I dissented. I now give the reasons for my dissenting judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The respondent and one Pathmanathan were married under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976 (the Law Reform Act)</LINK>. They have three children.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In 2009, Pathmanathan (the father) converted into Islam. The three children; Tevi Darsiny, Karan Dinish and Prasana Diksa who were 12 years, 11 years and 1 year old respectively were converted by the father as well. The father obtained a custody order for all the three children from the Syariah Court. For obvious reason, that the Syariah Court has no jurisdiction over the non-Muslim respondent (the mother), the mother was not made a party to the proceedings in the Syariah Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In 2010, the mother filed an application in the High Court Ipoh for custody of the three children under the Law Reform Act. The High Court granted the mother the custody of the three children, who at all material time, were with the mother (except the youngest daughter, Prasana Diksa). Prasana Diksa (the child) was barely a year old and was still breast feeding when she was forcibly taken away from the mother in March 2009. The High Court ordered the father to deliver the child to the mother immediately. The father refused to comply with the High Court order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The father had filed an appeal against the custody order but he failed to diligently pursue his appeal, resulting in the appeal being struck out by the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Upon the father's failure to comply with the custody order, the High Court found him to be in contempt and committed him to prison. A warrant of committal, commanding every police officer to apprehend the father and convey him to prison was issued by the High Court. A recovery order under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;;">Child Act 2001</LINK> was also issued by the High Court. The recovery order specifically directed the police to investigate and determine the whereabouts of the father and the child and to obtain custody of the child from any place where she may be found. Insofar as the recovery order is concerned, it must be noted that no affidavit was filed by the father to oppose the mother's application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The father had also appealed against the committal and recovery orders, which appeal had similarly been struck out by the Court of Appeal. Consequent to the striking out of the appeal, the Attorney General's application to intervene on his own behalf and on behalf of the IGP in the proceedings in the Court of Appeal was rendered academic.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The warrant, the order for committal and the recovery order were served on the IGP. The solicitors for the mother had written several letters to the IGP on the orders. The IGP refused to execute the warrant of committal and the recovery order on the ground that the police have been put in a quandary as they are faced with two conflicting court orders, ie the Syariah Court order granting custody to the father and the High Court order granting custody to the mother. The IGP took the position that to execute the custody order of the High Court would cause him to be in contempt of the Syariah Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Unable to trace and be reunited with the child, the mother filed an application in the High Court for judicial review, for a <i>mandamus</i> to be issued to compel the IGP to execute both the warrant of committal and the recovery order. The application was granted by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In challenging the High Court's decision, learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) repeated the stand that the IGP is unable to enforce the committal order and the recovery order because at the same time, the Syariah Court custody order is still in force which entitles the father to custody of the three children including the child.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Learned SFC had also submitted that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> To reiterate, the issue before the Court of Appeal is whether the order of <i>mandamus</i> was correctly granted by the High Court. The correctness of the decision of the High Court on the custody order, the committal order and the recovery order is no longer an issue after the father's appeal was struck out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Coming back to the points raised on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>; on the finding by the High Court that the Syariah Court order was null and void and that the Syariah Court has no jurisdiction to grant the custody order and on the point that the father is also the lawful guardian of the child, the answer is found in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_3_81;"><i>Subashini Rajasingam v. Saravanan Thangathoray &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2007] 3 MLRA 81</LINK>; [2008] 2 MLJ 147; [2008] 2 CLJ 1, where the facts are very much similar to the present case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> In <i>Subashini (supra)</i>, the parties were originally Hindus and were married pursuant to a civil ceremony of marriage registered under the Law Reform Act. There were two children of the marriage, both boys. The husband converted himself and the elder son, aged four at the material time, to Islam. An interim custody order was granted by the Syariah Court in respect of the converted son to the husband. After the husband's conversion and knowing that the husband had taken proceedings in the Syariah Court, the wife filed a petition for the dissolution of marriage pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;51.;;">s 51 of the Law Reform Act</LINK>, coupled with an application for custody and ancillary reliefs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b>
      <i>Subashini'</i>s case went up to the Federal Court. Among the questions posed for determination by the Federal Court was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The Federal Court, speaking through Nik Hashim FCJ said at p 85 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The learned FCJ further said at p 87:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> By the above judgment, it is now settled that the Civil High Court is the court having jurisdiction to deal with the custody of the child born out of a civil marriage. The custody order issued by the High Court is thus a valid order. The committal order and the recovery order which emanate from the custody order are similarly valid orders. The mother has the lawful custody of the child. And this position of the law does not in any way change the position of the Syariah Court and the Civil High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> With regards the third point raised by learned SFC, my views are as follows. Whilst the present case commence as a private dispute in a civil matter, the police is now thrust into the dispute by the application of the law. The involvement of the police does not relate purely to the rights of the father and the mother, but it relates to the administration of justice as a whole.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> One of the general duties of the police as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f) of the Police Act 1967</LINK> is to execute summonses, subpoenas, warrants, commitments and other process lawfully issued by any competent authority. Flowing from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f)</LINK>, it is thus the statutory duty of the police to execute the warrant of committal and the recovery order issued by the High Court. Indeed, it is not the IGP's position that it is not the duty of the police to execute the warrant of committal and the recovery order or that it is the discretion of the police whether or not to execute the said orders. Neither did the IGP assert that the mother had not at any time approached the police for assistance before filing the application for judicial review. The challenge by the IGP is premised on the existence of the Syariah Court order and that the recovery order is beyond the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">s 53 of the Child Act</LINK>, as the father is also considered the lawful guardian.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Parliament in its wisdom had enacted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;52.;;">ss 52</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">53 of the Child Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;52.;;">Section 52(1)</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">Section 53</LINK> provides for recovery order and it states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> The argument that the police ought not to intervene and that the parties should reconcile among themselves, in my view, is not sustainable as it will render the provision in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;53.;;">s 53(3)(d) of the Child Act</LINK> otiose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The law relating to the granting of an order of <i>mandamus</i> is settled. <i>Mandamus</i> lies to secure the performance of a public duty in which an applicant has sufficient legal interest to the performance. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1972_1_497;"><i>Koon Hoi Chow v. Pretam Singh</i> [1972] 1 MLRH 497</LINK>; [1972] 1 MLJ 180 the requirement to be satisfied by the applicant is stated thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> I find that the learned trial judge had not erred in his appreciation of the law or the facts in considering whether <i>mandamus</i> could be issued. In my judgment, the learned judge had properly exercised the remedial jurisdiction in granting <i>mandamus</i> against the IGP. The learned judge had alluded to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;20.;;">s 20(3)(f)</LINK> and to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Police Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;3.;;">Section 3(3)</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Having considered the relevant provisions in the Police Act, His Lordship made reference to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_268;"><i>Syarikat Kenderaan Melayu Kelantan Bhd v. Transport Workers Union</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 268</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 317; [1995] 2 CLJ 748; [1995] 2 AMR 1601 where the Court of Appeal states at p 282:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> The learned judge then made the following finding:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The learned judge further said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> I agree with the above finding of the learned judge. And keeping in mind the Federal Court judgment in <i>Subashini (supra)</i>, I find that there is no appealable error committed by the learned judge that warrants appellate intervention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> It cannot be denied that the mother has a legal right to the child. Her right is not doubtful nor is it a qualified one. The right had been determined by the High Court. The warrant of committal had not been cancelled and the recovery order had not been set aside. The IGP has a clear duty under the law to execute the warrant of committal to apprehend the father (who not only had disobeyed the High Court order but had offended <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;52.;;">s 52 of the Child Act</LINK>) and to give effect to the recovery order. The committal order and the recovery order is the final remedy available to the mother to recover the child. There is no other avenue that the mother could resort to.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> It must be emphasised that quite apart from the fact that the orders issued by the High Court are valid orders, as found by the learned judge, there is no order from the Syariah Court requiring the police to perform any act or duty as opposed to the warrant of committal and recovery issue issued by the High Court which are specifically directed to the police. Based on the above facts, I find that the IGP had taken irrelevant consideration and had acted unreasonably in refusing to execute the said orders.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> In the circumstances of the present case, I am satisfied that <i>mandamus</i> should be granted to enable justice to be done. I therefore dismiss the appeal with no order as to costs.</p>
