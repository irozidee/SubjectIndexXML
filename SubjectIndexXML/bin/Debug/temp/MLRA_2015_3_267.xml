    <p>The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant company was the original proprietor of a piece of land and developer of a condominium project on the land known as Palm Spring Condominium ('condominium'). On 8 January 2008, the 1<sup>nd</sup> appellant was established as the management corporation for the condominium under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;;">Strata Titles Act 1985 ('Act 318')</LINK>. Then on 5 April 2008, the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent was established as the Joint Management Body. A dispute arose between the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant and the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent and the events that followed led to both parties calling for separate general meetings respectively. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent authority sought to validate the meeting called by the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent and the appointment of members of its council. The appellants as plaintiffs then brought an action against the respondents, <i>inter alia</i>, to: (i) validate the general meeting called by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant and invalidate the general meeting called by the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent; (ii) invalidate the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent on the grounds that it contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;4.;;">subsection 4(1)(a) of the Building and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act 2007 ('Act 663')</LINK>; and (iii) declare the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's attempt to validate the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent's meeting as ultra vires. The High Court dismissed the appellants' action on the ground that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was estopped from invalidating the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent as the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent had come into being pursuant to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's own act in calling for the meeting to establish the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent. The learned judge also found that <i>res judicata</i> operated against the appellants as the substance of the present action was substantially the same as the subject matter of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's application for leave for judicial review in another High Court proceeding which was refused. Hence the appellants now appealed on the following grounds: (1) whether the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent was lawfully constituted; and (2) whether res judicata and estoppel operated so as to bar the appellants from challenging the validity of the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent's establishment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was no evidence as to the date the condominium project was completed and vacant possession of the parcels delivered to the purchasers by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. That fact if known would have greatly assisted the court within the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;4.;;">subsection 4(1) of Act 663</LINK>. What was not in dispute was that the Director of Lands and Mines of Selangor had issued a certificate dated 8 January 2008 under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">subsection 39(2A) of Act 318</LINK>. The Director, presumably in his capacity as the Registrar of Titles, signed it on 7 April 2009. Therefore, the certificate certifying the fact of the incorporation of the management corporation for the condominium was issued some 15 months after the actual date the management corporation came into existence by operation of law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">s 39 of Act 318</LINK>. The problem that arose in this case was that while a management corporation had come into existence by operation of law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">s 39 of Act 318</LINK> on 8 January 2008, a meeting was held and a Joint Management Body was established on 5 April 2008, some three months later, under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK>. (paras 23-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;41.;;">Section 41 of Act 318</LINK> required the developer to convene the first general meeting of the management corporation within one month of the expiry of the initial period. The initial period was defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;4.;;">s 4 of Act 318</LINK> as the period commencing on the day on which the management corporation was formed and ending on the day on which there were proprietors, excluding the proprietor of the lot who was registered as the proprietor of a parcel or parcels or a provisional block or blocks, the sum of whose share units was at least onethird of the aggregate share units. There did not appear to be express provisions as to who was to perform the functions of a management corporation pending the election of its council at the first general meeting. However, the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;40.;;">s 40 of Act 318</LINK> implied that during the initial period before such election it was the original proprietor that had the duty of performing the functions of the management corporation. (paras 32-33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b>
      <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK> was meant to put in place a legislative scheme to ensure the proper management and maintenance of a strata development pending the opening of a book of strata register and the coming into being of a management corporation. Once a management corporation came into existence, not only could there be no Joint Management Body formed, an existing Joint Management Body was also automatically dissolved under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;15.;;">s 15 of Act 663</LINK>. (paras 37-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In view of the legislative scheme as contained in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;;">Act 318</LINK>, in particular the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;15.;;">ss 15</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;17.;;">17</LINK>, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">ss 39</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;49.;;">49 of Act 318</LINK>, and as contained in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK>, in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;15.;;">s 15 of Act 663</LINK>, the argument that a Joint Management Body could be legally established under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK> once a management corporation had come into existence under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;;">Act 318</LINK> could not be sustained. Therefore, the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent was unlawfully constituted and its establishment was null and void <i>ab initio</i>. (paras 40-41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> No order, be it an order made after full trial, in an interlocutory proceeding, a consent order or an order made in dismissing an application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings, operate to preclude a challenge to an order or a decision on the grounds of illegality or unlawfulness or as being contrary to law or statute. The fact that the parties agreed to a consent order or that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's application for leave for judicial review was dismissed could not bar the appellants from challenging the validity of the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent's establishment even though the substance of the subject matter of those actions was similar to this action. Similarly, the act of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant in facilitating the establishment of the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent in April 2008 could not estop the appellants from challenging the validity of the establishment of the 1<sup>nd</sup> respondent, especially in view of the fact that at that point in time the certificate certifying the establishment of the management corporation had not yet been issued by the Registrar.

      <b>Zaharah Ibrahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> For ease of reference, the parties to this appeal will be referred to in this judgment as they were in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff developed a housing project known later as Palm Spring Condominium @ Damansara [the condominium]. It was the original proprietor of that lot of land on which the condominium was developed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 8 January 2008, by virtue of the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;;">Strata Titles Act 1985 [Act 318]</LINK>, the 1<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff came into legal existence as the management corporation for the condominium.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 5 April 2008, the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant was established.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The first general meeting of the 1<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was called by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff as the original proprietor of the condominium, to be held on 4 September 2011. The 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant's application to the High Court for an injunction to restrain the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff from holding that general meeting was dismissed by the High Court on 2 September 2011. However, due to lack of quorum, that general meeting was adjourned to 11 September 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 11 September 2011 no general meeting was held by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff who claimed that it was not possible nor safe to proceed with the general meeting due to the disturbance caused by the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> However, the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant claimed that the adjourned general meeting was duly held on 11 September 2011 and that a council was appointed on that date during that general meeting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 15 October 2011 the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff held a general meeting at a different location and a copy of the minutes of the meeting was sent to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The dispute between the two factions led to a meeting convened by the Federal Director General of Lands and Mines on 8 November 2011 and that meeting resolved that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was to direct the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to produce the audited accounts of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff from 2008 until the current period, failing which the general meeting held on 11 September 2011 would be held to be valid and the appointment of members of the council on that date would also be held to be valid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff however claimed that it could not produce the required audited accounts in view of the fact that by Suit No: S5-22-868-2006, the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant had at first obtained an <i>ex parte</i> injunction on 28 August 2008 and a permanent injunction on 28 June 2010 against the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and had excluded the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff from the management of the condominium and had in fact commenced committal proceedings against the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff for its failure to comply with the terms of the injunction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Suit</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was against that backdrop of facts that the plaintiffs commenced this suit claiming the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant, claiming that it was lawfully constituted, and pleading <i>res judicata</i> and estoppel, counterclaimed for the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The suit was heard in a full trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In the learned High Court Judge's 58-page grounds of judgment the facts of the dispute between the parties were set out in great detail, particularly those relating to the general meetings of 11 September 2011 and 15 October 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Her Ladyship held, <i>inter alia</i>, that as the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant came into existence on 5 April 2008 (or on 4 April 2008 as stated in the Grounds of Judgment) pursuant to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff 's own act in calling the meeting for the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant's establishment, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was estopped from claiming that the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant's existence was illegal/unlawful.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Her Ladyship also held that estoppel must also operate against the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff as it had entered into a consent judgment on 28 June 2010 in Suit No: S5-22-868-2008 whereby the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had agreed not to prevent the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant from managing the condominium. It had also agreed to surrender all relevant items and documents to enable the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant to perform such management role.</p>
    <p>[17] Apart from estoppel, the learned High Court Judge also found that <i>res judicata</i> operated against the plaintiffs as the substance of the present suit was substantially the same as the subject-matter of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff 's application for leave for judicial review in Shah Alam High Court in Suit No: MT2-13-2008. Her Ladyship held that as leave was refused, the learned judge hearing the application must have held that the application was frivolous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned High Court Judge then dismissed the plaintiffs' claim and allowed the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant's counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> That part of the High Court Order dated 14 December 2012 allowing the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant's counterclaim was in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The plaintiffs appealed to this court against that order of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> However, when the parties appeared before us on 22 July 2013, the counsel for the plaintiffs conceded paras (a) and (b) of the order of the High Court. We therefore heard submissions only on the legitimacy of the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant and the orders made in its favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issues During Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The issues before us were therefore:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Analysis Of Issues</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(1) Whether The 1<sup>nd</sup> Defendant Was Lawfully Constituted?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> After perusing the record of appeal, we were unable to find any evidence as to the date the condominium was completed and vacant possession of the parcels delivered to the purchasers by the developer. This fact if known would have greatly assisted us within the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;4.;;">subsection 4(1) of Act 663</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> What was NOT in dispute was that a certificate dated 8 January 2008 was issued by the Director of Lands and Mines of Selangor under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">subsection 39(2A) of Act 318</LINK>. The Director, presumably in his capacity as the Registrar of Titles, signed it on 7 April 2009. In other words the certificate certifying the fact of the incorporation of the management corporation for the condominium was issued some 15 months after the actual date of that management corporation coming into existence by operation of law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">s 39 of Act 318</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The problem that arose in this case was that while a management corporation had come into existence by operation of law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">s 39 of Act 318</LINK> on 8 January 2008, a meeting was held and a Joint Management Body was established on 5 April 2008, some three months later, under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[26]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;15.;;">s 15 of Act 318</LINK>, upon application being made by the proprietor of the lot on which a subdivided building had been built and upon the specified conditions having been complied with, a strata register will be opened by the Registrar of Titles and that register (consisting of a series of books, each relating to one lot) will contain, among others:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Form 2 will contain the name of the management corporation that will come into being upon the opening of the strata register. That name must be supplied by the proprietor of the lot as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;15.;;">subsection 15(2) of Act 318</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;17.;;">s 17 of Act 318</LINK>, when a book of strata register is opened, the strata register and the document of title to the lot will have a memorial entered by the Registrar of Titles stating that such book has been opened.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">s 39 of Act 318</LINK>, the management corporation with the name as stated in the strata register comes into existence upon the opening of the book of strata register. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">Section 39</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The memorial under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;17.;;">s 17</LINK> will also contain a statement to the effect that the common property of the strata development is vested in the management corporation.</p>

      <b>[33]</b> There do not appear to be express provisions as to who is to perform the functions of a management corporation pending the election of its council at the first general meeting. However, the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;40.;;">s 40 of Act 318</LINK> imply that during the initial period before such election it is the original proprietor which has the duty of performing the functions of the management corporation.</p>
    <p>[34] <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;40.;;">Section 40 of Act 318</LINK> provides as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;41A.;;">s 41A of Act 318</LINK>, where the first annual general meeting of a management corporation has not been held, the proprietors of the parcels and provisional blocks must, nonetheless, pay sums of money to the management corporation as contributions. The amount to be paid is the amount approved by the State Director of Lands and Mines.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;43.;;">Sections 43</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;49.;;">49 (both sections inclusive) of Act 318</LINK> set out the powers and duties of the management corporation. A comparison of these provisions and those which provide for the powers and duties of the Joint Management Body under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK> will show that the management corporation has similar and wider powers and duties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b>
      <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK> is meant to put in place a legislative scheme to ensure the proper management and maintenance of a strata development pending the opening of a book of strata register and the coming into being of a management corporation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The Minister for Housing and Local Government in tabling the Bill for second reading in the Dewan Rakyat on 12 December 2006 made this clear in his speech:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Once a management corporation comes into existence, not only can there be no Joint Management Body formed, an existing Joint Management Body is also automatically dissolved under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;15.;;">s 15 of Act 663</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In view of the legislative scheme as contained in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;;">Act 318</LINK>, in particular the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;15.;;">ss 15</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;17.;;">17</LINK>, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;39.;;">ss 39</LINK> until <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;49.;;">49 of Act 318</LINK>, and as contained in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK>, in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;15.;;">s 15 of Act 663</LINK>, the argument that a Joint Management Body can be legally established under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_663;;">Act 663</LINK> once a management corporation has come into existence under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1985_318;;">Act 318</LINK> cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We were therefore of the considered view that the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant was unlawfully constituted and that its establishment was null and void <i>ab initio</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2) Whether Res Judicata And Estoppel Operated Against The Plaintiffs?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant relied upon the Supreme Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_611;"><i>Asia Commercial Finance (M) Berhad v. Kawal Teliti Sdn Bhd</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 611</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 189; [1995] 3 CLJ 783; [1995] 3 AMR 2559 in defending the learned High Court Judge's finding that <i>res judicata</i> operated against the plaintiffs. Indeed, the very same decision was relied upon by the learned High Court Judge in her judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In our view, no order, be it an order made after full trial, or in an interlocutory proceeding, or a consent order or an order made in dismissing an application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings, could operate so as to preclude a challenge to an order or a decision on the grounds of illegality or unlawfulness or as being contrary to law/statute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We were of the considered view, relying, among others, upon the Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909, that the fact that the parties agreed to a consent order in Suit No: S5-22-868-2008 or that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff 's application for leave for judicial review in Shah Alam High Court Suit No: MT2-13-2008 was dismissed (and the appeal against that decision was withdrawn) could not bar the plaintiffs from challenging the unlawfulness of the establishment of the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant even though the substance of the subject matter of the two suits was similar to this suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Similarly, the act of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in facilitating the establishment of the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant in April 2008 could not, in our view, operate so as to estop the plaintiffs from challenging the unlawfulness of the establishment of the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant, especially in view of the fact that at that point in time the certificate certifying the establishment of the management corporation had not yet been issued by the Registrar. It was issued 12 months later.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We accordingly allowed the appeal by the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In view of the plaintiffs' concession with respect to paras (a) and (b) of the High Court Order and our conclusion that the establishment of the 1<sup>nd</sup> defendant was void <i>ab initio</i>, we varied the High Court order as follows:</p>
