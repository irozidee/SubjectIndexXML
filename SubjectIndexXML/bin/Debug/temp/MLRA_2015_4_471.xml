    <p>There were four appeals before the court that stemmed from a dispute between the parties herein who were shareholders of a company called Magic Telecom Sdn Bhd ('Magic Telecom'). Magic Telecom was the subsidiary company of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent company in these appeals, ie Numix Engineering Sdn Bhd. The 2nd and 3rd respondents were the shareholders and Directors of the 1st respondent company. The two appellants in these appeals became shareholders of Magic Telecom by investing and granting a loan to Magic Telecom respectively. Briefly, one of the two appellants, Looh Siong Chee ('LSC'), invested in Magic Telecom when it was in need of financial assistance. The subsequent events showed that LSC persuaded the respondents to issue four million new ordinary shares of Magic Telecom as temporary collateral of the other appellant company, ie Sejahtera Saluran Sdn Bhd ("Sejahtera"), granting a loan of RM4 million to Magic Telecom which was in need of funds at the material time. The temporary collateral was to be redeemed later by LSC. When that did not materialise, Sejahtera, by virtue of its four million shares of Magic Telecom, requisitioned an EGM to include additional Directors to the board of Directors of Magic Telecom, which the respondents strongly objected to. The 1st respondent company successfully obtained an injunction to declare the EGM null and void, and a petition was filed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 Companies Act 1965 ('CA')</LINK> against the appellants primarily to declare Sejahtera's shares of Magic Telecom null and void. The appellants in turn filed a civil suit against the respondents for breach of a shareholders agreement, amongst others. The petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK> and the civil suit, which were the subject matter of these appeals, were heard together in the High Court. The learned judge found in favour of the respondents and the Court of Appeal concurred with the findings of the learned judge. The question posed in these appeals was whether the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK> as expounded by the Privy Council in <i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd; Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Ling Beng Sung</i> should be reconsidered in the light of recent developments in England on the law of oppression, namely, the passage of s 994 Companies Act 2006 read with <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> and <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons Plc</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeals with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Federal Court in <i>Pan-Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor</i> had appropriately dealt with the development in English law in relation to the law of oppression. In that case, the Federal Court also observed that s 994 Companies Act 2006, although similar to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK>, was not in <i>pari materia</i> with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK>. Since "oppression" was created by statute, it would only be fair to compare an apple with an apple and not with an orange. Further, <i>Pan Pacific Construction (supra)</i> did make references and followed the English case of <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i>. In the latest Federal Court case of <i>Jet-Tech Materials Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Yushiro Chemical Industry Co Ltd &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i>, it was rightly held that the question of whether it was "just and equitable "to wind up a company was a question of fact. (paras 26-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> From the judgments of the courts below, the core issue relating to the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK> was factual-centric in nature. The courts below had made concurrent findings of fact based on the evidence adduced and produced at the joint-trial. Based on the evidence (both oral and documentary) and the circumstances of the case, there was no reason to interfere with the said concurrent findings. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Since the question posed to this court was whether the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK> should be reconsidered, the answer lay in the position of the law and the application of the facts of the case to the law. On the facts of the present case, there was nothing in them to justify a choice of principle between the English cases cited in the question and that in <i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd; Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Ling Beng Sung</i>. They were succinctly considered in <i>Jet-Tech Materials Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Yushiro Chemical Industry Co Ltd &amp; Ors and Another Appeal</i> and <i>Pan-Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor</i>. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The answer to the question posed was in the negative. There was no valid reason, either in law or on the facts, to reconsider the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK>. In <i>Pan Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor</i>, the Federal Court had specifically accepted the proposition by Lord Hoffman in <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> and <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons Plc</i> that the concept of fairness should be applied judicially and that fairness would mean "commercial fairness", which was endorsed by the later case of <i>Jet-Tech Materials Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Yushiro Chemical Industry Co Ltd &amp; Ors and Another Appeal</i>. It followed therefore that the applicable test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 CA</LINK> was the principle laid down in <i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd; Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Ling Beng Sung</i> and the basis to determine fairness was that of "commercial fairness" as explained in <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> and <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons Plc</i>. This court had been consistent on that matter and there was no incompatibility between the tests in Re Kong Thai Sawmill and the English cases cited in the leave question. As such, there was no question on the need to "reconsider" the <i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill</i> test in the light of the decisions in <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> and <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons Plc</i> because both had already been adequately considered by this court earlier. (paras 33-35)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Mohamed Apandi Ali FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> There are four appeals by the appellants against the decision of the Court of Appeal that had affirmed the decision of the High Court. The core issue that became the subject-matter of the appeals was the decision that granted an oppression petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the Companies Act 1965</LINK> against the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Leave To Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, leave to appeal was granted on 15 October 2012, on a single question, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The history of the protracted litigation between the parties started when the respondents presented an oppression petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">Companies Act 1965</LINK>, on 8 October 2010 against one Magic Telecom Sdn Bhd and the appellants vide Petition No: D-26NCVC-100-2010. Consequential to that on 30 December 2010 the appellants filed a civil suit against the respondents vide Civil Suit No: 5-NCVC-100-2010. By consent, parties agreed for the oppression petition and the civil suit to be tried together at the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Magic Telecom Sdn Bhd was the subsidiary company of the 1st respondent (Numix Engineering Sdn Bhd) and the 2nd respondent (Abdul Razak bin Mohd Noor) and the 3rd respondent (Aishah binti Harun) were shareholders and Directors of Numix Engineering Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Numix Engineering Sdn Bhd ("Numix") was a vehicle used by Abdul Razak bin Mohd Noor ("Razak") and Aishah binti Harun ("Aishah") to operate an existing telecommunications business referred to as the VSAT Ku Band business, in partnership with Telekom Malaysia since 2008. Numix was a holder of various telecommunication licences known as 'ASP', 'NSP' and 'NFP' licences, since September 2009 and had applied for another licence known as the "Spectrum Approval for 800 MHz" on 15 October 2009. The appellant, Looh Siong Chee ("LSC") came into the picture when Numix was in need of financial assistance. LSC then invested in Magic Telecom Sdn Bhd ("Magic") and on 28 October 2009 the one million shares in Magic were allotted in the following proportions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In January 2010, LSC entered into the following agreements:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Based upon the above-said agreements, the respective obligations of the parties are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In view of the date line involved in securing the Spectrum Approval of 800 MHz and the procurement of the additional investment, the trouble began. By April 2010 LSC failed to secure the Spectrum Approval and by end of July 2010 Magic was in the red and in need of funds. To resolve the situation LSC persuaded Razak and Aishah to issue four million new ordinary shares of Magic as temporary collateral of Sejahtera Saluran Sdn Bhd ("Sejahtera") granting a loan of RM4 million to Magic. The temporary collateral was to be redeemed by LSC within fourteen days from LSC's capital injection of RM15 million, which was supposed to be injected into Magic on or before 30 July 2010. However on or about 17 August 2010, Sejahtera's company Secretary wrote to the respondents informing them that Sejahtera, by using the four million shares allotted to them, was requisitioning an EGM on 8 December 2010 to include two additional Directors on Magic's Board of Directors. This was strongly objected to by the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As a result, Numix was compelled to file an Originating Summon No: D24-NCC-429-2010 against Sejahtera, LSC and three others to stop the EGM which Sejahtera had proceeded to convene despite the respondents' objections. The High Court granted, <i>inter alia</i>, an injunction as prayed in favour of Numix declaring the meeting null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On or about 8 October 2010, the respondents, as petitioners, filed a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> suit against LSC, Sejahtera and Magic (as a nominal defendant) claiming <i>inter alia</i>, the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On or about 17 December 2010, LSC and Sejahtera filed a Civil Suit No: S-22NCVC-211-2010 against the respondents seeking, inter alia, the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Both the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> Petition and the Civil Suit were heard together by Justice Anantham Kasinather between 21 and 24 of January 2011. On 11 April 2011 the learned judge pronounced judgment in favour of the respondents on the allotment of four million shares to be null and void and, accordingly, rectification of the share register. Magic was ordered to be wound up.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Meanwhile, Jet Allied filed Civil Suit No: S-22NCVC-169-2010 against Numix and Magic (strangely enough not against LSC) seeking to declare the SA valid and calling upon Numix and/or Magic to compensate the company for damages for breach of contract because of Numix filing the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> petition. The said civil suit was withdrawn with no order to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Finding By The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The learned trial judge in dealing with the oppression petition made a preliminary finding of fact that the four million ordinary shares issued to Sejahtera were by way of collateral; and such finding was based on the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned trial judge also analysed the prejudicial effect to the respondents of the said allotment of the four million ordinary shares to Sejahtera. In his judgment, the learned trial judge wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned trial judge then made a finding that there was, on the facts, sufficient evidence of oppression under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;"> s 181(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1965</LINK> and concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned trial judge also concluded that the best solution, in the circumstances, was the winding up of Magic, whereby he wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Finding By The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Court of Appeal made a concurrent finding of fact on the status of the RM4 million ordinary shares allocated to Sejahtera. This can be seen in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which, <i>inter alia</i> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Court of Appeal also made various findings of fact and concluded in the same vein as the High Court. In its judgment, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions By Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> From the single leave question posed in the appeals the appellants asked for this court to reconsider the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the Companies Act 1965</LINK> as expounded in the Privy Council case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_235;"><i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd; Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Ling Beng Sung</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 235;</LINK> [1978] 2 MLJ 227.  It was submitted that such test has to be so reconsidered in the light of the new s 994 of the English Companies Act 2006 and to be read with the English case laws of <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> [1999] 2 BCLC 1 and <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons Plc</i> [1995] 1 BCLC 14.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It was submitted by the appellants that the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> should be further explained on two aspects, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It was argued by the appellants and relying on the recent Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_345;"><i>Jet-Tech Materials Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Yushiro Chemical Industry Co Ltd &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 345</LINK>; [2013] 2 MLJ 297 [2013] 2 CLJ 277, that breaches of a shareholders' agreement could not be a basis for a petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK>. Alternatively it was argued that any breach of the SHA or undertaking under the MOU could only give rise to a private right by Numix against LSC for recission and/or damages, but not a drastic remedy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> that will affect other investors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The respondents submitted that the thrust of the appellants' argument was not related to the leave question but rather more on the findings of fact by the courts below. On the cross-reference to the <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i>'s case, it was argued that it has been adopted by our courts, in particular in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_761;"><i>Pan-Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 761 </LINK>; [2010] 6 CLJ 721. In short, the respondents submitted that there was no novel question of law to be decided and urged this court to dismiss the appeals by not answering the leave question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Analysis &amp; Decision Of The Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> From the leave question posed before us, it is clear that it is a request for this court to reconsider the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the Companies Act 1965</LINK><i>vis-a-vis</i> the developments in England, in particular the decisions in <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others and Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons Plc</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Before we deal with the leave question it is only appropriate, at the outset to see what <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> provides, in terms of its scope and application. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">Section 181</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> On the novelty of the question posed that may give rise to the necessity to reconsider the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK>, it is our considered view that the so-called new development in English law has been appropriately dealt with by this court in <i>Pan-Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor</i>. This can be seen in the said judgment <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_761;"><i>Pan-Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 761 </LINK> at pp 767-769; [2010] 6 CLJ 721, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It is pertinent to note that the Federal Court also made an observation that s 994 of the UK Companies Act 2006, although similar to, not in <i>pari materia</i> with our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK>. And since what is an oppression is created by statute, it would only be fair to compare an apple with another apple and not with an orange.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Richard Malanjum CJSS, who wrote the judgment in Pan-Pacific Construction, did make references and in fact followed the English case of <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i>, when he wrote as follows:</p>

      <b>[29] </b>Next, there is the latest Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_345;"><i>Jet-Tech Materials Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Yushiro Chemical Industry Co Ltd &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 345</LINK>; [2013] 2 MLJ 297 [2013] 2 CLJ 277, where in the judgment delivered by Raus Sharif PCA, <i>inter alia</i> (from pp 359-362) it was held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Based on the case cited above, it could be said that s 210 of the UK Companies Act 1948 is totally different from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the Malaysian CA</LINK>. Section 210 of the UK Companies Act laid down the requisite "just and equitable" being the condition that has to be fulfilled before a company could be wound up unlike <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the Malaysian CA</LINK> where the words "just and equitable" does not appear. Therefore, at this stage we are of the opinion that the case of Ebrahimi does not allow Malaysian Court to import the concept of "just and equitable" under s 210 of the UK Companies Act 1948 as a ground for winding up under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the Malaysian CA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> However, it must be stressed that Ebrahimi was decided under the UK Companies Act 1948, a statute that was repealed by the UK Companies Act 1985. An action for oppression of the minority shareholders has now been provided for under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 and the remedy spelt out in s 461 as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The English Courts had an opportunity to examine s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 in the case of <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> [1999] 2 All ER 961 ("<i>O'Neill</i>"). The House of Lords in O'Neill stressed that there must be some breach of equitable principle or an agreement before a breach of a member's legitimate expectation may give rise to a remedy for oppression. The House of Lords had also imported the "just and equitable" principles as enunciated in Ebrahimi into the oppression provision of the UK Companies Act 1985. Lord Hoffman in the course of discussing the phrase "unfairly prejudicial" found in s 461 of the UK Companies Act 1985 concluded that the concept of unfairness in s 459 was parallel to the concept of "just and equitable" as propounded in Ebrahimi. Lord Hoffman said:</p>

      <b>[31]</b> The scope of the oppression petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the CA</LINK> was recently discussed by this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_761;">Pan-Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor [2010] 1 MLRA 761 </LINK>; [2010] 6 CLJ 721, where Richard Malanjum CJ (Sabah &amp; Sarawak) held that:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Applying what was stated by Lord Hoffman in <i>O'Neill</i> and this court in <i>Pan-Pacific Construction Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Ngiu-Kee Corporation (M) Bhd &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, we hold the view that the principle laid down by Ebrahimi may be applied to the oppression provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the CA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> However the question of whether or not it is "just and equitable" to wind up a company is a question of fact. In the instant case, it was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the learned trial judge had made a finding of fact on the issue of oppression, and had exercised his discretion correctly and judicially. The Court of Appeal thus was wrong in reversing the findings of fact of the learned trial judge. In all fairness to the judges of the Court of Appeal, they were clearly aware of the limits of their power to interfere with the findings of fact of a trial judge."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As rightly held by this court in <i>Jet-Tech Materials (supra)</i> the question of whether it is "just and equitable" to wind up a company is a question of fact.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In the appeals before us, from the judgments of the courts below, part of which have been quoted in the earlier parts of this judgment, it is clear that the core issue relating to the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> is factual-centric in nature. The courts below have made concurrent findings of facts based on the evidence adduced and produced at the joint-trial. Based on the evidence (both oral and documentary) and the circumstances of the case, we see no reason to interfere with the said concurrent findings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Since the question posed to this court is to whether the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> should be reconsidered, the answer lies in the position of the law and the application of the facts of the case to the law. On the facts of the case, we find that there is nothing in them to justify a choice of principle between the English cases cited in the question and that in Re Kong Thai Sawmill. All has been succinctly considered by this court in <i>Jet-Tech Materials and Pan-Pacific Construction</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33] </b>For the above reasons, we have no choice, but to answer the question posed in the negative. There is no valid reason, either in law or on the facts, for this court to reconsider the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181 of the Companies Act</LINK>. To recapitulate: In <i>Pan-Pacific Construction</i>, this court had specifically accepted the proposition by Lord Hoffman in <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> and <i>Re Saul D Harrison &amp; Sons Plc</i> that the concept of fairness should be applied judicially and that fairness would mean "commercial fairness". This was endorsed by the later case <i>Jet-Tech Materials</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> From the above decisions of this court, it is now trite law that the applicable test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;181.;;">s 181</LINK> is the principle as laid down in Re Kong Thai Sawmill and that the basis to determine fairness was that of "commercial fairness" as explained in <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips and Others</i> and <i>Re Saul D Harrison</i>. This court has been consistent on this matter and there is no incompatibility between the tests in Re Kong Thai Sawmill and the English cases cited in the leave question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In view of the above, we find that there is no question on the need to "reconsider" the <i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill</i> test in the light of the decisions in <i>O'Neill and Another v. Phillips</i> and Others and <i>Re Saul D Harrison</i> because both have already been adequately considered by this court earlier, as explained above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> As such, we hereby dismiss the appeals with costs.</p>
