    <p>The plaintiffs sued the defendants herein - members of the Elections Commission - alleging conspiracy and fraud in relation to the use of indelible ink in the 13th General Elections ("GE13"). The plaintiffs, comprising political parties and several GE13 unsuccessful candidates in the loose political coalition named Pakatan Rakyat, claimed that the indelible ink which was intended to prevent multiple voting by dishonest voters, had failed thereby rendering the election results null and void. The plaintiffs had lost approximately 43 seats in GE13 with narrow margins of less than 10 votes. The plaintiffs' claim was essentially a complaint against the manner in which the defendants had conducted GE13, the chief complaint being the failure of the indelible ink. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs' action was "frivolous and vexatious" or "an abuse of the process of court" and ought to be struck out pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;19.;;">O 18 r 19(1)(b) or (d) of the Rules of Court 2012 ("ROC")</LINK>. The defendants alleged that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of the Federal Constitution ("FC")</LINK> was the only method to challenge election results and that by way of Election Petition and not by moving the High Court under its original civil jurisdiction. Further, the High Court had no power and jurisdiction to make an order removing the defendants from office as art <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;114.;;">114(3) of the FC</LINK> provided that members of the Elections Commission could only be removed on the like grounds and in the same manner as a judge of the Federal Court. The High Court judge found that the plaintiffs' claim was obviously unsustainable and the judge ordered the claim to be struck out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;19.;;">O 18 r 19(1)(b) or (d) of the ROC</LINK>. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal by a majority</p>
    <p>Per Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA (majority):</p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> It was unequivocally clear from the language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of the FC</LINK>, that in Malaysia an election could only be questioned by an Election Judge trying an election petition. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">Article 118</LINK> is couched in imperative and absolute terms and its effect excludes the High Court from exercising any jurisdiction over all matters that called into question an election whether in the House of Representatives or State Assembly. Based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;32.;;">s 32</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;33.;;">s 33(1) of the Elections Offences Act 1954</LINK>, an election petition is to be tried by an Election Judge, which under the said Act is defined as a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Judge to try an election petition. (paras 41-43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The plaintiffs, vide their civil suit were in effect calling into question or rather challenging the results of GE13. The plaintiffs' claim fell squarely within the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> and as such could only be brought by an election petition to be heard by an Election Judge and not by way of a civil suit to be adjudicated upon by a judge in the exercise of his or her ordinary civil jurisdiction. The mere pleading of the causes of action could not confer jurisdiction on the High Court. Any such attempt would violate <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK>. (paras 47-48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The High Court judge had not erred in holding that the principle in <i>R Rama Chandran</i> did not apply in the instant case. The Federal Court when enunciating the principle was dealing with a case where the High Court was exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;25.;;">s 25</LINK> read together with para 1 of the Schedule to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. The Federal Court held that the High Court in <i>certiorari</i>proceedings not only had the power to quash the impugned decision but could mould the relief in accordance with the exigencies of the situation in order to satisfy the demands of justice. In the instant case, there was no question of the court exercising its power to mould the relief as the court did not in the first place have the jurisdiction to hear the matter. (paras 67-69)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It is clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;114.;;">art 114(3)</LINK> of the FC that the High Court does not hasve the jurisdiction to remove members of the Elections Commission from their office. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;114.;;">Article 114(3)</LINK> provides that members of the Elections Commission can only be removed from office on the like grounds and manner as that of a judge of a Federal Court. The High Court does not have any jurisdiction to make an order for the removal of the defendants from their office. (paras 70, 71 &amp; 73)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The High Court judge was correct in holding that the High Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' suit and it ought to be struck out for being vexatious, frivolous and an abuse of the process of court. (para 76)</p>
    <p>Per Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA (dissenting):</p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was an application to strike out the plaintiffs' claim and the duty of the Court was to save the pleadings by amendment rather than by striking out. Prayer (1) in the plaintiffs' statement of claim could stand on its own, seeking a declaratory order without any consequential relief. All the plaintiffs would obtain was a declaration on whether the defendants were in breach of their constitutional duties in the conduct of the elections. While it was open to challenge the defendants on such basis, where an election result was to be avoided, one must proceed through an Election Petition. <i>Muniandy Subrayan &amp; Ors v. Chairman And Board Members, Koperasi Menara Maju Bhd (refd)</i>. (para 81)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The FC, being the Supreme Law of the Federation imposes a constitutional duty on the respondents to conduct Elections in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;113.;;">art 113(i)</LINK> of the same. It was open for the plaintiffs to raise by way of a declaration whether the defendants had breached their constitutional duty to conduct the General Elections of 2013 with fairness. At any rate this was an important issue that should not be summarily disposed of. (paras 82-83)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Seeking a declaration of rights without consequential relief should be encouraged since the law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;41.;;">s 41 of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> allows the same. <i>Pengarah Tanah Dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellants (the plaintiffs) against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who had struck out the plaintiffs' writ and statement of claim pursuant to an application by the respondents (the defendants) under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;19.;;">O 18 r 19(1)(b) and (b) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The plaintiffs herein brought this action against the Elections Commission (the defendants herein who are sued as members of the Elections Commission) alleging conspiracy and fraud in relation to the use of indelible ink in the 13th General Elections (GE13).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It is an undisputed fact that the GE13 which was held on 5 May 2013 saw the ruling party (the Barisan Nasional) returned to power with a majority of 133 seats out of a total of 222 seats in Parliament.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The opposition, a loosely formed coalition known as Pakatan Rakyat, comprising the Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), the Democratic Action Party (DAP) and the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) lost approximately 43 seats in the GE13 with allegedly relatively narrow margins of less than 10 votes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The plaintiffs alleged that the failure of the indelible ink which was intended to prevent multiple voting by dishonest voters was caused solely by the defendants' breach of their constitutional duty to properly conduct the GE13. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants have practiced fraud on the electorate by the misuse of the indelible ink.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The plaintiffs contended that the failure of the indelible ink rendered the election results null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiffs' Action</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Pursuant to the above, the plaintiffs filed this action. The plaintiffs in this action comprised the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The reliefs sought by the plaintiffs in this action are, <i>inter alia</i>the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> A perusal of the plaintiffs' claim reveals that the plaintiffs' entire action concerns the manner in which the elections, (ie GE13) were conducted by the Elections Commission, the chief's complaint being the use of the indelible ink. In this regard, the plaintiffs' pleaded causes of actions were essentially as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Striking Out Application</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The defendants contended that the plaintiffs' action is "frivolous and vexatious" or "an abuse of the process of court" and hence ought to be struck out pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;19.;;">O 18 r 19(1)(b) or (d) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. As stated by the learned judge in her judgment, the defendants' application under the said Order was premised on two main grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The learned judge found that the court did not have the jurisdiction to grant the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs. Her Ladyship held that the plaintiffs were bound by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;;">Election Offences Act 1954</LINK> in that any challenge to the elections in respect of any of the 222 seats of Parliament must be by way of an election petition to an election judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned judge also held that by virtue of art <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;114.;;">114(3) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> the court did not have the necessary jurisdiction to order the removal of the defendants as members of the Elections Commission for their alleged fraud and breach of constitutional duties. The said article stipulates that members of the Elections Commission can only be removed from office "on the like grounds and in the like manner as a judge of a Federal Court", that is by a tribunal appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> For the above reasons, the learned judge found the plaintiffs' claim to be obviously sustainable and she accordingly ordered it to be struck out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;19.;;">O 18 r 19(1)(b) or (d) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issues</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> As pointed out by learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) in his written submission the issues raised by the plaintiffs in their memorandum of appeal may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiffs' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>First Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The plaintiffs contended that the learned judge erred in concluding that based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of the Federal Constitution, (art 118)</LINK> the proper and correct method in commencing this action is by way of an election petition presented separately to the election courts where the respective election was held and as such the court did not have the necessary jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' suit. In the plaintiffs' view the learned judge fell into error in construing <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> in such broad and general terms so as to oust the High Court's general jurisdiction to hear the matter.
</p>

      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">Article 118</LINK> merely provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The crux of the plaintiffs' complaint in this civil suit is "the absolute abuse or misuse of indelible ink by the Elections Commission which resulted in multiple voting on a substantial scale, which in this case caused 43 parliamentary seats to be fraudulently counted to the detriment of the plaintiffs."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The plaintiffs' causes of action therefore involve, <i>inter alia</i>, breaches by the defendant of their constitutional duties and obligations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> These causes of action can only be brought by way of a writ and not an election petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> as they fall outside the scope of the said article.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> For the same reason the plaintiffs argued that the remedies they sought in their civil suit, that is, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that the Elections Commission and its members failed in their constitutional duty to properly conduct the GE13 and a declaration that the Elections Commission and its members maliciously and dishonestly practiced fraud on the electorate, can never be granted by the election court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defendants' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The defendants, on the other hand, contended that the High Court does not have any jurisdiction to try any matter questioning an election to the Legislative Assembly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Their contention is based primarily on the language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> which according to the defendants is "couched in imperative and absolute terms."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">Article 118</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It is clear from the above provision that an election can only be called into question by an election judge hearing an election petition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In this regard the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;;">Election Offences Act 1954</LINK> is the relevant law governing election petitions and the appointment and powers of an election judge. (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;2.;;">ss 2</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;32.;;">32</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;33.;;">33 of the said Act</LINK>). Other than the said Act there is no other written law including the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> that confers jurisdiction on the High Court to question an election to the Legislative Assembly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Thus the mere pleading of the causes of actions such as breach of fundamental liberties and the torts of fraud, deceit, conspiracy and misfeasance by a Public Officer as was done by the plaintiffs, in this suit cannot confer any jurisdiction on the High Court in the face of the clear words of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The exclusive jurisdiction of the election court to hear any challenge to an election is reflected in the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of the <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_232;"><i>Election Commission, Malaysia v. Abdul Fatah Haron</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 232</LINK>; [1987] 2 MLJ 716; [1987] CLJ 92 when it held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The defendants also referred to the case of <i>NP Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer, Namakkal &amp; Ors</i> [1952] AIR SC 64 in which the Supreme Court of India dismissed an application for <i>certiorari</i>to quash the decision of a returning officer rejecting the applicant's nomination papers. In doing so the Supreme Court held that art 329(b) of the Constitution of India (which is equivalent to our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK>) was intended primarily to oust the jurisdiction of all courts in relation to electoral matters and to provide the only mode in which an election can be challenged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The other reason advanced by the defendants (in support of their contention) is that the jurisdiction to question an election is unknown to the common law and equity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Prior to the passing of legislation conferring jurisdiction to independent tribunals, the jurisdiction to question an election lie with the House of Commons. This type of legislation was described by the Privy Council in <i>Theberge v. Laudry</i> [1876-7] 2 App Cas 102 and followed by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1965_1_183;"><i>Yong Kuan Teik v.

    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The case of <i>NP Ponnuswami (supra)</i> is authority for the above proposition and has been followed by our courts in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1969_1_271;"><i>Tengku Korish v.

      <b>Our View</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. First Issue</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> On this issue we are in complete agreement with the learned judge's finding that "... the purpose and the pit (<i>sic</i>) and substance of the plaintiffs' claim is to seek an order to declare the 13th GE as null and void. The alleged breach of constitutional duty and obligation of the Elections Commission or the defendants and the alleged use of the indelible ink merely provide the basis or the foundation that will be relied upon by the plaintiffs for asking such an order."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The learned judge rightly concluded that "the proper and correct method in challenging the said election is through an election petition ..." and as such the court did not have the necessary jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The main complaint of the plaintiffs in this suit is the "absolute abuse or misuse of indelible ink" during the recent GE13 which according to them, resulted in multiple voting on a massive scale and ultimately caused the plaintiffs to lose 43 parliamentary seats in the GE13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The failure of the indelible ink, the plaintiffs contended, was caused primarily if not solely by the defendants' breach of their duties and obligations under the Constitution which breach vitiated the election results.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Accordingly the plaintiffs' pleaded causes of action against the defendants are for:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The plaintiffs contended that the learned judge was wrong in allowing the defendants' application to strike out the writ because:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The issue before us is essentially one of jurisdiction, that is whether the High Court has the jurisdiction to quash an election petition by way of a writ action where a breach of constitutional duty and fundamental liberties is alleged against the Elections Commission, (ie the defendants) and fraud, deceit, conspiracy and misfeasance by a Public Officer is alleged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In our view it is unequivocally clear from the language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of the Constitution</LINK>, that in Malaysia an election can only be questioned by an election judge trying an election petition. As submitted by learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> is "couched in imperative and absolute terms". (see para 23 of this judgment).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The effect of the aforesaid provision is that the High Court is excluded from exercising any jurisdiction over all matters that call into question an election be it to the House of Representation or to the State Assembly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;32.;;">s 32</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;33.;;">s 33(1) of the Elections Offences Act 1954</LINK> (the law pertaining to election petition) an election petition is to be tried by an election judge which under the said Act is defined as a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Judge to try an election petition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_232;"><i>Election Commission, Malaysia v. Abdul Fatah Haron</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 232</LINK>; [1987] 2 MLJ 716; [1987] CLJ 92 stated in no uncertain terms that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The plaintiffs sought to argue that their pleaded causes of action <i>inter alia</i>, breaches of the Constitution, fraud, deceit, conspiracy and misfeasance by a Public Officer cannot be the subject matter of an election petition as the latter is limited in its scope both as to the causes of action and the remedies available.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> However, as the plaintiffs themselves admitted in their written submission, the essence of their complaint in the civil suit is the absolute abuse or misuse of indelible ink by the Elections Commission (ie the defendants) "which resulted in multiple voting on a substantial scale, which in turn caused about 43 parliamentary seats to be fraudulently counted to the detriment of the plaintiffs."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The plaintiffs, vide their civil suit is in effect calling into question or rather challenging the results of the GE13. The plaintiffs' claim therefore falls squarely within the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> and as such can only be brought by way of an election petition to be heard by an election judge and not by way of a civil suit to be adjudicated upon by a judge in the exercise of his or her ordinary civil jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> We agree with the learned SFC that the mere pleading of the causes of action cannot purport to confer jurisdiction on the High Court as the effect of these causes of action and the reliefs sought is to call into question the elections, (ie GE13) which by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> is vested solely with the election court. Any attempt to confer jurisdiction on the High Court by pleading such causes of action would amount to a violation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In this regard we agree with the learned judge that the case of <i>Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms</i> [2002] 5 SCC 294 cited by the plaintiffs</p>
    <p>in support of their case can be distinguished. The aforesaid case concerns a voter's right to information about a candidate standing for elections and the parties they represent. It was not a case which questioned the elections or the results of the election.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The Supreme Court rightly held that the High Court had the necessary powers under art 226 of the Indian Constitution (which is <i>in pari materia</i> with para 1 of the Schedule of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>) to make an order that for voters to make a right choice it is essential that the history of the candidates be disclosed to the voters and for this purpose the Elections Commission is empowered to issue the directions as ordered by the High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Our position as enshrined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> is similar to the position in India where art 329(b) of the Constitution of India provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The Indian Supreme Court's observation on the scope and effect of art 329(b) in <i>NP Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer, Namakkal &amp; Ors (supra)</i> is instructive for our purpose:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> There the appellant had moved the High Court under art 226 of the Indian Constitution for a writ of <i>certiorari</i>
to quash the order of the Returning Officer rejecting his nomination papers and to direct the Returning Officer to include his name in the list of valid nominations to be published. The High Court dismissed the appellant's application on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Returning Officer by reason of the provisions of art 226 of the Constitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The appellant contended that the view expressed by the High Court is not correct, the jurisdiction of the High Court is not affected by art 329(b) of the Indian Constitution and that he was entitled to a writ of <i>certiorari</i> in the circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The Supreme Court, dismissed the appeal holding that the improper rejection of a nomination paper is a ground on which an election may be called into question and therefore by virtue of art 329(b) the only mode provided for such a challenge was by way of an election petition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> One of the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs in the present case is a declaration that the results announced by the defendants for all the 222 parliamentary seats should be declared null and void, and hence an order setting aside the results of all the said 222 seats.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The plaintiffs' suit is premised on the alleged misuse of the indelible ink which they claimed resulted in Pakatan Rakyat losing the GE13 by approximately 43 seats with narrow majorities of less than 10% of the vote. They further contended that the "massive cheating caused by the washing away of the indelible ink destroyed the integrity of the entire voting process of GE13. It vitiates the results of GE13."</p>
    <p>(see paras 76-81, pp 122-123 of the Record of Appeal, Bah A).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr T Thomas argued that as the plaintiffs here are seeking to nullify the entire results of GE13 they could not do so by way of an election petition. According to learned counsel, the true effect and scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> is that any challenge to an election result in a specific constituency for a parliamentary seat or a state seat must be by way of an election petition to any election court. This includes challenges to an election result in both general elections and by-elections.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Thus, where in this case the plaintiffs are seeking to challenge the entire results of the GE13, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> cannot apply and recourse can only be had by filing an action in the High Court to declare the GE13 null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> We are unable to agree with learned counsel's submission. We would only refer to the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in <i>Indrajit Barua v. Election Commission of India</i> [1985] 9 LAWS(SC) 42 where the Supreme Court, in dismissing a petition to nullify the elections on the ground that the holding of elections on the basis of the void electoral rolls of 1979 was contrary to law and vitiated the elections, held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> We are of the view that the legal position <i>vis-a-vis</i> art 329(b) of the Indian Constitution read together with the Representation of the People Act 1951 as lucidly enunciated by the Supreme Court (above) applies equally here based on the equipollent provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of our Constitution</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;;">Elections Offences Act 1954</LINK>. What <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_5;;">Elections Offences Act 1954</LINK> contemplate is election from each constituency and it is that election which is liable to be challenged by filing an election petition. As observed by the Supreme Court even where in form the challenge is to the elections as a whole, in effect and substance what is challenged is election from each constituency, and, in our case, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> must therefore be held to be attracted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In fact this was alluded to by the learned High Court Judge when she held that "the proper and correct method in challenging the said election is through an election petition presented separately to the election court where the respective election was held and not by way of the present action where the plaintiffs are seeking to declare all the 222 seats of Parliament and the entire 13th GE as null and void."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Finally learned counsel sought to argue that, even if the court does not have the jurisdiction to grant the order declaring the GE13 null and void, the court has the jurisdiction to grant the first two declarations sought for by the plaintiffs which in his view are "self-standing".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The first two declarations sought by the plaintiffs are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> We find, with respect, learned counsel's argument untenable. We agree with learned SFC that prayers (1) and (2) cannot stand independently. The ultimate effect of these orders would be to render the GE13 null and void and as such would attract the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In the light of our finding above we do not think it necessary to express our view on the defendants' submission that as the jurisdiction to question an election is not known to the common law and equity the plaintiffs cannot avail themselves to any of the common law tortious cases of action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Second Issu</b>e</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> It is the plaintiffs' contention that the learned judge erred in holding that the principle in <i>R Rama Chandran (supra)</i> does not apply in the present case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> In our view the learned judge did not err in holding as such. As submitted by learned SFC the Federal Court when enunciating the principle was dealing with a case where the High Court was exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;25.;;">s 25</LINK> read together with para 1 of the Schedule to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. The Federal Court held that the High Court in <i>certiorari</i> proceedings not only had the power to quash the impugned decision but could mould the relief in accordance with the exigencies of the situation in order to satisfy the demands of justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> In the instant case these is no question of the court exercising its power to mould the relief as the court does not in the first place, have the jurisdiction to hear the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Third Issue</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> On this issue too we have no reason to disagree with the learned judge's finding. It is clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;114.;;">art 114(3) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> that the High Court does not have the jurisdiction to remove members of the Elections Commission from their office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;114.;;">Article 114(3)</LINK> provides that members of the Elections Commission can only be removed from office on the like grounds and manner as that of a judge of a Federal Court. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;114.;;">Article 114(3)</LINK> reads thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The manner in which a judge of the Federal Court can be removed from office is provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;125.;;">art 125(3) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> which states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Thus, as with a judge of the Federal Court the jurisdiction to remove members of the Elections Commission is vested with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong acting on the recommendation of the tribunal set up for that purpose. The High Court therefore does not have any jurisdiction to make an order for the removal of the defendants from their office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> In any event it is our view that this issue is contingent upon whether the court finds it has the jurisdiction to hear the matter. As found by the learned judge the alleged breach of constitutional duty by the defendants and other alleged wrongdoing as pleaded merely provide the foundation upon which the plaintiffs are challenging the validity of the GE13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> As such <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118</LINK> would apply and the (High) Court is bereft of any jurisdiction to hear the matter. That being the case the issue of whether the court has the jurisdiction to remove members of the Elections Commission from office does not really arise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> For the above reasons we find the learned judge was correct in holding that the court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' suit and it ought therefore to be struck out for being vexatious, frivolous and an abuse of the process of court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> We accordingly, by a majority, dismiss the appeal and affirm the learned judge's decision. We make no order as to costs. The deposit is refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> This appeal arose out of a decision of the learned judge in Kuala Lumpur High Court, striking out the appellants' claim in its entirety with costs. The appellants appealed to this court, and by a majority judgment delivered on 17 September 2014 the appeal was dismissed. I dissented and allowed the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> Before I deal with Her Ladyship's judgment in the Kuala Lumpur High Court, let me first refer to the relief sought in the plaintiffs' statement of claim found in (p 127 of the Appeal Record Bahagian A vol 1/8). The first two reliefs sought are declaratory reliefs and the rest are consequential relief. The thrust of the relief sought was to set aside the 2014 General Elections and nullify the same and for the seeking of the removal of the Election Commission Members, amongst the other relief sought. In the application to strike out the appellants' pleading, the respondents argue that the relief sought was to avoid the General Election results in 2014 and for removal of the members of the Election Commission. It was argued that the Election results could only be set aside through an Election Petition and the dismissal of Election Commission members was clearly provided for in the Federal Constitution. It follows that since the relief sought is unsustainable, the suit should be struck out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> This argument appears to have found favour with the learned judge in her grounds of judgment (see p 33 to p 38 of the Appeal Record), the learned judge predicated her reasoning on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;118.;;">art 118 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> and accordingly struck out the appellant's statement of claim and dismissed the appellant's claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> Before this court, the same arguments were presented. Bearing in mind that this was an application to strike out the appellant's claim and the duty of the Court was to save the pleadings by amendment rather than striking out, (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_104;"><i>Muniandy Subrayan &amp; Ors v. Chairman And Board Members, Koperasi Menara Maju Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 104</LINK>; [1997] 1 CLJ 417; [1997] 1 MLJ 557; [1997] 1 AMR 989), I considered the relief prayed for in prayer (1) of the statement of claim. Here the appellants were seeking purely declaratory relief in terms of the exercise of the Constitutional Powers and Duties of the respondents under the Federal Constitution read together with the Elections Act 1958 and Regulations. In my judgment prayer (1) can stand on its own, seeking a declaratory order without any consequential relief. It would follow that all the appellants would obtain is a declaration on whether the respondents were in breach of their constitutional duties in the conduct of elections. It is a sustainable argument to advance, that whilst it is open to mount a claim against the respondents on this basis, but where the election process is challenged and where an election result is to be avoided, then only you must proceed through an Election Petition.

      <b>[82]</b> The Federal Constitution, being the Supreme Law of the Federation imposes a constitutional duty on the respondents to conduct Elections in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;113.;;">art 113(1)</LINK> of the same. Read together with the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1970_19;;">Elections Act 1958</LINK> and Regulations (Act 19), an act that was promulgated for conduct of Elections to the Dewan Rakyat and to the Legislative Assemblies of the respective states (the said Act). Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1970_19;5.;;">s 5(1)(a) of the said Act</LINK> under the heading general powers and duties of the Election Commission it is provided and I quote:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> It is open for the appellants to raise by way of a declaration whether the respondents had breached their constitutional duty to conduct the General Elections of 2013 with fairness. At any rate this is an important issue that should not be summarily disposed of.

    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> The other point raised by the respondents is despite prayer (1) of the statement of claim being couched in declaratory terms, its thrust was to avoid the election results despite an absence of consequential relief. In my judgment, seeking a declaration of rights without consequential relief should be encouraged since the law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;41.;;">s 41 of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> allows the same and I quote:</p>

      <b>[86]</b> In the light of the aforesaid it is my finding that this is not a fit and proper case for summary disposal by way of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;19.;;">O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>.</p>
