    <p>The appellant, of mixed parentage, converted to Islam upon marriage and thereafter successfully applied to the District Native Court to be determined as a Native Malay of Sarawak. Her status as a Native Malay of Sarawak was gazetted in the Sarawak Government Gazette on 21 July 2005. The appellant became involved in a dispute with the 1st respondent over the ownership of several parcels of Native Customary Rights land ("NCR land") that had been acquired by the Sarawak State Government. Both the appellant and the 1st respondent claimed ownership over the NCR land for the sake of the compensation payable as a consequence of the land acquisition. The appellant claimed that she had acquired the NCR land from their original Malay owners based on the custom of serah on payment of sagu hati. The dispute was brought to the Native Courts where at first instance, a trial in the Chief's Court ended in the appellant's favour. The 1st respondent appealed to the Chief's Superior Court which dismissed his appeal. The 1st respondent appealed further to the District Native Court which allowed his appeal and overturned the earlier decisions. The District Court held, <i>inter alia</i> , that at the time the appellant acquired the NCR land in 2000, she was not a native of Sarawak as she was only gazetted a Native Malay of Sarawak on 21 July 2005. Thus, she had no locus in any action before a Native Court. The appellant's appeals thereafter to the Resident's Native Court and the Native Court of Appeal were both unsuccessful. The appellant applied <i>ex parte</i> to the High Court of Kuching for leave to file a judicial review application pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>, with a view to obtaining an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the decision of the Native Court of Appeal. The High Court judge directed the application be served on the respondents and after hearing the parties, refused to grant the appellant leave. The High Court held that a decision of the Native Court of Appeal was not amenable to judicial review. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal would prefer the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in <i>Haji Laugan Tarki</i> .The Native Courts of Sarawak were established by the State law of Sarawak and like the Native Courts of Sabah, in relation to the High Court, were inferior tribunals. Like other inferior tribunals, the High Court might exercise control over the Native Courts through the prerogative orders. The decision of the Native Court of Appeal of Sarawak was thus amenable to judicial review by the High Court. <i>Haji Laugan Tarki Bin Mohd Noor v.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal deals with this question: whether a decision of the Native Court of Appeal of Sarawak is amenable to judicial review by the High Court?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at Kuching ('the High Court of Kuching'), on 15 April 2013, agreeing with the respondents' submission before it, answered this question in the negative and refused to grant leave to the appellant to file an application for judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In refusing to grant leave, the High Court did not hear the leave application on the merits. The High Court merely ruled that it had no jurisdiction to hear the <i>ex parte</i> application on the ground that the decision of the Native Court of Appeal was not amenable to judicial review by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Hence the present appeal to this court by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 17 April 2015, after hearing submissions, we unanimously allowed the appeal, but with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In allowing the appeal, we ruled that a decision of the Native Court of Appeal is amenable to judicial review by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We now give our reasons for so holding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant, Lynawati Abdullah, is of mixed parentage: her father is Chinese, and her mother, a Bidayuh. On 24 January 1983 she married a Sarawak Malay, one Jalal bin Mohi. Upon marriage, she converted to Islam. She faithfully practiced the Islamic faith, observed Malay customs and spoke Malay. The appellant thereafter applied to the District Native Court under s 20 of the Native Courts Ordinance 1992 of Sarawak for a determination that she is a Native Malay of Sarawak. She succeeded in her application. Her status as a Native Malay of Sarawak was published in the Sarawak Government Gazette Vol LX No 29 on 21 July 2005 vide Gazette Notification No 2279.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant is involved in a dispute with the 1st respondent, Abang Sukori Abang Haji Gobil, over the ownership of six parcels of native customary rights land situated in Kuching North Land District ('the disputed parcels of land').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The disputed parcels of land had been acquired by the State Government of Sarawak for the purpose of building a public road. Whoever was the rightful owner of the disputed parcels of land is entitled to compensation from the State Government. Both the appellant and the 1st respondent claim ownership over the disputed parcels of land. Both are claiming compensation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant claims that she had acquired the disputed parcels of land from their original Malay owners based on the custom of serah (that is, transfer) on payment of sagu hati (that is, compensation).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The dispute between the appellant and the 1st respondent over the ownership of the disputed parcels of land culminated in a series of proceedings in the Native Courts. First, there was the trial before the Chief's Court, Kuching. The Chief's Court decided in favour of the appellant. </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The 1st respondent, dissatisfied with the decision of the Chief's Court, appealed to the Chief's Superior Court, at Kuching. But his appeal was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Still dissatisfied, the 1st respondent took the matter further by appealing to the District Native Court, Kuching. The District Native Court allowed his appeal and overturned the decisions of the Chief's Court and the Chief's Superior Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In allowing the 1st respondent's appeal, the District Native Court held that the appellant was not a native of Sarawak ('a non-native') at the time when she acquired the disputed parcels of land in the year 2000, as she was gazetted as a native Malay of Sarawak only on 21 July 2005; and thus she had no locus in any action before a Native Court. The District Native Court declared the proceedings before the Chief's Court and the Chief's Superior Chief's Court null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the District Native Court, the appellant appealed to the Resident's Native Court at Kuching. The Resident's Native Court dismissed her appeal and upheld the decision of the District Native Court that the appellant was a non-native and that the 1st respondent was the rightful owner of the disputed parcels of land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant then appealed to the Native Court of Appeal at Kuching, but her appeal was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Thereafter, being aggrieved by the decision of the Native Court of Appeal, in dismissing her appeal, the appellant applied <i>ex parte</i> to the High Court of Kuching for leave to file a judicial review application pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> with a view to obtaining an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the decision of the Native Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Several grounds were advanced by the appellant in her judicial review application, one of which is that the Native Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that she was a non-native. But we are not concerned with the merits of the judicial review application for the purpose of this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Although the application was <i>ex parte</i> ,the learned High Court Judge, taking the view that the matter raised a 'novel and interesting point of law', on her own volition, directed that the application be served on the respondents; and the latter were invited to make submissions. The State Legal Officer on behalf of the respondents did submit before the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The High Court of Kuching, having heard parties, refused to grant leave to the appellant to apply for judicial review, ruling that a decision of the Native Court of Appeal is not amenable to judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The structure of Native Courts in Sarawak In a nutshell, in Sarawak, in addition to the Civil Courts and the Syariah Courts, there are the Native Courts. The Native Courts comprise six tiers, namely: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The Native Courts deal with:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> However, the administration of the native law and custom in Sarawak by the Native Courts is subject to certain restrictions. The law provides that the Native Courts have no jurisdiction in respect of any cause or matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Courts or the Civil Courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> With regard to criminal offences, the power to impose punishment is restricted by a federal law: the Native Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act 1991 ('the Act'). The Act only confers jurisdiction on the Native Courts of Sabah and Sarawak to try any offence (relating to native law and custom) punishable with a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or with a fine not exceeding RM5,000.00 or a combination of both. The Act further provides that criminal jurisdiction cannot be exercised by the Native Courts in respect of an offence which is also an offence under the Penal Code.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The Sarawak Native Courts Ordinance 1992 provides for the structure of the Native Courts system of Sarawak. The relevant provisions are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Power of the appellate court</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The appellant's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Encik Simon Siah, the learned counsel for the appellant, submits before us that a decision of the Native Court of Appeal is amenable to judicial review based on the decision of the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1988_1_453;"><i>Haji Laugan Tarki Bin Mohd Noor v. Mahkamah Anak Negeri Penampang</i> [1988] 1 MLRA 453</LINK>; [1988] 2 MLJ 85. In this case Hashim Yeop Sani SCJ (as he then was), delivering the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court (the other two members of the panel comprising Salleh Abas LP and Seah SCJ), held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Respondents' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The learned State Legal Officer, Encik Nur Azhar bin Bujang, on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, submits that the decision of the Native Court of Appeal is not amenable to judicial review. He relies on the High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1982_1_779;"><i>Ongkong Anak Salleh v. David Panggau Sandin &amp; Anor</i> [1982] 1 MLRH 779</LINK>; [1983] 1 MLJ 419. In this case cited, Seah J (as he then was; interestingly, five years later His Lordship sat as a Supreme Court Judge in <i>Haji Laugan Tarki</i>) held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In holding that the decision of the Native Court of Appeal is not amenable to judicial review by the High Court, the learned High Court Judge opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On <i>Haji Laugan</i> , the learned High Court Judge, in deciding not to follow the decision of that case, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In our judgment, we prefer the principle as laid down by the Supreme Court in <i>Haji Laugan Tarki</i> . With respect, we are not persuaded by the reasons given by the learned High Court Judge for not following <i>Haji Laugan Tarki</i> . The Native Courts of Sarawak are established by the State law of Sarawak (the legislation enacted pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">Item 13 of List IIA</LINK> for the State List for Sabah and Sarawak of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution</LINK>). They are, like the Native Courts of Sabah, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak, inferior tribunals. And like other inferior tribunals, the High Court may exercise control over the Native Courts through the prerogative orders. We, therefore, hold that the decision of the Native Court of Appeal of Sarawak is amenable to judicial review by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Accordingly, we allow the appeal but with no order as to costs. The order of the High Court is set aside. The matter is remitted to the High Court for the High Court to hear the appellant's leave application on the merits.</p>
