    <p>The State Authority of Terengganu decided to acquire the appellant's land for a public purpose and thus gazetted an official notification in Form D of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK> ('LAA') on 21 July 2005 pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the LAA</LINK>. The acquisition exercise also included part of the adjacent land belonging to the 2nd respondent. Subsequently, a notification in Form E of the LAA was issued on 28 February 2006 and served on the appellant on 7 March 2006. Later, the 1st respondent served upon the appellant a notice of award in Form H of the LAA dated 27 November 2007. The appellant rejected the award in Form H by a letter dated 19 December 2007 and indicated its intention to set aside the award and acquisition. On 6 January 2008, the appellant filed an <i>ex parte</i> application for leave to proceed with judicial review in the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC 1980') (now Rules of Court 2012)</LINK>. The respondents were not present at the <i>ex parte</i> hearing of the application. Leave was granted and the appellant filed the substantive application for judicial review alleging, amongst others, that the acquisition was <i>ultra vires</i> the LAA as it was for the sole benefit of the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>The 2nd respondent raised two preliminary objections. The 1st objection was that the judicial review application was filed outside the stipulated 40- day time frame under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> and consequently should be dismissed <i>in limine</i>. The 2nd objection was that the proper party, the State Authority, was not named as the respondent. The High Court did not deal with the preliminary objections but dismissed the substantive application for judicial review. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal and the 2nd respondent raised the same preliminary objections again. The Court of Appeal upheld the objections and dismissed the appeal. The appellant now appealed before the Federal Court. The questions posed before the court raised the following issues: (i) whether the Land Administrator's award must be served and communicated to a landowner within two years as prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK> and failure to serve thereof would cause the acquisition to lapse and cease to have effect; (ii) whether the application for judicial review was filed within the 40-day time frame under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>; (iii) whether the 40-day time frame under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> should run from the date of service of Form H on the appellant; (iv) whether the respondents were barred and estopped from raising the preliminary objections before the Court of Appeal; and (v) whether the respondents were deemed to have waived their rights to raise the preliminary objections, having failed to raise them during the leave stage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal with costs)</p>
    <p>(Per Ramly Ali FCJ with Richard Malanjum CJSS, Mohamed Apandi Ali, Abu Samah Nordin FCJJ concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The wording of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of LAA</LINK> was clear and unambiguous, ie that the twoyear period started from the date of publication of the declaration in Form D in the gazette. After the publication of Form D in the gazette, the Land Administrator had to conduct and conclude an enquiry under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;12.;;">s 12 of the LAA</LINK>, and upon such conclusion of the enquiry, the Land Administrator should, within the period of two years from the date of the gazette, prepare a written award in Form G. If no award was made and Form G was not prepared by the Land Administrator within the two-year period, the declaration in Form D should lapse and cease to be of any effect. There was no provision in the LAA indicating that Form H must be served on or communicated to the landowner within two years from the date of publication of Form D in the gazette. (paras 15-20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Form D was gazetted on 21 July 2005 and the award in Form G pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(1) of the LAA</LINK> was made on 3 August 2006. For the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK>, the award in Form G was well within the two-year period from the date of the gazette of Form D. That being the case the issue of failure to serve Form H in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4)</LINK> as raised by the appellant did not arise. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8(4)</LINK> only related to the making of an award and the preparation of Form G by the Land Administrator. It did not relate to the service of Form H to the landowner or other interested parties. (paras 24-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 of the RHC 1980</LINK> governed the appellant's judicial review application at the material time. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> there was a 40-day time frame to file the application from the date when the grounds for the application first arose or when the decision was first communicated to the applicant. The decision must be brought to the applicant's actual notice or knowledge in order for him to prepare his case. In order to bring <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> into play, it was crucial to first identify the decision to be challenged by the applicant in the judicial review proceedings. The appellant prayed for an order of <i>certiorari</i> to set aside the decision of the 1st respondent to acquire part of the appellant's land published in the government gazette dated 21 July 2005. The appellant's objection at all material times was against the acquisition of its land and not as to the quantum of the award made by the Land Administrator. (paras 32-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The first written notice to the appellant was Form E under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(1) of the LAA</LINK> served on the appellant on 7 March 2006. Application for leave for judicial review filed on 6 January 2008 was almost 22 months after Form E was served. That was clearly beyond the 40-day time frame under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. As such, there was inordinate delay on the part of the appellant in filing for judicial review and there was no indication to show that the appellant applied for an extension of time. (para 67)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Form H of the LAA was not the starting point to calculate when the 40-day time frame under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> started to run as contended by the appellant. Form H was issued based on the award by the Land Administrator under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(1) of the LAA</LINK>. It included an extract from the written award of the Land Administrator in Form G. It was a notice of award and offer of compensation in respect of the land acquired. It did not convey the decision of the State Authority to acquire the land (which formed the subject matter of the judicial review). The decision to acquire was earlier conveyed to the appellant in Form E on 7 March 2006. It was through Form E that the decision of the State Authority to acquire the land was first communicated to the appellant as the registered owner of the land in question. (para 68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 of the RHC 1980</LINK> set out a specific procedure for an applicant to comply with in order to enable him to invoke the judicial review proceedings. When such an explicit procedure was created, all applicants for such relief must adhere to the procedure, failing which the application would not be entertained by the court. In the present case, there was clear non-compliance by the appellant with the imperative requirement of time set under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. Strict compliance with the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> was mandatory as reflected in the usage of the word "shall" therein. There could be no exceptions unless an extension of time was applied for and obtained. (paras 69-70)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> Both respondents were not present in court at the <i>ex parte</i> hearing for the leave application. As such, the respondents could not be expected to raise any preliminary objections at that stage. The first appearance by both respondents in the application was when the application was heard <i>inter parte</i>, and was the first and the earliest opportunity for them to appear and raise the preliminary objections. Although an officer from the Attorney General's Chambers was present in court at the hearing for leave, his presence was based on the notice given by the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(2) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. The presence of the officer did not mean that he was representing the 1st respondent particularly when the application for leave was made <i>ex parte (Chow Hong Lit lwn. YB Menteri Sumber Manusia Malaysia &amp; Satu Lagi)</i>. The position was clear that the officer from the Attorney General's Chambers at the leave stage did not represent the respondents. Therefore both respondents could not be barred and estopped from raising the preliminary objections at the <i>inter parte</i> hearing of the substantive application. The question of whether they waived their rights to raise the preliminary objections also did not arise. (paras 76-80)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> As there was non-compliance with the 40-day time frame to file the application, the High Court had no jurisdiction to hear the appellant's application for judicial review. Leave should not have been granted in the first place and the High Court should not have proceeded to hear the substantive application on merit. It was the cardinal principle of law that the court could not confer jurisdiction upon itself when none existed. Appeals to the Court of Appeal shall be by way of rehearing and in relation to such appeals, the Court of Appeal shall have all the powers and duties of the High Court. It followed that the respondents were at liberty to raise the preliminary objections when the case came up for appeal at the Court of Appeal particularly when the High Court judge failed to consider their objections earlier. The Court of Appeal was right in hearing the preliminary objections and subsequently dismissing the appeal after allowing the objections. (paras 81-82)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The preliminary objections were first raised in the High Court. Thereafter at the Court of Appeal written submissions were filed in advance of the hearing of the appeal as well as the preliminary objections. Then, the hearing of the appeal was adjourned to another date to enable counsel for the appellant to be prepared to argue the preliminary objections. Therefore, it was not correct for the appellant to claim that it was not given prior notice on the preliminary objections raised at the Court of Appeal. (para 83)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> As the 1st preliminary objection was allowed and upheld, it was not necessary to deal with the 2nd preliminary objection and the merits of the substantive application. (para 85)</p>
    <p>Per Zaleha Zahari FCJ (supporting judgment):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal was right in entertaining the preliminary objections raised by the respondents at the appellate stage and had the jurisdiction to do so. Decisions of this apex court had throughout the years consistently held that compliance with the time frame prescribed in the rules was fundamental as it went to jurisdiction. (para 122)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> An aggrieved person was required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> to act promptly, and in any event, not later than 40 days from the date when the grounds for the application first arose or when the decision was first communicated to the appellant. The intention of the rules in limiting a prescribed period must necessarily be construed to mean that it was in the public interest that an aggrieved person's right of access to the court had to yield to the need for a swift finality of the decision in question. (para 125)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The main thrust of the appellant's case rested on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK> which provision was inserted into <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8</LINK> vide the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 1984 (Act A 575). According to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4)</LINK>, a declaration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK> shall lapse and cease to be of any effect on the expiry of two years after the date of its publication in the gazette in respect of which the Land Administrator had not made an award under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">sub-s 14(1)</LINK> within a period of two years. In such a situation all proceedings already taken or being taken in consequence of such a declaration in respect of such land or such part of the land shall terminate and be of no effect. (para 129)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The mode of communication of the decision was <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the LAA</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8(1)</LINK> was the operative provision with regard to the notification of the State Authority's decision of its intention to acquire land and for what purpose. In respect of an acquisition of land the publication of such an intention in the gazette in Form D afforded the public, and the appellant in particular, the most practical and sensible way in which to give notice of the State Authority's intended acquisition. Giving the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK> its plain and ordinary meaning, the intention of the legislature presumed that the notice of the public was sufficiently drawn to the acquisition by way of publication in the gazette. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8(1)</LINK> established positively and as a fact that this acquisition was to the knowledge of the appellant. If the law fixed the public with knowledge, and deemed such knowledge to be a fact, this court must necessarily give effect to it. (para 132)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The Court of Appeal was right in ruling that the filing of the application for leave to apply judicial review for an order of <i>certiorari</i> must be filed within 40 days of the publication of Form D in the gazette and not the service of Form H. In this case the Form D declaration of the intended acquisition was gazetted on 21 July 2005. The leave application was filed on 6 January 2008. The appellant had clearly not acted promptly within the 40 days prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. The application clearly was filed years beyond the time frame prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>. (para 133)</p>
    <p>(6) The Court of Appeal was right in stating that the law relating to extension of time for judicial review was clear. The appellant did not apply for an extension of time and gave no reason for the delay. There was thus no basis warranting the court to exercise its discretionary power to extend time. (para 134)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal, by the appellant, Kijal Resort Sdn Bhd against the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal dated 1 August 2012 dismissing the appellant's appeal on preliminary objections against the decision of the High Court dated 21 June 2009 dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review to quash the decision of the Land Administrator. The appellant had on 30 July 2013 obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (CJA 1964)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Factual Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant, at all material times, was the registered proprietor of part of the land known as Lot 3168, Mukim Kijal, Daerah Kemaman, Negeri Terengganu. The State Authority of Terengganu had decided to acquire the said land for public purpose. For that purpose an official notification as in Form D of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960 (the LAA)</LINK> was gazetted in the government gazette on 21 July 2005 pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the Act</LINK>. The acquisition exercise also included part of the adjacent land, known as Lot 33, Mukim Kijal, Daerah Kemaman, Negeri Terengganu, belonging to the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Subsequently, a notification in Form E of the LAA was issued on 28 February 2006 and served on the appellant on 7 March 2006. Later the 1st respondent served upon the appellant a notice of award in Form H of the LAA dated 27 November 2007. By letter dated 19 December 2007, the appellant rejected the award and indicated its intention to set aside the entire award and the acquisition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant then filed an <i>ex parte</i> application in the High Court on 6 January 2008, for leave to proceed with judicial review pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3 of the RHC 1980</LINK>, naming the Pentadbir Tanah Daerah, Kemaman as the 1st respondent and a company known as Maju Timor Sdn Bhd as the 2nd respondent. As required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(3) of the RHC 1980</LINK>, the appellant had given to the Attorney General Chambers a notice of the application. Accordingly, a Senior Federal Counsel from the Attorney General's Chambers was present at the hearing of the <i>ex parte</i> application. The 1st and 2nd respondents were neither present nor represented and did not participate at the <i>ex parte</i> leave stage. Leave was accordingly granted to the appellant to proceed with the judicial review, on 20 May 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Pursuant to the leave granted, the appellant filed its substantive application for judicial review on 1 June 2008 and served the same on the 1st and 2nd respondents, who then filed their respective affidavits in reply and opposition to the application. The 2nd respondent was named as a party in the proceedings as it was alleged that the acquisition was <i>ultra vires</i> the LAA because it was for the sole benefit of the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the hearing of the substantive judicial review application, the 2nd respondent raised preliminary objections on 2 points, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Apparently from the notes of proceedings and the grounds of judgment, the High Court did not deal with the two preliminary points at all; instead it proceeded to hear substantive submissions on the application for judicial review and on 21 June 2009 dismissed the application with costs on merit of the substantive issues. The learned High Court Judge did not mention anything about the two preliminary objections raised by the 2nd respondent in his ground of judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On appeal by the appellant to the Court of Appeal, the 2nd respondent, once again raised the two preliminary objections when the case came up for hearing on the first date on 25 June 2012. The hearing was postponed to 31 July 2012, to give the appellant sufficient time to rebut the two preliminary objections. On 31 July 2012, the Court of Appeal heard submissions from the parties on the two preliminary objections and on 1 August 2012, the Court of Appeal upheld the objections and accordingly dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 30 July 2013, the appellant was granted leave to appeal to the Federal Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the following questions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>At The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We shall now deal with all the questions posed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Question 1 and Question 2 relate to the issue of service of Form H of the Land Administrator's award, ie whether it must be served and communicated to a land owner within two years as prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK>; and whether failure to serve it would cause the acquisition to lapse and cease to have effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The relevant section to be considered in determining this issue is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK>, which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant contended that the two years period stipulated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK> is to be calculated from the date of the gazette of Form D to the date of issuance of Form H; while on the other hand, both the respondents contended that the two years period is to be calculated from the date of the gazette of Form D to the date of issuance of Form G, but not Form H.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant submitted, that Form G is clearly intended only for the internal use of the Land Administrator and does not constitute a communication of the award to the land owner. Form G would not be made available to the interested parties until a notice of the award in Form H is served on them. To the appellant, Form H must be served and communicated to the land owner within two years from the date of the gazette of Form D and the failure to do so would cause the acquisition to lapse and cease to have any effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The wordings of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK> on this point is clear and unambiguous, ie the declaration in question "shall lapse and cease be of any effect on the expiry of two years after the date of its publication in the gazette in so far as it relates to any land or part of any land in respect of which the Land Administrator has not made an award under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">subsection 14(1)</LINK> within the said period of the two years ..." In other words, the two years period starts from the date of publication of the declaration in Form D in the gazette to the date when the Land Administrator made an award under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">subsection 14(1)</LINK> of the same Act. The declaration would only be valid and effective if the award is made within the two years period.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">Section 14(1) of the LAA</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Form G is a written award prepared by the Land Administrator upon the conclusion of an enquiry under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;12.;;">s 12</LINK>. The purpose of the said enquiry is to determine the value of the scheduled land and to assess the amount of compensation appropriate in each case. In the enquiry the Land Administrator must also determine the respective interest of all persons claiming compensation or who in his opinion are entitled to compensation in respect of the scheduled land. Only upon the conclusion of the enquiry when all relevant determinations are made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;12.;;">s 12</LINK>, the Land Administrator shall prepare a written award under his hand in Form G.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Form H comes into the picture at a later stage. It is issued by the Land Administrator under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;16.;;">s 16 of the LAA</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(2) of the LAA</LINK>, every award in Form G shall be filed in the office of the Land Administrator and shall be final and conclusive evidence of the area of any scheduled land, of its value and of the apportionment of the compensation awarded by the Land Administrator. There is no provision for Form G, by itself, to be served on anyone. What need to be served on each person interested in the land is Form H which shall include an extract from the written award in Form G.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Reading <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK> together with other relevant sections, particularly <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;12.;;">ss 12</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">14</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;16.;;">16</LINK>, of the same Act it is plain and unambiguous that what need to be done by the Land Administrator after the publication of Form D in the gazette is to conduct and conclude an enquiry under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;12.;;">s 12</LINK>, and upon such conclusion of the enquiry the Land Administrator shall within the period of two years from the date of the gazette prepare a written award in Form G. If no award is made and Form G is not prepared by the Land Administrator within the two years period, the declaration in Form D shall lapse and cease to be of any effect. There is no provision in the LAA which indicates that Form H must be served on or communicated to the land owner within two years, from the date of publication of Form D in the gazette.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is a settled rule of statutory interpretation that if the precise words used are plain and unambiguous, the court is bound to construe them in their ordinary sense. This has been stressed in <i>Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes</i> (7th edn) at p 491 in the following passage:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In <i>Avel v. Lee</i> [1871] LR 6 CP 365, Willes J said: "I utterly repudiate the motion that it is competent to a judge to modify the language of an Act of Parliament in order to bring it accordance with his views so as to what is right and reasonable."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The above authorities were adopted by the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_4_74;"><i>Ex P Guan Teik Sdn Bhd (Substituting Lim Oo Guan, Deceased)</i> [2009] 4 MLRA 74</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 1; [2010] 4 CLJ 289.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the present case before us Form D was published in the gazette on 21 July 2005 via Gazette Notification no 469 and the award in Form G pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(1) of the LAA</LINK>, was made on 3 August 2006. For the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK>, the said award in Form G was well within the two years period from the date of the gazette of Form D.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> That being the case the issue of failure to serve Form H in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4) of the LAA</LINK> as raised by the appellant in Question 2 does not arise. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8(4)</LINK> only relates to the making of an award and preparing Form G by the Land Administrator. It does not relate to service of Form H to the land owner or other interested parties. Therefore the answer to Question 1 must be in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Question 3 and Question 4 relate to procedure for the appellant as the landowner to challenge the decision of the Land Administrator in the acquisition exercise involving its land. This relates to an application for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the RHC 1980</LINK> (now the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;;">ROC 2012</LINK>). The issue to be determined is when does the 40 days period as stipulated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> (the relevant rules applicable at the material time) starts to run. The appellant is contending that the time frame should run from the date of service of Form H on the appellant; while the respondents on the other hand are contending that it should run from the date of publication of Form D in the gazette.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> At the <i>inter parte</i> hearing of the substantive application for judicial review (after leave was earlier granted <i>ex parte</i> 20 May 2008), the 2nd respondent raised preliminary objections on two points, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The High Court Judge after hearing submissions on the objections, did not deal with the two preliminary points raised. Instead the learned judge proceeded to hear the substantive arguments on merit and later dismissed the judicial review application on merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> At the Court of Appeal, the 2nd respondent raised the same preliminary objections on the two points. This was supported by the State Legal Advisor who appeared for the 1st respondent. The Court of Appeal heard all parties and upheld the preliminary objections and thereafter ruled in favour of the respondents. Thus, on these grounds alone, the Court of Appeal held that the judicial review proceedings were fatally flawed and ought to be dismissed <i>in limine</i>. The appellant's appeal was therefore unanimously dismissed without hearing or considering the merits of the substantive appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> According to the appellant's counsel, the brief oral grounds given by the Court of Appeal in relation to the 1st objections, are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The Court of Appeal further ruled: "The publication in the gazette is a public notice to all persons: see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18 Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 (Consolidated and Revised 1989) (Act 338)</LINK>. This is the operative provision with regard the notification of the decision to acquire for a public purpose."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Judicial review application was at the relevant time governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the RHC 1980</LINK> (now the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;;">Rules of Court 2012</LINK>). <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> provides that an application for judicial review shall be made promptly, and in any event, within 40 days from the date when the grounds for the application first arose or when the decision is first communicated to the applicant. In relation to matters relating to land acquisition under the LAA, an applicant can only exercise his right to apply for judicial review when the decision which he intends to challenge is communicated to him. In other words, the decision must have been brought to his actual notice or knowledge in order for him to prepare his case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In order to bring <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> into play, it is crucial to first identify what the decision that is sought to be impugned or challenged by the applicant in the judicial review proceedings. (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_390;"><i>Abdul Rahman Abdullah Munir &amp; Ors v. Datuk Bandar Kuala Lumpur &amp; Anor</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 390</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 704; [2008] 6 CLJ 805, Court of Appeal). For that matter, the court must refer to the application for leave for judicial review made by the applicant. In the present case, the application for leave was made <i>ex parte</i> on 6 January 2008, supported by an affidavit affirmed by one Tan Sri Dato' Alwi Jantan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Prayer 1 of the said leave application prays to an order of <i>certiorari</i> to set aside the decision of the 1st respondent to acquire part of the applicant's land known as Lot 3168, Mukim Kijal, Daerah Kemaman, in the State of Terengganu, which was published in the government gazette dated 21 July 2005. Close examination of the statements as found in the affidavit-in-support of the leave application show that the appellant's grievance was not so much on the award of compensation but on the acquisition of the land in question. The objection by the appellant at all material times was in respect of the acquisition of its land, not the quantum of the award made by the Land Administrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> When was the said decision to acquire the land first communicated to the appellant? The word "communicate" is not expressly defined in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;;">RHC 1980</LINK>. It is also not expressly defined in the LAA. The <i>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</i> defines "communicate" as "to make something known to somebody"; "to pass something on; to transmit something"; "to make one's idea, feelings, etc clear to others". In the <i>Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners</i> (New Edition), the word 'communicate' is explained as "to express thoughts, feelings, or information to another person ... for example by speaking or writing"; "to let someone knew what you are feeling or thinking." It is further explained as follows "when people communicate; it is as if their thoughts and ideas travel between one person and the other; or are sent from one person to another."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In the case of <i>Sh Gurbachan Singh v. SM Jagiro</i> [1956] AIR Vol 43, Punjab Section, p 254, Bhandari CJ, ruled that the expression 'communicate' is not synonymous with the expression "publish" which mean "to make public". It means "to bestow convey make known, recount, to import as to communicate information to anyone".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In that case, the validity of an order of a second class Magistrate dated 22 January 1955 (made under s 488 of the Indian CPC) was challenged on the ground that the learned Magistrate did not exercise the powers of a Magistrate of a first class on 22 January 1955 as a copy of the notification by which the Magistrate was invested with the powers of a Magistrate of the first class, though dated 3 January 1955, was only sent to him on 8 February 1955 and published in the local official gazette on 18 February 1955. The relevant rule, (ie s 39(2) of the Indian CPC) declares that an order conferring Magisterial powers on a person "shall take effect on the day on which it is communicated to the person concerned".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The court held that as the order investing the Magistrate with powers of a first class Magistrate was not communicated to him till 8 February 1955 and as he did not exercise the powers of a first class before that date, it was not within his competence to make an order under s 488 of the CPC on 22 January 1955; the order under s 488 was therefore void and set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The clear indication in the above case is that "the day on which it is communicated to the person concerned" as stipulated in the relevant s 39(2) of the Indian CPC, refers to the day when a copy of the notification was actually sent to the Magistrate concerned on 8 February 1955, but not the day when the said notification was issued on 3 January 1955, nor the day when it was published in the official gazette on 18 February 1955.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The above decision is clearly in line with the literal meaning of the word "communicate" as defined in the various dictionaries cited above. On the presumption that the legislature does nothing in vain, the court must endeavor to give significance to every word of the law legislated and it is presumed that if a word or phrase appears in a legislation, it was put there for a purpose and must not be disregarded. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_52;"><i>Foo Loke Ying &amp; Anor v. Television Broadcasts Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 52</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 35; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 122, <i>Quebec Railway, Light, Heat and Power Co Ltd v. Vandry</i> [1920] AC 662 and <i>Enmore Estates Ltd v. Darsan</i> [1970] AC 497, 506).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Abdoolcader SCJ in <i>Foo Loke Ying (supra)</i> had made a very interesting observation on this issue when His Lordship said:</p>

      <b>[42]</b> In order to determine the issue before us in the present appeal, the words "the date when the decision is first communicated to the applicant" as found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> must be read together or in the context of the relevant provisions of the LAA relating to land acquisition proceedings. All those relevant provisions must be interpreted based on "a purposive and literal construction which is one which follows the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose and applies where the literal meaning is clear and reflects the purposes of the enactment."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> It is perhaps necessary to refer to some relevant provisions of the LAA and the relevant forms issued relating to land acquisition proceedings under the said Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> When the State Authority decides that lands are needed for public purposes, a declaration of intended acquisition in Form D, may be issued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8 of the LAA</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Form D is a declaration of an intended acquisition of land required for a public purpose. The list of lands referred to in Form C must be included as a schedule to Form D. The declaration shall lapse and cease to be of any effect on the expiry of two years after the date of its publication in the gazette in so far as it relates to any land in respect of which the Land Administrator has not made an award in respect of each person whose interest in the land has been established in an enquiry under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14 of the Act</LINK>. Where the declaration has lapsed, all proceedings already taken or being taken in consequence of such declaration in respect of such land shall terminate and be of no effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Form D needs to be published in the gazette. There is no requirement that it must be served on anybody (otherwise than by notification in the gazette).</p>

      <b>[47]</b> The actual commencement of proceedings for land acquisition is by giving public notice in Form E under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10 of the LAA</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">Section 10</LINK> provides:</p>

      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">Section 10(1) of the LAA</LINK> clearly stipulates that "the Land Administrator shall ... commence proceedings for the acquisition of the land by giving public notice in Form E in the manner prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">s 52</LINK> ...", ie by causing copies of such notification declaration or document to be posted at the District Land Office, on public notice boards in the mukim or township in which the land is situated and in such other places on or near the land in question as the Land Administrator may think fit. There is no indication in the LAA that Form E must be published in the gazette.</p>

    <p>This requirement is "in addition to giving public notice as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(1)</LINK>". It is a mandatory requirement for the Land Administrator to commence proceedings for the acquisition of lands under the LAA.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[51]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">Section 53</LINK> stresses on strict compliance of service of notices or other documents relating to land acquisition upon the occupier or registered proprietor as well as person having a registered interest in such land. Those notices or documents, duly signed by the Land Administor must be delivered or tendered a copy thereof to the person to whom the notice is addressed or, if he cannot be found, to any adult member of his family residing with him. The signature of the person to whom such copy is delivered or tendered must be obtained and endorsed upon the original document or an office copy thereof; and such endorsement must be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> In the event that service of the notice or document cannot be done effectively under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">s 53</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">s 54 of the Act</LINK> provides that the Land Administrator must proceed to effect service upon an agent authorised to receive service on behalf of the party or upon a person entitled to act for such party, or where there is no such agent or person entitled to act within the state, effect service by sending the notice by registered post to the party if after reasonable inquiry, his address can be ascertained, and where he considers that publication in a newspaper is desirable, publish the notice in such local newspaper circulating in the State as he thinks fit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The clear indication of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">s 11</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">s 53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">s 54 of the LAA</LINK> is that Form E, the relevant document to commence proceedings for land acquisition under the Act together with a copy of the schedule to the declaration in Form D, must effectively be delivered and communicated to the interested persons, particularly the occupier or the registered proprietor of such land. The relevant notice and information relating to the acquisition must be brought to the actual knowledge of the persons concerned; and sufficient proof acknowledging the service of the documents by the person to whom such documents are delivered must be obtained and entered in an official book to be kept for that purpose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> With the comprehensive and elaborate provisions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 of the LAA</LINK>, we can safely conclude that a mere publication in the gazette of a notification or declaration in Form D under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the same Act</LINK> is clearly insufficient for the purpose of communicating the decision relating to the land acquisition to the interested persons concerned. Our view is that for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>, Form E of the LAA which commences proceedings for the acquisition of land together with the schedule attached thereto, and served on the interested persons in the manner prescribed by the relevant express specific provisions in the LAA, can be construed as the first communication to the appellant, being the registered proprietor of the land in question, of the decision by the State Authority to acquire its land in question. This interpretation is in line with the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 (Act 338)</LINK> which provides that: "in the interpretation of the provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The Court of Appeal in the present case relied on the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1) of the LAA</LINK> read together within <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> in coming to its conclusion that the date when the said decision was first communicated to the appellant was when the declaration in Form D was published in the gazette; and therefore the 40 days' time frame as stipulated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> starts to run from such date of publication.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Our view is that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> is a general provision applicable to interpretation of all relevant written laws. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;18.;;">s 18(2)</LINK>, publication in the official gazette shall constitute sufficient notice of any matter required to be published in the gazette by or under any federal law; whereas <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 of the LAA</LINK> are specific provisions in the LAA specifically to impress that the notification in Form E thereunder must necessarily be served or communicated to the interested persons who are likely to be affected by the land acquisition in question, in the manner prescribed thereunder. The words "constitute sufficient notice of any matter required to be published in the gazette by or under any federal law..." cannot override the effect of those relevant sections in the LAA. It cannot be construed that by the publication in the gazette, the State Authority had "communicated" the said notification or declaration to the appellant for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. Giving effect to the relevant sections in the LAA, as discussed above, the said notification or declaration was only "first communicated" to the appellant when Form E was served on or delivered to it on 7 March 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> It is a well-known rule of construction that specific provision overrides general provision. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_222;"><i>Lee Lian &amp; Ors v.

      <b>[58]</b> The relevant specific provisions in the LAA must be given effect in interpreting the issue of service or communication of the notification or declaration to the interested persons in matters relating to land acquisition in the Act.

      <b>[59]</b> By the acquisitions of the land, the appellant was deprived of its right to own the property. As such it would only be just and fair that the decision to acquire the lands be brought to the appellant's actual knowledge by way of communicating the same to the appellant. The rights of a citizen to property under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> could only be deprived in accordance with law and that an actual or express notice (as opposed to a constructive notice by way of a gazette) of such deprivation ought to have been given to the citizen. The appellant cannot be expected to apply for leave to commence judicial review to challenge the deprivation of its rights to the property unless it has knowledge or is made aware of such deprivation and this could only happen when the appellant is served with the actual or express notice that its right has been infringed. The first written notice (in the form of Form E) required to be issued and served on the appellant, as registered proprietor of the said lands, under the LAA is Form E issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10(1) of the Act</LINK>.</p>

The learned High Court Judge found that the application was made more than 11 years from the time the first decision was made known to the public, and more than one year from the time it was communicated to the appellant. The learned High Court Judge found the applicants had actual knowledge of the approval of the EIA Report as of 8 January 2007, a period in excess of one year prior to the institution of the application for leave under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[65]</b> In <i>Abdul Rahman Abdullah Munir &amp; Ors v. Datuk Bandar Kuala Lumpur &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, the Court of Appeal held that for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>, time started to run against the appellants when the appellants first knew of the decision on 8 November 2003 when their representative met with the planning officer of the DBKL. It seems to suggest that the meeting with the representative of the DBKL evidenced that the appellants had actual knowledge of the said decision. However, the Court of Appeal held that "taking 8 November 2003 as the latest date the decision was communicated, calculated to 14 February 2005, ie the date of filing this application for the judicial review there clearly had been inordinate delay in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC</LINK>."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> We are of the view that an application for leave for judicial review made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> challenging the decision of the State Authority declaring that the land is to be acquired under the LAA, must be filed within 40 days from the date when the decision was first communicated to the applicant ie on the date when the notice of enquiry in Form E which appended a copy of the schedule to Form D was served pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;10.;;">s 10 of the LAA</LINK> on the registered proprietor or occupier of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;11.;;">ss 11</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;52.;;">52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;53.;;">53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;54.;;">54 of the LAA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> In the present case before us, Form E was served on the appellant on 7 March 2006. Application for leave for judicial review was filed on 6 January 2008, ie almost 22 months after Form E was served on the appellant; or in other words, 22 months after the decision to acquire the land in question was first communicated to the appellant. This is clearly a beyond the 40 days time frame as stipulated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. There had been inordinate delay on the part of the appellant in filing for judicial review. There is no indication to show that the appellant had applied for an extension of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Form H cannot be the starting point to calculate when the 40 days time frame under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> starts to run as contended by the appellant. Form H is issued based on the award by the Land Administrator under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(1) of the Act</LINK>. It includes an extract from the written award of the Land Administrator in Form G. It is a notice of award and offer of compensation in respect of the land acquired. It does not convey the decision of the State Authority to acquire the land (which forms the subject matter of the judicial review). The said decision was earlier conveyed to the appellant vide Form E with the schedule appended to it, which the appellant had earlier received on 7 March 2006. It was through Form E with the schedule that the decision of the State Authority to acquire the land was "first communicated" to the appellant as the registered owner of the land in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 of the RHC 1980</LINK> sets out a specific procedure for an applicant to comply with in order to enable him to invoke the judicial review proceedings. When such explicit procedure is created, then as a general rule all applicants for such relief must adhere to the procedure, failing which the application would not be entertained by the court. In the present case, there was clear noncompliance by the appellant with the imperative requirement of time set under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> It is trite law, that strict compliance with the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> is mandatory. The mandatory nature of the requirements is clearly reflected in the usage of the word "shall" therein, which means that there can be no exceptions unless an extension of time has been applied for and obtained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> A prompt action to apply for a judicial review is therefore necessary, for non-compliance with the requirement, as to the time frame to file the application would result in the court not having jurisdiction to hear the application right from beginning. The Court of Appeal in the case of <i>Abdul Rahman Abdullah Munir &amp; Ors v. Datuk Bandar Kuala Lumpur &amp; Anor (supra)</i> had correctly ruled that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> In that case, the Court of Appeal concluded that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Applying the same principle to the facts of the present case, we are of the view that the High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the appellant's application for judicial review on the ground that the time frame of 40 days under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> has not been complied with. On this ground alone, we are in agreement with the Court of Appeal that the respondent's 1st objection must be upheld and the judicial review application by the appellant ought to be dismissed <i>in limine</i>; and consequently, the appellant's appeal before us must also be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> In view of the above findings, there is no necessity for this court to consider the 2nd objection that the proper party was not named as the 1st respondent. There is also no necessity to go into the merit of the judicial review application. As has been clearly said by Hashim Yeop Sani FJ in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_231;"><i>Ravindran P Muthukrishnan v. Malaysian Examinations Council</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 231</LINK>; [1984] 1 MLJ 168; [1984] 1 CLJ 320: "Since the judge rejected the explanation for the delay it follows that the court had no-jurisdiction to hear the application for leave for an order of <i>certiorari</i> ... whether the application for an order of<i> certiorari </i>had merits or not was irrelevant."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> Question 5 and Question 6 relate to the appellant's complaint that preliminary objections by the respondents should not be made at the hearing of the appeal at the Court of Appeal when leave to commence judicial review had been granted and the substantive judicial review application had been disposed of by the High Court. The appellant argued that the preliminary objections should have been raised at the leave stage at the High Court and the respondents are barred and estopped from raising such preliminary objections. The appellant further contended that the 1st respondent had conceded to such leave being granted by the High Court; and therefore is deemed to have waived its rights to make any preliminary objection in the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> We cannot agree with the appellant on this point. At the leave stage, the application was made by the appellant <i>ex parte</i>. Both the 1st and 2nd respondents were not present in court as they were not served yet with all the relevant documents. Obviously, the respondents cannot be expected to raise any preliminary objection at the leave stage. Therefore, the question that the respondents were barred and estopped from raising such preliminary objections after leave has been granted does not arise. The first appearance by both the respondents in the application was when the application proper was heard <i>inter parte</i>. That is the first and the earliest opportunity for them to appear and to raise the preliminary objections. There is nothing irregular about that.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> The appellant contended that the 1st respondent had conceded to such leave being granted by the High Court and therefore, the 1st respondent is deemed to have waived its right to make any preliminary objection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> In the present case the 1st respondent is Pentadbir Tanah, Kemaman; and the 2nd respondent is a company known as Maju Timor Sdn Bhd. The 1st respondent is represented by the State Legal Advisor of Terengganu, while the 2nd respondent is represented by a private lawyer. It is not disputed that neither of them was present in court at the hearing of the application for leave. Besides the appellant's counsel, an officer from the Attorney General's Chambers was present in court at the hearing for leave. His presence in court was based on the notice given by the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(2) of the RHC 1980</LINK> which requires that: "The applicant must give notice of the hearing of the application for leave not later than three days before the hearing date to the Attorney General's Chambers and must at the same time lodge in those Chambers copies of the statement and affidavits."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> The presence of the officer from the Attorney General's Chambers throughout the proceeding does not mean that he was representing the 1st respondent particularly when the application for leave was made <i>ex parte</i>. This issue was clearly explained by Abdul Kadir Sulaiman J in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_2_635;"><i>Chow Hong Lit lwn. YB Menteri Sumber Manusia Malaysia &amp; Satu Lagi</i> [1998] 2 MLRH 635</LINK>; [1998] 3 MLJ 63; [1998] 5 CLJ 169 in the following passage:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> The position is thus clear that the officer from the Attorney General's Chambers who attended court at the leave stage did not represent the 1st respondent, nor the 2nd respondent. Therefore both the 1st and 2nd respondents cannot be barred and estopped from raising the preliminary objections at the <i>inter parte</i> hearing of the substantive application after leave had been granted. The question whether they had waived their rights to raise the preliminary objections does not arise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> The 1st preliminary objection under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> relates to the question jurisdiction of the court. If the objection is allowed, then the High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the judicial review application and leave should not have been granted in the first place. Consequently, the High Court should not have proceeded to hear the substantive application on merit. In the present case, the High Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave as prayed for by the appellant as it is the cardinal principle of law that the court cannot confer jurisdiction upon itself when none exist. Appeals to the Court of Appeal shall be by way of rehearing; and in relation to such appeals, the Court of Appeal shall have all the powers and duties of the High Court. At the appeal stage, the "Court of Appeal may draw inferences of fact, and give any judgment, and make any order which ought to have been given or made and make such further orders as the case requires." (See: <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;69.;;">s 69(4) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>; see also: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_4_479;"><i>Ruslan Baharin Industries Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Kerajaan Malaysia</i> [2009] 4 MLRA 479</LINK>; [2009] 5 MLJ 63; [2010] 7 CLJ 713).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> Therefore, the respondents are at liberty to raise the preliminary objections when the case came up for appeal at the Court of Appeal particularly when the High Court Judge failed to consider their objections earlier. There is no legal impediment for that. The Court of Appeal was right in hearing the preliminary objections and subsequently dismissing the appeal after allowing the objections.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> The preliminary objections were first raised in the High Court. Thereafter, at the Court of Appeal, written submissions were filed in advance of the hearing of the appeal as well as the preliminary objections. Then, the hearing of the appeal was adjourned to another date to enable counsel for the appellant to be prepared to argue the preliminary objections. Therefore, it is not correct for the appellant to say that they were not given prior notice on the preliminary objections raised at the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> In the result, for all the reasons given above, we hold that the judicial review application by the appellant was filed outside the stipulated 40 days time frame provided for by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6) of the RHC 1980</LINK> (the applicable provisions then). The 40 days period started to run from the date when the decision of the State Authority to acquire the appellant's land in question was first communicated to the appellant when Form E together with the schedule attached thereto was served on the appellant on 7 March 2006. Since the judicial review application was only filed by the appellant on 6 January 2008, it was clearly outside the stipulated 40 days period. Therefore, the High Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave and to hear the substantive judicial review applications; and the application must be dismissed <i>in limine</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> Therefore, the first preliminary objection is allowed and upheld. It is not necessary to deal with the 2nd preliminary objection and the merits of the substantive application. We have also dealt with all the questions posed before us for determination in this judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> We, therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> The facts disclosed in the statement and affidavits filed in support of the application, and that filed by the respondents in opposition to the application, are these.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> The appellant is the registered owner of Lot PT No 3168, Mukim Kijal, Daerah Kemaman Negeri Terengganu. Maju Timor Sdn Bhd (the 2nd respondent in the High Court as well as in this appeal, subsequently referred to as "MTSB") is the owner of an adjacent land, ie Lot 33 Mukim Kijal, Daerah Kemaman, Negeri Terengganu.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK>, a Notice of Intended Acquisition in Form D, <i>inter alia</i>, of part of the appellant's land was issued by the Pentadbir Tanah Kemaman (the 1st respondent in the High Court as well as in this appeal, subsequently referred to as "the Land Administrator") for the public purpose of "Laluan Jalan Pantai Beris, Meraga, Mukim Kijal, Daerah Kemaman". This Form D was published in Warta Kerajaan Negeri vide Gazette No 469 on 21 July 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> Thereafter, pursuant to ss 10 and 11, the Land Administrator issued a notice in the prescribed Form E dated 28 February 2006 by which notice the appellant was informed that an enquiry would be held on 27 March 2006 at the Land Office Kemaman for the purpose of determining persons who has an interest in the lands to be acquired as specified in the schedule annexed thereto, as well as the amount of compensation to be awarded arising from the said acquisition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> The Form E issued by the Land Administrator was served on the appellant on 7 March 2006. It is common ground that the Form E served on the appellant did not append the gazetted Form D, (ie the Notice of Intended Acquisition) which had earlier been issued by the Land Administrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> It is not in issue that the appellant's representative was present at the enquiry before the Land Administrator on the date of hearing of 28 May 2006. It is also common ground that the appellant had objected to the acquisition of part of its land by the State Authority and had applied to the Menteri Besar Trengganu for a stay of the said acquisition. The appellant entertained suspicions that the acquisition exercise of part of its land was not for the declared public purpose held out in the gazetted Form D but rather, for the sole benefit of MTSB. It is also common ground that the hearing before the Land Administrator was adjourned several times on the application of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> After several adjournments the Land Administrator proceeded with the hearing of the enquiry. At the conclusion of the enquiry on 3 August 2006, the Land Administrator made a written award in terms of Form G addressed to the three land owners (<i>inter alia</i>, the appellant) affected by the acquisition exercise pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(1)</LINK>. A separate award was made by the Land Administrator for each affected area. This Form G had since been filed in the office of the Land Administrator pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(2)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> On 27 November 2007 the appellant was served with a Notice of Award and Compensation in terms of the prescribed Form H issued by the Land Administrator pursuant to the power conferred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;16.;;">s 16</LINK>. The appellant did not accept the sum awarded by the Land Administrator as compensation. The appellant gave notice in the Form H served upon them of its intention to challenge the said acquisition. The appellant did not, on the facts of this case, file an appeal in respect of the award made by the Land Administrator by filing the prescribed Form N pursuant to the remedy provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;38.;;">s 38</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> On 6 January 2008, the appellant filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review pursuant to O 53 at High Court Kuala Terengganu, ie Originating Summons No: 13-01-2008 citing the Land Administrator, Pentadbir Tanah Kemaman, as the 1st respondent, and MTSB, another land owner, affected by the acquisition exercise, the company whom the appellant alleged the acquisition exercise was in favour of.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> A copy of the appellant's application for leave to apply for judicial review was then served on the Attorney General pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>. By reason of the application being an <i>ex parte</i> one, the appellant did not serve a copy of the leave application and documents filed in support of the application on the putative respondents, the Land Administrator and MTSB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> At the hearing of the <i>ex parte</i> application for leave a Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) appeared on behalf of the Attorney General. The SFC did not object to the appellant's application for leave. The court duly granted leave for the appellant to apply for judicial review on 20 May 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> Having obtained leave, the appellant then, on 1 June 2008, filed its substantive application for judicial review as well as statement and affidavits in support of the application. The documents filed in respect of the substantive application was then served on the named respondents, the Land Administrator and MTSB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> At the <i>inter partes</i> hearing of the substantive application MTSB raised two preliminary objections, ie firstly, it was alleged that the appellant had not complied with the time frame prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>; secondly, the appellant had failed to cite the proper party, (ie the State Authority) to the application. By reason of these non-compliance, MTSB contended that the appellant's application should be dismissed <i>in limine</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[101]</b> After hearing the submissions of the respective parties the learned High Court Judge on 21 June 2009 dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the decision of the High Court. In his judgment dated 27 December 2011 the learned judge made no mention of the preliminary objections raised by MTSB but instead dealt with the application on its merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[102]</b> At the hearing of the appellant's appeal against the High Court decision before the Court of Appeal, besides responding to the substantive issues in their submissions, MTSB raised the same preliminary objections which had earlier been raised in the High Court, which objections was supported by the State Legal Adviser Terengganu who appeared for the Land Administrator. The Court of Appeal adjourned the hearing of the appeal to enable the appellant to respond and submit on the preliminary objections raised by the respondents. On 1 August 2012 the Court of Appeal upheld the respondents preliminary objections. The appellant's appeal was then dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[103]</b> In its judgment the Court of Appeal took note of the fact from the statement and supporting affidavit that the appellant's grievance was not so much with the award itself but the against the acquisition itself. That the objection by the appellant was in respect of the acquisition of part of its land, not against the quantum of the award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[104]</b> On the objection of the State Authority not being cited as a party the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[105]</b> On the issue when the 40 days prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> was to be computed, the Court of Appeal in its judgment held the 40 days prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> runs from publication of the State Authority's decision vide the Form D in the gazette and not the service of Form H by the Land Administrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[106]</b> The Court of Appeal then ruled that the two year time frame in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;16.;;">s 16</LINK> applied to the making of the award in Form G under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(1)</LINK>, and not the giving of notice in Form H. The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_3_444;"><i>Arthur Ponniah Gurubatham &amp; Satu Lagi lwn. Pentadbir Tanah Wilayah Persekutuan</i> [2007] 3 MLRH 444</LINK>; [2008] 3 CLJ 17 was relied upon as authority for this ruling. As the award in Form G was made on 3 August 2006, the Court of Appeal ruled that the Land Administrator had acted well within the two years time frame, which commenced from the date of the gazetting of Form D, ie on 21 July 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[107]</b> The Court of Appeal ruled that the application for leave was, on the facts of this case, not filed within the prescribed time prescribed by the rules. There was no reasons advanced by the appellant warranting the exercise of the court's discretion to grant an extension of time in the appellant's favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[108]</b> On 30 July 2013, the Federal Court granted the appellant leave to appeal on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellants' Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[109]</b> It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the learned judge erred in law and in fact in failing to take into consideration the failure by the Land Administrator to make and serve an award in Form H on the appellant within two years after Form D was gazetted. According to the appellant's Counsel this was contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4)</LINK> and renders the Form D Declaration of Intended Acquisition published in the gazette on 21 July 2005 to lapse, cease, terminate and of no effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[110]</b> The fact that Form H was served on the appellant on 27 November 2007 was highlighted, as well as the fact that the application for leave to apply judicial review was filed by the appellant only on 6 January 2008. The appellant's Counsel submitted there was no delay in filing the leave application for judicial review as it was filed within forty days of service of Form H upon them. It was the appellant's case that there was no necessity for the appellant to apply for an extension of time as the application had been filed within forty days of service of Form H upon the appellant, (ie 27 November 2007), which was the date when the forty days start to run.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[111]</b> On the objection as to whether the proper party had been cited in the application, the appellant's complaint in this case was against the decision of the Land Administrator in issuing Form H. The Land Administrator was therefore rightly named as a party to the application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The State Legal Adviser's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[112]</b> The State Legal Adviser submitted that the "decision" to acquire the lands pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;3.;;">s 3(1)(a)</LINK> was a decision of the Terengganu State Government (Pihak Berkuasa Negeri) who had not been named as a party to the proceedings. The decision which was being challenged was clearly that of the State Authority, not that of the Land Administrator. The Form D exhibited was signed by the Terengganu State Director of Lands and Mines, not the Land Administrator. The Land Administrator was but only carrying out his statutory duties pursuant to the power conferred by the Act consequential upon the decision of the State Authority to acquire the lands specified in the gazetted Form D.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[113]</b> As to when time runs for the purpose of computing the period prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK>, the State Legal Adviser submitted that time runs from the date of publication of Form D in the gazette, (ie 21 July 2005) and not the service of Form H on the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[114]</b> As to the publication of the decision of the State Authority in the gazette as a mode of communication of such a decision, reference was made to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_582;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Koo Cheh Yew &amp; Anor</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 582</LINK>; [1980] 2 MLJ 235 where the Federal Court, in discussing the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Interpretation Acts</LINK> at p 589, held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[115]</b> The respondent Counsel submitted that the operative provision with regard to the gazetting of the State Authority's decision of Notice of Intended Acquisition to acquire land for a public purpose was clearly <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8</LINK>. The publication in the gazette of the State Authority's decision of Intended Acquisition was a public notice to all persons, including the appellant, who is the registered proprietor of part of the lands to be acquired.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[116]</b> The Declaration of the Intended Acquisition of part of the appellant's land in Form D was gazetted on 21 July 2005. The application for judicial review was filed on 6 January 2008. Computing the 40 days from the date of the gazette notification of Form D, the leave application was clearly filed years beyond the prescribed 40 days period in O 53 r 3(6).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[117]</b> Questions (a) and (b) will be considered together and can be answered shortly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[118]</b> The putative respondents were not present at the hearing of the application at leave stage as at that point in time, by reason of the application being an <i>ex parte</i> one, it was not served on the putative respondents. The respondents, not having been served with the <i>ex parte</i> leave application, were of course not present at the hearing of the leave application and accordingly, not in a position to raise any preliminary objection at that stage of the proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[119]</b> Clearly the fact that the SFC did not object to leave being granted for the appellant to file the application for judicial review, did not, in my considered opinion, estop any of the respondents from raising the preliminary objections before the High Court Judge, at the <i>inter partes</i> hearing of the substantive application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[120]</b> Upon close scrutiny of the judgment of the High Court, it is clear that he dealt with the appellant's application on its merits. No ruling was made by the learned High Court Judge on the preliminary objections raised by MTSB. Upon examination of the Court of Appeal's judgment, it would appear that the Court of Appeal was not right in stating that rulings were made by the High Court Judge on the preliminary objections raised by MTSB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[121]</b> Was it then open for both of the respondents to raise the same preliminary objections at the hearing of the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court before the Court of Appeal? Was the Court of Appeal then right in entertaining the preliminary objections by the respondents at the appellate stage?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[122]</b> On this issue I am of the following view. The Court of Appeal was certainly right and had the jurisdiction to do so. Decisions of this apex court had throughout the years consistently held that compliance with the time frame prescribed in the rules was fundamental as it goes to jurisdiction. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_117;"><i>Mersing Omnibus Co Sdn Bhd v. The Minister Of Labour &amp; Manpower &amp; Anor</i> [1983] 1 MLRA 117</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 54; [1983] CLJ (Rep) 266, where the appellant was out of time and had not sought an extension of time nor accounted for the delay, the Federal Court had, on its own motion, raised the issue of the application being filed out of time and held that leave should not have been granted. The judgment of the Federal Court on this issue states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[123]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_231;"><i>Ravindran P Muthukrishnan v. Malaysian Examinations Council</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 231</LINK>; [1984] 1 MLJ 168; [1984] 1 CLJ 320 the Federal Court held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[124]</b> The cases of <i>Mersing Omnibus</i> and <i>Ravindran</i> was referred by the Federal Court recently in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_3_525;"><i>Wong Kin Hoong &amp; Anor v. Ketua Pengarah Jabatan Alam Sekitar &amp; Anor</i> [2013] 3 MLRA 525</LINK>; [2013] 4 MLJ 161; [2013] 4 CLJ 193; [2013] 4 AMR 211 where the Federal Court arrived at the same conclusion when it held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[125]</b> Applying the above principles to the facts of this case in determining whether the leave application filed by the appellant was within the time frame provided by the rules, an aggrieved person is required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> to act "promptly", and in any event, not later than forty days from "the date when the grounds for the application first arose" or "when the decision is first communicated" to the appellant. The intention of the rules in limiting a prescribed period must necessarily be construed to mean that it is the public interest that an aggrieved person's right of access to the court has to yield to the need for a swift finality of the decision in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[126]</b> In respect of an acquisition of land situation, when a notice is given under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK>, the State Authority is obliged to specify the particular land and areas intended to be acquired.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[127]</b> It is for this purpose that a plan of the particular lands and areas so specified is prepared and kept so that the public can inspect the plan during normal office hours at the Land Office and the District Office of the area in which the said lands are situated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[128]</b> An award in Form G pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">s 14(1)</LINK> made by the Land Administrator when filed, "shall be final and conclusive evidence of the area of the scheduled land, of its value in the opinion of the Land Administrator, and of the apportionment of the compensation awarded, whether the persons interested have or have not appeared at the enquiry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[129]</b> The main thrust of the appellant's case rests on s 8(4) which provision was inserted into <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8</LINK> vide the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_AMEN_1984_575;;">Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 1984 (Act A 575)</LINK> with effect from 20 January 1984. According to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(4)</LINK>, a declaration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK> shall lapse and cease to be of any effect on the expiry of two years after the date of its publication in the gazette in respect of which the Land Administrator has not made an award under subsection <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;14.;;">14(1)</LINK> within a period of two years. In such a situation all proceedings already taken or being taken in consequence of such a declaration in respect of such land or such part of the land shall terminate and be of no effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[130]</b> The critical issue in the questions posed is, when does the "40 days" as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK> start to run for the purpose of ascertaining whether the appellant had acted "promptly" from the date when the grounds for the application first arose or "when the decision is first communicated" to the appellant. Does it run:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[131]</b> In the earlier part of this judgment I have stated my agreement with the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the impugned decision was a decision made by the State Authority, not the decision made by the Land Administrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[132]</b> As to when the State Authority's decision of intention to acquire part of the appellant's land was "first communicated" to the appellant, I am in agreement with the submission of the respondents. The operative provision which governs the mode of communication of such a decision is clearly <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8(1)</LINK> is the operative provision with regard to the notification of the State Authority's decision of its intention to acquire which land, or part of land and for what purpose. In respect of an acquisition of land the publication of such an intention in the gazette in terms of the Form D affords the public, and the appellant in particular, the most practical and sensible way in which to give notice of the State Authority's intended acquisition. Giving the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">s 8(1)</LINK> its plain and ordinary meaning, the intention of the Legislature presumes that the notice of the public has been sufficiently drawn to the acquisition by way of publication in the gazette. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;8.;;">Section 8(1)</LINK> establish positively and as a fact that this acquisition is to the knowledge of the appellant. I am of the view that if the law fixes the public with knowledge, and deems such knowledge to be a fact, this court must necessarily give effect to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[133]</b> I am further of the view that the Court of Appeal was right in ruling that the filing of the application for leave to apply judicial review for an order of<i> certiorari </i>must be filed within forty days of the publication of Form D in the gazette and not the service of Form H. In this case the Form D Declaration of the Intended Acquisition was gazetted on 21 July 2005. The leave application was filed 6 January 2008. The appellant had clearly not acted "promptly" nor within forty days prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>. The application clearly was filed years beyond the time frame prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(6)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[134]</b> The Court of Appeal was in my view also right in stating that the law relating to extension of time for judicial review was clear. The appellant had not applied for an extension of time and given no reason for delay. There was thus no basis warranting the court to exercise its discretionary power to extend time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[135]</b> In conclusion, on my part, I would answer the first limb of question (a) in the affirmative. The 2nd limb of questions (a) and (b) need not be answered. These questions do not arise as the Land Administrator was not present at the hearing of the <i>ex parte</i> leave application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[136]</b> On the questions posed in paras (c) (d), (e) and (f), I am of the view there is also no necessity to answer these questions in view of my finding that the Court of Appeal was right in ruling that the challenge was against the decision of the State Authority to acquire part of the appellant's land, and not the quantum made by the Land Administrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[137]</b> For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
