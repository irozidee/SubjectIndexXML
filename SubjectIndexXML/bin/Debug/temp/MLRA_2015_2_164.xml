    <p>The appellant was the Speaker of the 12th State Legislative Assembly of Selangor while the 1st respondent was the assemblyman for the Port Klang constituency in the State of Selangor. The appellant appealed against the decision of the learned judge allowing the 1st respondent's originating summons ('OS') for declarations, amongst others, that he (the 1st respondent) was the State Legislative Assemblyman for Port Klang and that the declaration by the appellant that the Port Klang seat twas vacant was <i>ultra vires</i> art 69 of the Constitution of the State of Selangor ('CSS'). The appellant also appealed against the learned judge's dismissal of his application to strike out the 1st respondent's OS, which was based on the ground that the matter was not justiciable and that he had immunity under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1957_000;72.;;">art 72 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> ('FC') and paras 2 and 3 to the Schedule to art 77 of the CSS. There were two main issues before the court: (i) whether the learned judge erred in refusing to adjourn the hearing of the appellant's setting aside application; and (ii) whether the judgment of the learned judge in allowing the respondent's OS was a judgment in default as opposed to a judgment on merits allowing the appellant's application to set it aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The date for the hearing of the respondent's OS was fixed without the consent of the appellant's counsel. The Deputy Registrar did not record the minutes of the case management accurately to reflect that the appellant's counsel could not be contacted during the short adjournment that was made and that the junior counsel who stood on his behalf was unable to obtain any instruction from him. The right of a litigant to engage counsel of his choice should not be taken lightly albeit such counsel of choice must not abuse his right by not attending the hearing on the date he had agreed to. (paras 24-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The hearing was heard without the benefit of full submissions from the appellant's counsel bearing in mind that it related to an interpretation of the Federal and State Constitutions in the context of the power of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in declaring a State seat vacant. It was very much a public interest matter. Justice would have been better served if the learned judge had adjourned the hearing to another date to give the appellant's counsel a chance to reply what had been submitted by the 1st respondent's counsel. There was no prejudice to either party if that course of action was taken. The presence of the appellant's junior counsel did not legitimise the hearing. In the circumstances, the orders of the court that followed should be set aside and the matter remitted for retrial on merits. However, as the issues were determined by the High Court by way of affidavits and on the undisputed factual matrix, this court was entitled to proceed to consider the merits of the appeal. (paras 27-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;72.;;">Article 72 of the FC</LINK> and art 75 of the CSS provide that decisions made during proceedings in the State Assembly were not subject to judicial scrutiny. In this instance, the decision of the appellant in making the declaration of vacancy was not a decision made during proceedings in the business of the State Assembly. The considerations which the appellant used to make his decision were not matters connected with the business of the proceedings in the State Assembly. The purported absence of the 1st respondent in sittings of the State Assembly was something outside the walls of the State Assembly. Further, since the announcement was made in a press conference, it did not form part of the proceedings of the State Assembly. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> On whether the immunity could be extended to the Speaker of a State Assembly, this was settled by the Federal Court in the case of <i>YAB Dato' Dr Zambry Abd Kadir &amp; Ors v. YB Sivakumar Varatharaju Naidu; Attorney-General Malaysia (Intervener)</i> where the Federal Court held that in a country where the doctrine of supremacy of Parliament did not apply, the powers of Parliament and State Legislature were subject to the FC and what was within its power, when there was a challenge to its decision, was for the courts to decide. (para 44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Article 69 of the CSS was silent as to when the six-month period was supposed to commence. The calculation of the six-month period should commence from the first day of absence without leave and not from the last sitting that a State assemblyman was present at. The periods in which there were no sittings should not be taken into account based on art 70(1) of the CSS providing that there could not be more than a six-month period between sittings of the State Assembly. Accordingly, the 1st respondent was not absent for the period of six months. (paras 49-50)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>David Wong Dak Wah JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> There are two appeals before us. One is Appeal No: B-01-199-2011 (Merit Appeal) which is an appeal against the decision of Shah Alam High Court given on 18 February 2011 allowing encl 1, the terms of which are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The other appeal is Appeal No: B-01-363-2011 ("Setting Aside Appeal") which is an appeal against the decision of Shah Alam High Court given on 4 May 2011 dismissing with costs the appellant's application to set aside the order made in the Merit Appeal dated 18 February 2011 on the ground <i>inter alia</i> that it was a judgment in default.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We heard both the appeals together and reserved judgment to a date to be fixed. We have since considered the respective submissions and now give our decision and grounds for the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In view of the nature of the setting aside appeal, we find it fit that we should deal with that appeal first.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Setting Aside Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> To recap, the appellant had filed an application to set aside the judgment of 18 February 2011 on the ground that the same was a judgment in default. The circumstances in which the appellant premised this application were these.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The matter was originally fixed for hearing on 17 February 2011 for encl 1 (originating summons) and encl 8 (striking out application).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant's solicitors wrote to the court on 11 February 2011 seeking an adjournment of the hearing on 17 February 2011 on the basis that the appellant's counsel, Mr Tommy Thomas was engaged in a trial in Johor Bahru.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Case management of the originating summons was then fixed on 16 February 2011 for the purpose of fixing a hearing date. On that day, after consultation with all parties, the court fixed the matter for hearing on 18 February 2011 at 3pm with directions to counsel to file their outline written submissions and bring them to court on the day of hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> No written request for adjournment was made by counsel for the appellant on the 18 February 2011. Nor did they inform the 1st respondent's solicitors that they intend to apply for an adjournment on 18 February 2011 on the ground that Mr Tommy Thomas would still be in Johor Bahru High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> At the hearing on 18 February 2011 at 3pm, Mr Tommy Thomas's junior counsel appeared and requested for an adjournment of the hearing on the ground that Mr Tommy Thomas was still conducting a trial in Johor Bahru High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> After seeking all the parties' views on this application, particularly with regard to the manner in which the hearing date had been fixed during case management on the 16 February 2011 in the presence of all parties, the learned judge refused to grant an adjournment and proceeded with the hearing of the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The junior counsel did not make any submissions and also did not provide the court with any outline submissions. Submissions by respective counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents were made and they also relied on their respective outline submissions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> After hearing parties, the court on the same day dismissed the appellant's encl 8 (striking out application) and allowed the 1st respondent's prayers (a), (b) and (c) of the encl 1 (originating summons) with costs of RM40,000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant filed the application in the High Court to set aside the purported "default" judgment of 18 February 2011 which was dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision And Reasons</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In respect of this appeal there is only one issue and that is whether the learned judge was correct in not allowing an adjournment requested by the junior counsel at the hearing of encl 1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Before us as in the High Court, learned counsel for the appellant submits that the judgment obtained on 18 February 2011 was a judgment in default as opposed to a judgment on merits given after hearing submissions from counsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> If it was the latter, the law is clear and it is as stated in the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_5_175;"><i>Serac Asia Sdn Bhd v. Sepakat Insurance Brokers Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] 5 MLRA 175</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 1; [2013] 6 CLJ 673; [2013] 4 AMR 385:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant concedes the just stated position, hence his insistence that the circumstances in which the judgment dated 18 February 2011 was given render it a default judgment which would allow the appellant to make an application to set aside as he had done in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned judge in her grounds examined the circumstances and this is what she said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant premised his submission on the basic right of every litigant to be heard which he alleges that the appellant was not given. It is also submitted that the appellant was also denied a lawyer of his choice and no submission on behalf of the appellant was made to the learned judge on 18 February 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Having heard submissions and perused the various affidavits, we are of the view that the crucial event for us to consider is what actually happened during case management on 16 February 2011 before the Deputy Registrar.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> According to Mr Ganesan a/l Nethiganantarajah this is what happened:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Mr Mohd Hafarizam bin Harun counsel for the 1st respondent recollect the event as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The crucial question which one needs to ask is "was the date of 18 February 2011 fixed with the consent of counsel". It is common ground that Mr Tommy Thomas was not free on that date. It is common ground that Mr Ganesan could not contact Mr Tommy Thomas during the short adjournment. Under such circumstance, can we say that the date was agreed by counsel? It is our considered view that it is unlikely that Mr Ganesan had consented to the date unreservedly when in the first place he had informed that the date of 18 February 2011 was not suitable to Mr Tommy Thomas and had asked for another date. It is unfortunate that the Deputy Registrar had not recorded the minutes of the case management accurately and that is to reflect that Mr Tommy Thomas could not be contacted during that short adjournment and as such Mr Ganesan was not able to obtain any instruction from Mr Tommy Thomas.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Had the learned judge been fully apprised of that vital fact, she may have taken a different view. The right of litigant to engage counsel of his choice should not be taken lightly. The Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_314;"><i>Federal Hotel Sdn Bhd v. National Union Of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 314</LINK>; [1983] 1 MLJ 175; [1983] CLJ 150 per Abdoolcader J noted that the refusal of the Industrial Court to allow the litigant's choice of counsel "was a gross violation of the fundamental principles of natural justice". However such counsel of choice must ensure that he does not abuse his right by not attending a hearing date when he had agreed to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We are fully aware that nowadays application for adjournment by litigants cannot be taken for granted and it will only be granted only in exceptional circumstances. That said, we must not lose sight of the paramount duty of the courts and that is to ensure that justice is done in all cases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In the present case, the hearing was heard without the benefit of full submission from Mr Tommy Thomas bearing in mind that it related to an interpretation of the Constitution of Selangor in the context of the power of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in declaring a state seat vacant and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. Needless to say it was very much a public interest matter. Under such circumstances, we ask the question whether justice would not have been better served if the learned judge after hearing counsel for the 1st respondent were to at least adjourn to another short date so that Mr Tommy Thomas be given a chance to reply what had been submitted by respective counsel for the 1st respondent. We see no prejudice to either party if that course of action was taken. The presence of junior counsel with respect does not legitimise the hearing. In fact from the commencement of the hearing the junior counsel had informed that she had no instruction to proceed with the hearing and was not in any position to make any submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Ordinarily, a conclusion as aforesaid would entail this court to set aside the orders of the court made on 18 February 2011 and to remit the matter for retrial on its merits. However, as the issues that arose in this matter were determined by the High Court by way of affidavits and on undisputed factual matrix, this court was entitled to proceed to consider the merits of the appeal. Appeals such as these are disposed by way of a rehearing of the arguments and accordingly there will not be any prejudice caused thereby to the parties. In fact <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;69.;;">s 69(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> (Revised - 1972) states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With that we now consider the merit appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Merit Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The appellant was the Speaker of the 12th State Legislative Assembly of Selangor while the respondent was the assemblyman for N46 Port Klang constituency.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The appellant is empowered under art 69 of the Selangor State Constitution vested to declare assembly seats vacant if the relevant state assemblyman is found to be absent for a period of six months.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The appellant found that the respondent had been absent for six months from sittings of the State Assembly and on 19 February 2011 declared the seat of the respondent vacant as allowed under art 69 of the Selangor State Constitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The factual matrix upon which the appellant exercised his power is undisputed and they were as set out in the submissions of respective counsel and for convenience we adopt the same with some relevant amendments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The 1st respondent attended the Selangor State Legislative Assembly sittings on 12 July 2010 and 15 July 2010. The 1st respondent did not attend the sittings on 8 November 2010 till 16 November 2010 as he was seeking traditional medical treatment. There were no sittings between 15 July 2010 and 8 November 2010. The 1st respondent informed the appellant via a letter that he was unable to attend the sittings from 8 November 2010 to 16 November 2010 as he was seeking traditional medical treatment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The appellant, in a letter dated 21 December 2010, rejected the 1st respondent's reasons for absence and decided that the respondent's absence was without leave.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> On or around 19 January 2011, the appellant through press statements and the mass media, declared the 1st respondent's seat of Selangor State Legislative Assembly N46 Port Klang vacant, purportedly pursuant to art 69 of the Selangor State Constitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The 1st respondent came to know of the appellant's decision through press reports.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The appellant then on 21 January 2011 notified the 2nd respondent, the Election Commission, that the N46 Port Klang seat was vacant. Again the 1st respondent came to know of this fact through press reports. That letter dated 21 January 2011 to the 2nd respondent came to the 1st respondent's sight when reading the Affidavit in Reply of the 2nd respondent affirmed on 7 February 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Subsequently, the 1st respondent first saw a copy of the purported "Declaration" by the Speaker when reading the Affidavit in Reply of the 2nd respondent affirmed on the 7 February 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The decision of the appellant was not made or pronounced during the proceedings of the Selangor State Legislative Assembly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision And Reasons</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In respect of this appeal we are in no doubt that there are only two issues which are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> For issue 1, it concerns the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;72.;;">art 72 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant also relies on art 75 of the Selangor State Constitution which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Premised on the above articles, learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant's action in declaring the seat of N46 Port Klang constituency vacant is not subject to judicial scrutiny. With respect, we are unable to agree and our reasons are these. It should be noted that in both articles they provide that only decisions made during proceedings in the State Assembly are not subject to judicial scrutiny. Can we then say that the decision of the appellant in making the declaration of vacancy was a decision made during proceedings in the business of the State Assembly. We answer in the negative. The considerations in which the appellant used to make his decision were not matters connected with the business of the proceedings in the State Assembly. The purported absence of the 1st respondent in sittings of the State Assembly is something outside the walls of the State Assembly. Further, we agree with the learned judge that since the announcement was made on 19 January 2011 in a press conference, it did not form part of the proceedings of the State Assembly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In any event whether immunity can be extended to the Speaker of a State Assembly is settled by the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_474;"><i>YAB Dato' Dr Zambry Abd Kadir &amp; Ors v. YB Sivakumar Varatharaju Naidu; Attorney-General Malaysia (Intervener)</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 474</LINK>; [2009] 4 MLJ 24; [2009] 4 CLJ 253 where the Federal Court held that in a country where the doctrine of supremacy of Parliament does not apply, the powers of Parliament and State Legislature are subject to province of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> and what is within its power or not, when there is a challenge to its decision, it is for the courts to decide.

      <b>[45]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant's interpretation of art 69 of the Selangor State Constitution is correct. Article 69 reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The crucial issue is whether the 1st respondent had been absent from every sitting for a period of six months. Of relevance to this issue is art 70(1) of the Selangor State Constitution which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The salient facts here to recap are as follows. The first sitting of the State Assembly for 2010 was from 12 to 14 April 2010. In respect of the second sitting the 1st respondent was absent on 13 and 14 July 2010 but for medical reasons. He was however present on the 15 July 2010. From 15 July 2010 till 8 November 2010 there was no sitting. The third sitting commenced from 8 to 12 November and 15 November 2010 which the 1st respondent was absent. The appellant then calculated the six months absence from 16 July 2010 till 16 January 2011 and premised on that the appellant concluded that the 1st respondent had been absent for a period of six months which permitted him to exercise the power provided for in art 69 of the Selangor State Constitution to declare the seat vacant which he did on 19 January 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The learned judge rejected the aforesaid submission in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Article 69, is silent as to when the six month period is supposed to commence. Be that as it may, we are constrained to give art 69 an interpretation which does not completely ignore the clear intention of giving the power to the Speaker to declare a seat vacant and leads to absurdity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Approaching the task in those manners, we are attracted by the contention of the 1st respondent's counsel which is that the calculation of the six month period is to commence from the first day of absence without leave and not from the last sitting which a State assemblyman was present. With such interpretation the periods in which there are no sittings would not be taken into account in the calculation of the six month period. Our view is fortified with the existence of which art 70(1) of the Selangor State Constitution provides that there cannot be more than a six month period between sittings of the State Assembly. Accordingly the commencement of the six months period should be either 8 November 2010 (the first day of the sitting when 1st respondent was absent without leave of absence) or 16 November 2010 (the last day of the sittings for November 2010).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Accordingly we affirm the decision of the learned judge and dismiss the appeal with no order as to costs. We also order the deposit to be refunded.</p>
