    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff was a company in liquidation and the registered owner of two parcels of land, <i>viz</i> PM1336 and PM1337. On 13 July 1992 the plaintiff and the defendant had signed two sale and purchase agreements ("SPAs") for the sale of PM1336 and PM1337. The purchase price was to be paid progressively in accordance with the third schedule to the agreements. However, the plaintiff's liquidator apparently found no documentary evidence that the defendant had made full payment and settlement of the purchase price for PM1336 and PM1337. There was also no evidence that the defendant had paid stamp duty for the transfer of PM1336 and 1337 from the plaintiff to the defendant. Thus the plaintiff applied to declare the two sale and purchase agreements between the plaintiff and the defendant, as rescinded, cancelled and null and void on account of the failure of the defendant to pay the full purchase price and by reason of effluxion of time. The defendant alleged that the full purchase price for PM1336 and PM1337 had been made through a contra arrangement and that transfer Forms - Form 14A - had been prepared by its solicitors and submitted to the Stamp Office for adjudication, but due to a miscommunication with its solicitors, the stamp duty had not been paid and the transfers had not been effected. The defendant further claimed that it had sold both PM1336 and PM1337 to a third party - Zen Hardware - through the execution of a sale and purchase agreement dated 23 September 2008 ("the SPA"). Zen Hardware had in furtherance of the SPA entered private caveats to protect its interests. The High Court allowed the plaintiff's application and the defendant appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the defendant's appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court judge had erred in law in putting the legal burden of proving that the full purchase price had been paid entirely on the defendant in the originating summons before the High Court. There was also a misdirection in that the High Court had failed to give due weightage to the preponderance of evidence that the agreements had been duly executed by the parties as demonstrated by the incontrovertible evidence from the defendant. (paras 32 &amp; 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was inconceivable that the plaintiff would have facilitated the defendant to progress so far as to be on the brink of effecting transfer of PM1336 and PM1337, if full purchase price in whatever form had not been made. (para 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was also telling that the action by the liquidator was taken more than 21 years after the agreements were executed in 1992. The plaintiff had been wound up on 19 August 2002. However, no action had been taken to pursue payment of the purchase price on the agreements or to revoke the agreements or demand the return of the original title deeds of PM1336 and PM1337.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Badariah Sahamid JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal before us is against a decision of the learned High Court Judge given on 4 April 2014 which allowed with costs the plaintiff's originating summons filed by its liquidator on 29 August 2013. The plaintiff had been wound up on 19 August 2002 and is now in liquidation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In the originating summons the plaintiff had sought to declare two sale and purchase agreements both dated 3 July 1992 between the plaintiff and the defendant in respect of two parcels of land, as rescinded, cancelled and null and void on account of the failure of the defendant to pay the full purchase price and by reason of effluxion of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The two parcels of land abovementioned are held under PM1336, Lot No 30668, ('PM1336') and PM1337, Lot No 30669, ('PM1337') both of Mukim of Sungai Buluh, District of Petaling, Selangor. The purchase price of PM1336 is RM738,435.00 and PM1337 is RM761,748.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Plaintiff's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff's submissions are contained in encl 1 and supporting affidavits of the plaintiff's liquidator, Kartar Singh a/l Gurchan Singh affirmed on 21 August 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The plaintiff is a company in liquidation pursuant to a winding up order made on 19 August 2002 by the Shah Alam High Court. The plaintiff is also the registered owner of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On or about 1991 or 1992, the plaintiff proposed to develop PM1336 and PM1337 as industrial lots for a project known as Taman Perindustrian Sungai Buloh. On 3 July 1992 the plaintiff and the defendant signed two sale and purchase agreements for PM1336 and PM1337 ('the agreements'). The purchase price was RM738,435.00 and RM761,748.00 respectively, to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff progressively in accordance to the third schedule to the agreements. Both agreements contain identical clauses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On perusing the records of the plaintiff, the liquidator found no documentary evidence that the defendant had made full payment and settlement of the purchase price of PM1336 and 1337. There is also no evidence that the defendant had paid stamp duty for the transfer of PM1336 and 1337 from the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The liquidator also found evidence that the defendant did not pay the quit rent and assessment for PM1336 and 1337 as required under the agreements. There are arrears of quit rent in the sum of RM107,332.30 for PM1336 and RM130,919.60 for PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The defendant is a dormant company which has not filed its annual returns with the Companies Commission of Malaysia since 1992 and is not in a position to complete the purchase of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The agreements between the plaintiff and defendant were executed in 1992 - more than 21 years ago.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> After a lapse of 21 years the plaintiff seeks to declare the agreements as rescinded, cancelled and null and void owing to the failure of the defendant to pay the full purchase price of PM1336 and PM1337 and by reason of effluxion of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The orders sought are necessary to enable the liquidator of the plaintiff to proceed with the sale of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Defendant's Reply</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The defendant's reply is contained in six affidavits in Reply to encl 1, affirmed by various persons, including Mr Ooi Kock Tiong, (Deponent of Affidavit (1) and (4)) who was one of the Directors of the plaintiff and had signed the agreements on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Mr Ooi had deposed that by agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, the purchase price of PM1336 and PM1337 due from the defendant to the plaintiff was to be set off against the debt owed by the plaintiff to Be Te Construction Sdn Bhd, a related company of the defendant at the material time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Similar contra arrangements for settlement of debts between the plaintiff and the defendant had been carried out involving other associate/related companies of the defendant such as Saga Sentosa Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Unfortunately there are no documents to support the aforesaid contra arrangements in respect of PM1336 and PM1337 as the relevant documents which were kept at the premise of Saga Sentosa Sdn Bhd (which has since been wound up by the Johor Bahru High Court on 18 February 2000) were lost and /or could not be located.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The transfer of PM1336 and PM1337 had been handled by the law firm of Messrs Azman, Davidson &amp; Co. In pursuant of the transfer, the following measures had been taken by the defendant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> On 27 October 1994, both Forms 14A in respect of PM1336 and PM1337 were submitted to the Stamp Duty Office for adjudication.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On 3 December 1994 the Stamp Duty Office had issued Notices Of Assessment on the stamp duty payable on both Forms 14A in respect of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On 26 January 1995, consent was granted by the Petaling Land Office for PM1336 and PM1337 to be transferred from the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> From the above, it is apparent that by 1995 the plaintiff had already done all that was necessary to divest itself of the beneficial interest in PM1336 and PM1337 in favour of the defendant. In consequence thereof, the plaintiff had become a bare trustee of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Unfortunately, due to miscommunication between the defendant and Messrs Azman, Davidson &amp; Co with regard to the stamp duty payable on the Forms 14A for PM1336 and PM1337, the transfer was not effected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The matter was further exacerbated when on the expiry of the consent from the Petaling Land Office on 26 January 1996 (12 months from the date of consent) the perfection of the transfer of PM1336 and PM1337 was left in abeyance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Zen Hardware had occupied and utilised PM1336 and PM1337 since 2002 until todate and had paid for the duties and assessment rates imposed by Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya from 2002 till 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On 23 September 2008, the defendant had executed a sale and purchase agreement with the Zen Hardware in respect of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the preamble to the sale and purchase agreement, the defendant had made the following representations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> All the arrears of quit rent and penalties payable on PM1336 and PM1337 were settled by Zen Hardware, after having obtained some exemption on the penalties imposed by the Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> On 2 March 2009, Zen Hardware had entered private caveats on PM1336 and PM1337 in order to protect their interests.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issues</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The pivotal issue before us is whether the defendant had paid the full purchase price of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The learned High Court Judge allowed the plaintiff's claim. The grounds for the learned judge's decision may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> After careful consideration of the appellant/defendant and respondent/ plaintiff's submissions as well as the affidavits deposed in the originating summons before the High Court, we are of the unanimous opinion that there is merit in the appeal. We therefore allowed the appeal with costs and set aside the decision of the learned High Court Judge for the following reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We agree with the appellant that the learned High Court Judge had erred in law in putting the legal burden of proving that the full purchase price had been paid entirely on the respondent who was the defendant in the originating summons before the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The liquidator had failed to seek confirmation from any of the previous directors/managers/officers of the plaintiff of any records or documentary evidence of payment of purchase price. There is also a marked absence of any affidavit from the same on the status of the agreements. This is especially significant considering that the sale and purchase transactions were conducted between 1992-1995, while the liquidator only commenced the originating summons on 29 August 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> There was also a misdirection in that the High Court had failed to give due weightage to the preponderance of evidence that the agreements had been duly executed by the parties as demonstrated by the following incontrovertible evidence from the defendant/appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> On 3 July 1992 the plaintiff and the defendant had signed two sale and purchase agreements for PM1336 and PM1337. ['The agreements'] Mr Ooi Kock Tiong, (Deponent of Affidavit (1) and (4)) was one of the Directors of the plaintiff and had signed the agreements on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The transfer of PM1336 and PM1337 had been handled by the law firm of Messrs Azman, Davidson &amp; Co. In pursuant of the transfer, the following measures had been taken by the defendant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Established and usual conveyancing practice, as deposed by the Advocate and Solicitor of Zen Hardware, is that the vendor would only release the original title deeds and the original copy of the Memorandum of Transfer to the purchaser/solicitors of the purchaser on full settlement of the purchase price. To do otherwise would go against common sense and logic.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> On 27 October 1994, both Forms 14A in respect of PM1336 and PM1337 were submitted to the Stamp Duty Office for adjudication. On 3 December 1994 the Stamp Duty Office had issued Notices Of Assessment on the stamp duty payable on both Forms 14A in respect of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> On 26 January 1995, consent was granted by the Petaling Land Office for PM1336 and PM1337 to be transferred from the plaintiff to the defendant. It is apparent that by 1995 the plaintiff had already done all that was necessary to divest itself of the beneficial interest in PM1336 and PM1337 in favour of the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> It is inconceivable that the plaintiff would have facilitated the defendant to progress so far as to be on the brink of effecting transfer of PM1336 and PM1337 if full purchase price in whatever form had not been made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It is also telling that the action by the liquidator was taken more than 21 years after the agreements were executed in 1992. The respondent had been wound up on 19 August 2002. However, no action was taken to pursue payment of the purchase price on the agreements or to revoke the agreements or demand the return of the original title deeds of PM1336 and PM1337.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> For the reasons stated above we find sufficient grounds to allow this appeal with costs.</p>
