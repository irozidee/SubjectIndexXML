    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court in dismissing his application for judicial review to, <i>inter alia</i>, quash the decision of the respondents in terminating his service with the Royal Malaysian Navy or Tentera Laut diRaja Malaysia ('TLDM'). The appellant was terminated from service under "The Queen's Regulations For the Royal Navy Revised 1967, Article 0877 Discharge - Service No Longer Required (SNLR)" ('QRRN'). In this appeal, the appellant's main contention was that the QRRN was no longer applicable pursuant to the repeal of the Navy Ordinance 1958 ('said Ordinance') under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1) of the Armed Forces Act 1972 ('AFA')</LINK> as the QRRN was only used or applied by virtue of s 10 of the said Ordinance and it was never made under or enacted pursuant to the said Ordinance. On the other hand, the respondents contended, amongst others, that it was clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> that all regulations made under or applied under the said Ordinance, shall so long as they were not inconsistent with the provisions of the AFA, remain in force; the QRRN remained in force even after the said Ordinance was repealed because to date no regulations had been enacted under the AFA to provide for the enlistment, discharge and dismissal of its members; and in addition, the Armed Forces Council ('the Council') had, in its meeting on 31 March 1998, approved the application of the QRRN thus rendering it valid and enforceable. Accordingly, the main issue for determination was whether the QRRN still had the force of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>Per Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA (delivering the majority judgment of the court):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;271.;;">Section 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>, being a savings provision, was very clear in its intention, which was to save all subordinate or subsidiary legislation made under the repealed enactments and ordinances set-out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1) of the AFA</LINK>, which in this instance was the said Ordinance. Hence, the words "made under" must be given its plain and ordinary meaning and could not be extended to include regulations applied by s 10(1) of the said Ordinance. If it was the intention of the legislature to save such regulations it could have done so by adding the words "or applied under" after the words "made under" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>. (paras 48-49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> As the QRRN was punitive in nature in that it provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the termination of service of members of the TLDM, it was imperative that the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> be given a strict construction such that only regulations made under the said Ordinance were saved and not regulations applied by the said Ordinance. It would be straining the language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217S.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> too much if the words "made under" were construed to mean "applied under". Further, it must be remembered that the purpose of a savings provision such as that contained in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> was to save all subsidiary legislation made under the principal legislation as the repeal of the principal legislation, ie the said Ordinance, had the effect of repealing all subsidiary legislation made under it unless it was saved by a saving provision. (paras 50-52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was significant that the said Ordinance itself made a distinction between regulations made under the said Ordinance and regulations applied by virtue of s 10 of the said Ordinance. Section 11 of the said Ordinance provided that the Council may by order amend, adapt or repeal the First Schedule to the said Ordinance, and any enactment or regulation applied to the Navy by s 10 of the said Ordinance. Para 3 of the First Schedule stipulated that all regulations made under s 16 of the said Ordinance shall be deemed to modify any enactment or regulation applied under s 10 insofar as it conflicted with the first mentioned regulations. Therefore, regulations made under s 16 and regulations applied by virtue of s 10 of the said Ordinance were different and treated differently by the said Ordinance. In the circumstances, the repeal of the said Ordinance would mean that the regulations applied by s 10, which included the QRRN, would by virtue of that repeal be also repealed. (paras 55-58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The Council had no power under the AFA to approve the application or the continued usage of the QRRN. The Council had power (with the approval of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong) to make regulations under the AFA but only with respect to specific matters. It however did not have power to approve the continued application of the QRRN. As such, its approval of the continued usage or application of the QRRN had no legal effect and was purely administrative in nature. (paras 61-63)</p>
    <p>Per Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA (dissenting):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In construing <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>, the purposive approach must be applied. The purpose of the saving provision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217 of the AFA</LINK> was to save all regulations, orders, and other instruments applicable to the armed forces under the repealed enactments or ordinances in so far as they were not inconsistent with the provision of AFA. In this instance, the words "apply to the officers and ratings of or serving with the navy" found in s 10 of the said Ordinance must be given a construction that was meaningful and to the effect that, in relation to the QRRN, it was made under the said Ordinance. Here, the application of the QRRN to the Malaysian Naval Officers and Ratings under the said Ordinance was by operation of law that was with the coming into force of s 10 of the said Ordinance. With the presence of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of AFA</LINK>, the QRRN was saved because its saving was necessary for a continuous and proper functioning and administration of TLDM. At present there was no specific regulations being drafted or made under AFA to provide for the discipline and discharge of TLDM personnel. Therefore, the word "made" used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> could not be read literally. (paras 91 &amp; 94)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In determining whether the QRRN was applicable in the instant case, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;216.;;">s 216 of the AFA</LINK> which provided for the transitional provision which shall take effect on the date of coming into force of the AFA must be considered. The transitional provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;216.;;">s 216</LINK> of the AFA made references to offences under the Naval Discipline Act of United Kingdom 1957 and for offences there under. Therefore, the saving of the QRRN was part and parcel of the legal regime governing the discipline of naval personnel applicable to the TLDM under the saving provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>. (paras 95-96)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The Council was established under the provision of the Federal Constitution and was charged with the command, discipline and administration of, and all other matters relating to the armed forces, other than matters relating to their operational use. In this regard, reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;155.;;">s 155 of the AFA</LINK> was helpful, as that section empowered the Council to make regulations in respect of matters for which regulations and Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera might be made. Thus, even though the QRRN was not literally made under the said Ordinance, its application to TLDM personnel was valid and lawful by virtue of the order of the Council made in its meeting.

    <p>
      <b>Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal before us stems from the decision of the learned High Court Judge in Kuala Lumpur who had dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review to, <i>inter alia</i>, quash the decision of the respondents in terminating his service with the Royal Malaysian Navy or Tentera Laut diRaja Malaysia (TLDM).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant was a non-commissioned serviceman with the TLDM at the time of his termination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 20 August 2010, the appellant was remanded in IPD Petaling Jaya for allegedly misusing 'Waran penerbangan Udara' or flight warrants. He was later charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_613;56.;;">s 56(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001 at the Kuala Lumpur High Court</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondents then decided to terminate his services on the ground his services were no longer required and that he had caused disrepute to TLDM.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Pursuant thereto, a letter was issued to the 3rd respondent on 3 March 2011 to submit the application for the appellant to be terminated under "The Queen's Regulations For The Royal Navy Revised 1967 (QRRN) Article 0877 - Discharge Service No Longer Required (SNLR)". (See p 46 of the Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant was asked by the 3rd respondent to assist in preparing the application for his termination. The appellant however refused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondents then took action against the appellant and charged him for insubordination under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;49.;;">s 49(b) of the Armed Forces Act 1972 (AFA)</LINK>. He was found guilty and imposed a sentence of "tahanan cuti 28 hari" with effect from 21 February 2012 and a warning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Based on the same finding of insubordination the 1st respondent instructed the 3rd respondent (Komander Rafe bin Hashim) the initiate the process for the appellant to be terminated from service under "The Queen's Regulations For the Royal Navy Revised 1967 (QRRN) Article 0877 Discharge - Service No Longer Required (SNLR) "(the Queen's Regulations)".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 3rd respondent acted accordingly and on 21 February 2012 the 1st respondent approved the appellant's termination, under the aforesaid Queen's Regulations, the termination to take effect on 29 March 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Aggrieved with the respondent's decision, the appellant filed an application for judicial review seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The learned judge dismissed the appellant's application. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Before us the appellant confined himself only to one issue, namely, whether the Queen's Regulations still have the force of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Contention</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The Queen's Regulations is no longer applicable pursuant to the repeal of the Navy Ordinance 1958 under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1) of the Armed Forces Act 1972 (AFA)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The Queen's Regulations was only used or applied by virtue of the repealed Navy Ordinance 1958. They were never made under or enacted pursuant to the Navy Ordinance 1958 (the said Ordinance).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The said Ordinance together with the Malay Regiment Enactment, the Federation Regiment Ordinance 1952, the Military Force Ordinance 1952, the Air Forces Ordinance 1958, the Territorial Army Ordinance 1958, the Naval Volunteer Reserve Ordinance 1958 and the Air Force Volunteer Reserve Ordinance 1958 were repealed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1) of the AFA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The appellant contended that although <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> provided that "rules, regulations ... made under the enactment and ordinances hereby repealed shall remain in force until specifically repealed", this provision did not apply to the Queen's Regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The reason, according to learned counsel is that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> only saves those rules and regulations made under the repealed enactment and ordinances, including the said Ordinance. The Queen's Regulations on the other hand were never made under the said Ordinance. It was merely applied by virtue of s 10 of the said Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Learned counsel submitted that the learned judge erred in holding that the Queen's Regulations still has the force of law in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In holding such, the High Court, according to counsel, had departed from an earlier High Court decision in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_2_35;"><i>Md Redzuan Alang lwn. Panglima Tentera Laut &amp; Satu Lagi</i> [2010] 2 MLRH 35</LINK>, [2011] 1 CLJ 656 where the learned Judicial Commissioner held that the Queen's Regulations were deemed inapplicable as they were not made under the said Ordinance and hence did not fall within the proviso in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Arising from the above, there is now two conflicting decisions on the applicability of the Queen's Regulations in this country.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Apart from the fact that the Queen's Regulations were not made under the said Ordinance, the said Regulations are no longer enforceable for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> That being the case, the respondent cannot purport to rely on an "old regulations which was merely applied vide a repealed statute" to terminate the appellant's service with TLDM. To do so would defeat the purpose of AFA as a consolidating statute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Accordingly it was learned counsel's submission that any disciplinary action against the appellant must be grounded in the provisions of the AFA and not in "an old naval regulation of a foreign country."</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondents' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The respondents rely essentially on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> to support their contention that the Queen's Regulations, in particular Article 0877 SNLR under which the appellant's services with TLDM was terminated, are valid and enforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> According to learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) it is clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> that, <i>inter alia</i> all regulations made under or applied under the said repealed Ordinance, shall so long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the AFA, remain in force until specifically repealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The Queen's Regulations were applied to the officers and ratings of or serving with the Royal Malaysian Navy (TLDM) pursuant to s 10 of the said Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Section 10 of the said Ordinance stipulated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Thus although under s 271(1) of the AFA the said Ordinance is repealed, the regulations including the Queen's Regulations made thereunder continue to remain in force so long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of AFA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The reason why these regulations remain in force after the said Ordinance is repealed is because to date no regulations have been enacted under the AFA to provide for <i>inter alia</i>, the enlistment, discharge and dismissal of its members.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In the absence of such regulations the Queen's Regulations (whose applicability is saved by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>) provides the authority under which TLDM exercises its power to terminate or dismiss its members.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In additions to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>, the respondent also relied on the fact that the Armed Forces Council had, in its meeting on 31 March 1998, approved the application of the Queen's Regulations thus rendering it valid and enforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Having considered carefully the submissions of learned counsel and learned SFC and having perused the Records of Appeal we had, by a majority decided to allow the appeal with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Our reasons are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> This issue arose, as we have seen earlier from the decision of the respondents to terminate the appellant from the service of the TLDM for insubordination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The respondent's decision was made in accordance with Article 0877 of the Queen's Regulations which provides for Discharge SNLR (Service No Longer Required), Under Article 0877, Discharge SNLR can be invoked in situations, amongst others as in the present case, where discharge is considered to be in the best interests of the service due to the nature of the appellant's misconduct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> It is not in dispute that the Queen's Regulations were regulations which apply to the British Royal Navy and its application to the Royal Malaysian Navy (TLDM) was made possible by virtue of s 10(1) of the said Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Section 10(1) is clear in its terms as to the application of, <i>inter alia</i>, the Queen's Regulations to the officers and members of TLDM. For convenience s 10(1) is reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The word 'apply' as we shall see later assumes significance when we interpret the provision <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The said Ordinance and with it s 10 was repealed upon the coming into force of the AFA. The AFA came into force on 1 June 1976 and vide s <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">217(1)</LINK> the said Ordinance together with other Enactments and Ordinances pertaining to the armed forces were declared repealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Notwithstanding the repeal of the said Ordinance under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1)</LINK>, subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217</LINK> provides that "... all rules, regulations, orders and other instruments made under the enactments and ordinances hereby repealed, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, shall remain in force until specifically repealed."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> As can be seen <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> is a savings provision which seeks to save all subordinate or subsidiary legislation made under the various repealed Enactments and Ordinances set-out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1) of the AFA</LINK>. In other words <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> seeks to preserve the validity or enforceability of such subordinate or subsidiary legislation so long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the AFA, until they are specifically repealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The question that arises here is whether the Queen's Regulations which application to the TLDM is made possible by s 10(1) of the said Ordinance can be said to be, by virtue thereof, regulations made under the said Ordinance and therefore continue to remain in force even though the said Ordinance has been repealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The appellants was of the firm view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> does not save the Queen's Regulations as they were never made under the said Ordinance, that is they were not enacted under the said Ordinance. They were merely applied under the repealed statute. Hence with the repeal of the said Ordinance, the Queen's Regulations no longer have the force of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The respondents on the other hand was of the view that the Queen's Regulations is still law by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The respondents accept that the Queen's Regulations were not made under the said Ordinance. They nevertheless contend that as these regulations were applied under s 10 of the said Ordinance, they can be said to be made under the said Ordinance and therefore is saved by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of AF</LINK>A.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The learned judge agreed with the respondents submission and found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> We are, with due respect to the learned judge, unable to agree with Her Ladyship's proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In our view <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK>, being a savings provision is very clear in its intention, which is to save all subordinate or subsidiary legislation made under the repealed enactments and ordinances set-out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1)</LINK>, which in our case is the said Ordinance or the Navy Ordinance 1958.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The words "made under" must be given its plain and ordinary meaning and cannot be extended to include regulations applied by s 10(1) of the said Ordinance. If it was the intention of the legislature to save such regulations they could have done so by adding the words "or applied under" after the words "made under" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> As the Queen's Regulations are punitive in nature in that it provides, <i>inter alia</i> for the termination of service of members of the TLDM, it is imperative that the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> be given a strict construction such that only regulations made under the said Ordinance are saved and not regulations applied by the said Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> It would be straining the language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> too much if the words "made under" are construed to mean "applied under".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> It must be remembered that the purpose of a savings provision such as that contained in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> is to save all subsidiary legislation made under the principal legislation as the repeal of the principal legislation, such as the said Ordinance in our case, has the effect of repealing all subsidiary legislation made under it unless it is saved by a savings provision. (See GC Thornton on <i>Legislative Drafting</i>, 4th edn, p 388).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> A similar provision is found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;28.;;">s 28 of Act 388</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In the case of the said Ordinance the regulations would be those made under s 16 of the said Ordinance. Section 16(1) confers power on the Armed Forces Council, with the approval of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to make regulations to provide for, <i>inter alia</i>, the terms and conditions of service of officers and ratings of the navy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> It is significant that the said Ordinance itself makesFa distinction between regulations made under the said Ordinance and regulations applied by virtue of s 10. This can be seen in s 11 and para 3 of the First Schedule to the said Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Section 11 of the said Ordinance provides that the Armed Forces Council may by order amend, adapt or repeal the First Schedule to this Ordinance, and any enactment or regulation applied to the Navy by s 10. Paragraph 3 of the First Schedule stipulates that all regulations made under s 16 shall be deemed to modify any enactment or regulation applied under s 10 insofar as they conflict with the first mentioned regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> It can therefore be surmised that regulations made under s 16 and regulations applied by virtue of s 10 of the said Ordinance are different and treated differently by the said Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In the circumstances it is our view that the repeal of the said Ordinance would mean that the regulations applied by s 10, which includes the Queen's Regulations, would by virtue of that repeal be also repealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> It would be different, in our view, had the law, namely the said Ordinance, provides expressly that regulations applied by s 10 shall be deemed to be made under the said Ordinance. In such a situation, the regulations would fall within the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> of the AFA and they would by virtue thereof remain enforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In this regard we are also unable to agree with the learned High Court Judge when she held that the Queen's Regulations remained enforceable by virtue of it being approved by the Armed Forces Council. This is what the learned judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> We agree with learned counsel for the appellant that the Armed Forces Council has no power under the AFA to approve the application or the continued usage of the Queen's Regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The Armed Forces Council has power (with the approval of the Yang di- Pertuan Agong) to make regulations under the AFA but only with respect to specific matters as spelt out in, for example, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;15.;;">s 15</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;36.;;">s 36</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;155.;;">s 155</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;157.;;">s 157 of the AFA</LINK>. It however does not have power to approve as stated earlier the continued application of the Queen's Regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> As such its approval of the continued usage or application of the Queen's Regulations on 31 March 1998 has no legal effect and is purely administrative in nature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> In conclusion we would state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">Section 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> cannot save the Queen's Regulations as the latter are not made under the said Ordinance but are applied in this country by virtue of s 10 of the said Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Secondly, the decision of the Armed Forces Council to approve the application of the Queen's Regulations is of no legal consequence as it does not have the power to do so under the AFA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> Thirdly, we agree with the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner in the case of <i>Md Redzuan Alan (supra)</i>when she opined with regard to the same issue before her:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> For the above reasons therefore the appeal, by a majority, is allowed, with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The main issue in this appeal is this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The appellant ("Simathari") was a non-commissioned serviceman with the Royal Malaysian Navy. Simathari was accused of a crime relating to flight warrants. He was charged in a criminal court but was discharged of the crime. His commanding officer, the 3rd respondent ("Commander Rafe"), ordered him to sign a dismissal form admitting to the alleged crime. Simathari refused. Because of this refusal he was found guilty of insurbordination pursuant to the Armed Forces Act 1972 ("AFA"). He was tried summarily and punished with a sentence of suspension of leave and a warning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> Subsequently, based on the same insubordination finding, the 1st respondent (the "Admiral") instructed Commander Rafe bin Hashim to initiate the process for Simathari to be terminated under the Queen's Regulations. Commander Rafe did so. There were no other regulations in place or in force then that were applicable to the Royal Malaysian Navy for the discharge or termination of its personnel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The Admiral then made the decision to terminate Simathari's services from the Royal Malaysian Navy, using the purported power under the Queen's Regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> His service was terminated under Article 0877 of the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy, Revised 1967 (the "Queen's Regulations"). Simathari sought judicial review on the grounds that the Queen's Regulations were inapplicable in Malaysia. He failed. Hence, this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> After hearing the appeal my learned sister Justice Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin and my learned brother Justice Varghese George Varughese agreed that the appeal be allowed. However, I had a different view. On the law and the facts, it is my considered opinion that the appeal be dismissed. I now give the reasons for my decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> Before the coming into force of the AFA, each branch of the Armed Forces - the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, was governed by its own respective laws and regulations. The relevant law for this appeal is the Navy Ordinance 1958 ("the Ordinance") which was applicable to His Majesty the Federation Naval Forces then. The Naval Ordinance was enacted by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong with the advice and consent of the then Legislative Council (the forerunner of our present Parliament). The purpose of the Ordinance was to provide for the establishment, discipline and regulation of a Navy in the Federation. By virtue of s 10(1) of the Ordinance, all the enactment and regulations for the time being in force and applicable to the (British) Royal Navy were applied to the officers and ratings of or serving with the Malayan (later Malaysian) Royal Navy whether ashore or afloat or within or without the limits of the Federation. For ease of reference and to appreciate its full impact, s 10 of the Ordinance is reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> It also pertinent to keep in mind the provision of s 11 of the Ordinance which empowered the Armed Forces Council to adapt, amend or repeal any enactment or regulation applied to the Navy by s 10. Section 11 of the Ordinance reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> It is undisputed fact that the appellant was dismissed based on "Article 0877 Discharge - Service No Longer Required. Retention undesirable to the interest of Service - of The Queen's Regulation For the Royal Navy (Revised 1967) ("QRRN")". This fact was averred in the affidavit by the respondent affirmed on 18 September 2012 by one Commander Rafe bin Hashim - paras 6 and 8 of the affidavit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> The QRRN was made applicable to the Royal Malaysian Navy by the Armed Forces Council's decision at its 366th meeting on 31 March 1998. The Navy Ordinance 1958 was repealed by the Armed Forces Act 1972. It is to be noted that the decision to discharge the appellant from the navy was communicated to the appellant on 2 March 2012 and the discharge was to take effect on 29 March 2013. Thus at the time the decision taken to discharge the appellant and at the time the decision became effective, the applicable and relevant QRRN was already in place and in force for quite some time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> The primary complaint by the appellant is that the QRRN was not <b>made</b> under the AFA (bold for emphasis). It was made <b>applicable</b> to the Royal Malaysian Navy by the Order of the Armed Forces Council in 1998, well after the 1958 Naval Ordinance had been repealed by the AFA which came into force in 1972.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> It was argued for the appellant that the QRRN was never made pursuant to or under the repealed Naval Ordinance 1958; it was merely applied under that repealed ordinance. Therefore it is not saved by the saving provision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217 of the AFA</LINK>. My learned sister Justice Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin and my learned brother Justice Varghese George Varughese accepted this argument and have read the word 'made' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK> literally.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> The repeal provision in the AFA is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217</LINK> and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> Thus, subsection (2) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217 of the AFA</LINK> is the saving provision for all the rules, regulations, orders and instruments made under the repealed laws of the armed forces.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> The learned High Court Judge, Justice Rohana Yusuf (as Her Ladyship then was), accepted the fact that the QRRN was not 'made' under the repealed 1958 Naval Ordinance. However she held the view that the QRRN was applied by virtue of s 10 of the repealed 1958 Naval Ordinance to the Royal Malaysian Navy. Her Ladyship said in her decision as follows: "[11] First, in my considered view, even though technically speaking QRRN not enacted under the Navy Ordinance, it was applied by virtue of s 10 of the said Ordinance and was applicable to the British Royal Navy as well as the Royal Malaysian Navy. In my view the fact that QRRN was applied by virtue of the Navy Ordinance then, it is as good as it is made under the Ordinance and hence <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217</LINK> applies. In my view even though under s 217(2), QRRN was not made under the Navy Ordinance it was applied under the said Ordinance, all the same."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> However in another High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_2_35;"><i>Md Redzuan Alang lwn. Panglima Tentera Laut &amp; Satu Lagi</i> [2010] 2 MLRH 35</LINK>, [2011] 1 CLJ 656 the High Court came to a different conclusion and in that case the learned Zurah Yahya JC held that "QRRN yang merupakan peraturan bagi tentera laut British telah dibenarkan pemakaian mengikut s 10 Navy Ordinance 1958. Ianya bukan peraturan yang dibuat dibawah Navy Ordinance 1958. Oleh itu, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> Akta berkenaan tidak dapat menyelamatkan pemakaian QRRN daripada pemansuhan".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> Thus, it was submitted that there are now two conflicting High Court decision on this issue and that the High Court decision in <i>Md Redzuan (supra)</i>is the correct decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> It was also submitted by the appellant that the AFA being a consolidating statute, consolidated all codifications pertaining to the armed forces and expressly repeals all previous ordinances concerning the army, including the Navy Ordinance 1958. It is therefore cannot be lawful, it was argued, for the respondents to attempt to rely on an old regulation (one from Britain, what more) which was merely applied vide a repealed statute. If this is the case, it was contended that the consolidating raison d'etre behind the Armed Forces Act 1972 is lost.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> It was further submitted for the appellant that the express wording of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(1) of AFA</LINK> in sweeping away all previous orders, regulations etc, means that the intention of Parliament was to establish one all-governing statute for a class of persons (here, the armed forces).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> Next, it was submitted that the High Court below erred in holding that the QRRN had force of law by virtue of it being approved by the Armed Forces Council in its 366th meeting on 31 March 1998. It was argued that the Armed Forces Council has no legislative powers. It cannot approve the use of a law from a foreign land. The Armed Forces Council, it was said, had on its own interpreted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217 of AFA</LINK> when it is not an authority on interpreting a statute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> Furthermore, the QRRN is not found in the Gazette. The Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 hold that for subsidiary legislation to have force, it must first be published in the Gazette.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> For these reasons, it was submitted that the appellant's termination pursuant to the QRRN is unlawful.</p>
    <p>
      <b>My Opinion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> In my view, in construing <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>, one must apply the purposive approach and not to read the words literally. The purpose of the saving provision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217 of the AFA</LINK> is to save all regulations, orders, and other instruments applicable to the armed forces under the repealed enactments or ordinances in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provision of AFA. [The argument here is not that the Regulations, Orders and instruments (in particular the relevant QRRN) under the repealed enactments or ordinances are inconsistent with the provisions of the AFA. Rather, the argument is that the relevant QRRN was applied and not made under the repealed ordinance which is the Navy Ordinance 1958].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17.;;">Section 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> provides that in interpreting a statute, regard must be given to the purpose of the statute. The AFA is a consolidating statute. That is to say the purpose is to consolidate all the principal laws or statute pertaining to the armed forces under one principal Act. How does one construe consolidating act or statute? The learned authors of <i>NS Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes</i>, 9th edn had this to say at p 998:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> However, in order to avoid any lacuna in the law applicable to the armed forces following such consolidation, the legislature in its wisdom has provided a saving provision whereby all subsidiary matters such as regulations, orders or instruments made under the repealed ordinances and enactments applicable to the armed forces previously are saved and continued to be applicable. Again, referring to <i>NS Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes</i>, 9th edn at p 1421, the learned authors comment on 'Saving Clause' is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> In this respect, the words "apply to the officers and ratings of or serving with the navy" found in s 10 of the repealed Naval Ordinance 1958 (No 27 of 1958) must be given a construction that is meaningful and to the effect that, in relation to the QRRN, it was made under the Naval Ordinance 1958 for that purpose. I say this because the application of the QRRN to the Malayan (now Malaysian) Naval Officers and Ratings under the repealed ordinance was by operation of law that is with the coming into force of s 10 of the 1958 Ordinance. With the presence of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of AFA</LINK>, the QRRN was saved because its saving is necessary for a continuous and proper functioning and administration of the Malaysian Navy, a critical branch of the Malaysian Armed Forces. It is a fact that as at present there is no specific regulations being drafted or made under AFA to provide for the discipline and discharge of Malaysian Naval personnel. One cannot imagine how a naval force can function as efficient and well regimented branch of the Armed Forces if there is no regulations to discipline or punish officer or ratings for misconduct. Therefore I do not agree with the suggestion that the word made used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2)</LINK> be read literally.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> In determining whether the QRRN is applicable in this case, one must also have regard to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;216.;;">s 216 of the AFA</LINK>. This section provides for the transitional provision which shall take effect on the date of coming into force of AFA. Subsection 2 and subsection 4 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;216;;">s 216 of the AFA</LINK> are worth noting. And these subsections read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> It can be seen from the above transitional provisions, references were made to offences under the Naval Discipline Act of United Kingdom 1957 and for offences there under. Therefore in my view the saving of the QRRN is part and parcel of the legal regime governing the discipline of naval personnel applicable to the Malaysian Navy under the saving provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;217.;;">s 217(2) of the AFA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> With regard to the argument that the QRRN was made applicable by the Armed Forces Council in its 366th meeting as evidenced by the minutes of meeting, and which learned counsel for the appellant had argued that it is not the authority that can make laws and regulations for the armed forces, one must have regard to the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;137.;;">art 137(1)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;137.;;">(2)</LINK> of the Federal Constitution. These two provisions read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> It can be seen that the Armed Forces Council was established under the provision of the Federal Constitution and is charged with the command, discipline and administration of, and all other matters relating to the armed forces, other than matters relating to their operational use. In this regard, reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;77.;;">s 155 of AFA</LINK> is helpful. This section empowers the Armed Forces Council to make regulation in respect of matters for which regulations and Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera may be made. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;155.;;">Section 155</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is to be noted that the expression "this Part" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_77;155.;;">s 155 of AFA</LINK> cited above is a reference to Part V of AFA which deals with service, offences and punishment including mutiny and insubordination. In other words, Part V of AFA deals with the disciplinary aspect of the armed forces.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> For the above reasons, I do not agree that the Armed Forces Council does not have the authority to make or direct the application of QRRN to the Malaysian Navy. Even though QRRN was not literally made under the repealed Naval Ordinance 1958, its application to the Malaysian Naval personnel is valid and lawful by virtue of the order of the Armed Forces Council made in its 366th meeting. Furthermore, as I have said above, the QRRN which was made under the United Kingdom or the British Naval Discipline Act 1957 was made applicable by way of operation of law under s 10 of the repealed Navy Ordinance 1958.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> Accordingly, I will dismiss the appeal. Lastly, learned counsel for the appellant in his memorandum of appeal had also raised several other issues; however in the course of his oral submissions before this court he had indicated that he is not pursuing the other issues in his memorandum of appeal. Therefore, I take it that he had decided to abandon them.</p>
