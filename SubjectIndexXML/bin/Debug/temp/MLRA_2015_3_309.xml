    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant ("the bank"), through a facility agreement, granted the 1st respondent, Worthy Builders Sdn Bhd ("Worthy"), a sum of RM6 million ("the facility amount") for construction works to be done. As security for the facility amount, the bank obtained a deed of assignment ("the said assignment") of all the proceeds for work to be done by Worthy, which formed part of the security documents. In the High Court, the trial judge refused to enter judgment for the bank against a claim for the facility amount offered to Worthy and, instead, judgment was entered against the bank for debts owed from third parties to Worthy on the ground that the bank breached its fiduciary duty of not carrying out Worthy's instructions. Accordingly, the bank was made liable to pay Worthy for proceeds based on the said assignment. In addition, the bank's counterclaim to recover the facility amount from Worthy and the guarantors was dismissed. Hence, the bank filed this appeal. Here, the issues to be decided were, amongst others, whether the security documents secured by the bank in granting the facility were documents of liability; whether the security documents placed an obligation on the bank to act to recover the proceeds due to Worthy for work done contractually and/or as a fiduciary; whether the said assignment was bad in law; and whether the demand by the bank to recover the facility amount had merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Upon a perusal of the facility agreement, it was clear that the said assignment was only security for the facilities. The securities became enforceable only upon default of the borrower, and there was no legal obligation to enforce the securities immediately upon default. Furthermore, there was no provision in the facility agreement or the security document that stipulated that, upon default of Worthy or other parties, the bank must act immediately upon the security documents and/or was obliged in law to act upon Worthy's instruction to realise its debts through the security documents. (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, it was not in dispute that Worthy did not give a 'notice of assignment' in the manner as per the form agreed by the parties, as set out in the said assignment. Neither was there evidence to say the bank consented to the variation of the notice of assignment. Hence, the assignment notice by Worthy was not in compliance with the relevant clauses of the said assignment. Furthermore, the cases of <i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd</i> and <i>Hipparion (M) Sdn Bhd v. Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd</i> all recognised the right of the assignor to sue independently of the right of the assignee. Therefore, the assignor's right to sue was protected and there was no necessity in law or equity to find fault with the bank when Worthy itself could have sued with the consent of the bank, or could have made the bank one of the defendants. Accordingly, the said assignment was bad in law and in consequence, the judgment against the bank could not be sustained. (paras 31, 32, 34 &amp; 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The trial judge ought to have allowed the bank's claim against Worthy and the guarantors anchored as a counterclaim based on the pleadings, evidence and the law. There was no evidence adduced by Worthy or the guarantors of the disputed sum relating to the facility agreement which they had to pay. From the evidence and the pleadings, the demand notices on the guarantors were served according to law and the submission of the bank on this issue had merit. (paras 38-39)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant (bank) appeals against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who refused to enter judgment for the appellant against a claim for facility offered to the 1st respondent, Worthy Builders Sdn Bhd (Worthy), and entered judgment against the bank for debt owing from third parties to Worthy on the ground that the bank has breached its fiduciary duty of not carrying out Worthy's instructions to the bank. The 2nd and 3rd respondents are guarantors to the facility agreement. Other defendants in the original suit by Worthy (as plaintiff), ie Warisan Nusa Sdn Bhd (Warisan) and KUB Realty Sdn Bhd (KUB) are not appealing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In the instant case, the bank has given facility to Worthy in the sum of RM6 million and as security for the facility has obtained an assignment of proceeds for work to be done by Worthy for the UMNO building, the details of which are set out in para 4 below. By the judgment of the court, the bank had been made liable to pay to Worthy for the proceeds which Worthy is entitled to receive for works done in relation to the UMNO building amounting to about RM13 million. In addition, the bank was not able to recover from Worthy the facility given. The benefit to Worthy is that it was able to get judgment relating to sum due from work done for the UMNO building to them through the bank. In addition, Worthy has benefited by not paying the facility amount. That is to say, Worthy has been enriched by the judgment. As it stands, there is no judicial precedent similar to the facts of the instant case cited by the parties or dealt by the learned trial judge. We will further elaborate on this issue in great detail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The title of the suit of parties in the High Court as well as the Court of Appeal needs to be set out to appreciate their interest and claim without confusion.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Original Action</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In the original action, Worthy sued the bank, Warisan and Nusa on the following basis, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Worthy's argument succeeded before the learned High Court Judge and the learned High Court Judge ordered the bank, Warisan and KUB to pay Worthy a sum of RM13,122,807.09 and that part of the judgment reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The claim of the bank against Worthy and the guarantors for the facility provided was dismissed. And that part of the judgment reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned trial judge, in respect of the bank's claim against Worthy and the guarantors, at the early part of the judgment said why the bank's claim cannot be allowed notwithstanding the fact that Worthy and/or guarantors had not disputed the sum in any material context according to law by replying to the letter of demand or in the pleadings. The learned judge, with respect, did not do a balancing exercise of claims and competing claims. The threshold burden is only on a balance of probabilities. The law requires that any party disputing a sum ought to protest at the earliest opportunity, and remaining in silence will not permit him, in law, to escape liability. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_185;"><i>Syarikat Telekom Malaysia v. Business Chinese Directory Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 185</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 692; [1997] 1 CLJ 596; [1997] 2 AMR 1191]. By protesting to the claim, the court will be obliged to consider and arrive at a just amount, according to law. The learned judge's findings on the bank's claim read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned trial judge in finding in favour of Worthy had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned judge in her judgment sets out the facts and the law. In our considered view, with respect, there is a grave error of law and the application of the law to the facts. The cases the learned trial judge had relied on have little relevance to the facts of the instant case and on the law on assignment of this nature (security documents). The cases relied on by the learned trial judge, namely: (i) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_629;"><i>Abdul Rahim Abdul Hamid &amp; Ors v. Perdana Merchant Bankers Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 629</LINK>; [2006] 3 CLJ 1, (ii) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_521;"><i>Bank Utama (Malaysia) Bhd v. Insan Budi Sdn Bhd</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 521</LINK>; [2009] 1 MLJ 148; [2009] 1 CLJ 221 and (iii) <i>Go Dante Yap v. Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG</i> [2011] 4 SLR 559, have no relevance to the deeds of assignment and Powers of Attorney which had been executed as security documents and/or collaterals for the facility granted by the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In our considered view, the learned trial judge's proposition or the <i>ratio decidendi</i>, if sustained, will result in this: security documents secured by banks in granting facility will become 'documents of liability'. This ultimately, will affect the banking industry in an unprecedented manner. Courts have repeatedly emphasised that judgments relating to commercial case must promote 'commercial certainty'. The common sense approach is also another factor which needs to be taken into account in a situation of lender and borrower. for example, the Privy Council in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_53;"><i>Keng Soon Finance Bhd v. MK Retnam Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 53</LINK>; [1989] 1 MLJ 457; [1989] 1 CLJ 1 applied the 'common sense approach' when it dealt with facility documents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Three Cases And Jurisprudence Relating To Security Documents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In general, a security document means a document that provides a security interest in the property or asset (whether tangible or intangible) that is pledged as collateral. In the event the borrower defaults, then the security document is acted upon at the discretion of the lender to salvage whatever losses incurred. In essence, the security document does not form the primary contractual relationship between the lender and the borrower. It only comes into effect when there is a default.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The three cases which the learned trial judge had relied on had nothing to do with the security documents. These cases relate to primary contractual documents and the terms of its breach. The case of <i>Abdul Rahim Abdul Hamid</i> dealt with contractual relationship and terms of the agreement which may trigger an implied duty to take reasonable skill and care in executing customers' orders. The Federal Court in that case <i>inter alia</i> held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The case of <i>Bank Utama</i> also did not deal with 'security documents' and/or collateral. The issue relates to a primary contractual document and the consequence of its breach. The Court of Appeal on the facts <i>inter alia</i> held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The case of <i>Go Dante Yap</i> also has nothing to do with security documents. The contractual breach relates to primary contractual documents. On the facts, the Singapore Court of Appeal <i>inter alia</i> held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The principles stated in the above three cases are well established principles in respect of primary contractual documents. The learned trial judge, in attempting to use the three cases as an analogy for 'security documents', is like comparing an apple with an orange. Such an analogy, if sustained by this court, will create chaos to contractual relationships relating to 'security documents'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To Assignment In Malaysia</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> To appreciate the problem in hand the jurisprudence relating to assignments in relation to landed property as well as chose in action (intangible property) has to be revisited in the right perspective within the parameters of the development of case laws in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> An assignment in the context of real and personal property (chose in action) generally means a transfer of rights by the legal and/or beneficial owner (assignor) in real or personal property to another person (assignee). The assignee becomes the legal and/or equitable owner of the property. This mode is executed by way of a deed of assignment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Under our Torren System, legal rights in landed property cannot be transferred just by a deed of assignment. It has to go through the process of registration in the land office and finally the title of the landed property must be endorsed with the assignee's name to state that the assignee is the legal owner of the property. The assignee's name, when endorsed in the title, will acquire a right <i>in 'rem'</i> in the landed property. If his name is not endorsed, he will only have an equitable interest in the landed property and if he wants to perfect his equitable right to legal right he must go through the process set out in the National Land Code or seek the assistance of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> For example, if a registered and legal owner of landed property who has misplaced his title to the land wants to sell the property immediately for cash he can do it by way of a deed of assignment and by giving an irrevocable power of attorney (to give all rights of the assignor) to the assignee to perfect the title, ie by getting it registered in the land office by complying with the procedure set out in the National Land Code, Stamp Act, etc; or by recourse of seeking the assistance of the court. In this example, the notice procedure of the assignment is irrelevant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> An example, where the notice procedure becomes relevant in banking facilities, and is often used, is in a case where a property is purchased from a developer who holds a master title and agrees to sell the property to various purchasers with an undertaking that the developer will secure individual titles for the purchasers. The purchaser, in order to secure a loan from a bank to finance the property, as a security for the loan, will, by a deed of assignment, assign the property purchased to the bank. But that does not mean the purchaser has transferred the property to the bank and that the bank can deal with the property in any manner as it deems fit. Whether it is an equitable assignment or an absolute assignment or a legal assignment, usually, under the facility agreement the bank will be obliged to reassign the property to the purchaser without default and upon payment of the facility sum. That is to say the right to redemption is an entrenched right. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_420;"><i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 420</LINK>; [1998] 3 MLJ 97; [1999] 2 CLJ 917; [1995] 3 AMR 2331, the Federal Court had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> What must be said here is the law requires the notice of assignment to be given to the developer pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956 (CLA)</LINK> failing which in the event of default of the loan the bank will not be able to get a good equitable title to sell the property to a third party by private treaty and/or public auction and secure a good title for the intending purchaser. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">Section 4(3) of the CLA</LINK> states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The problem in the above example of assignment will arise when the developer fails to fulfill its obligation under the sale and purchase agreement in not building and/or completing the construction of the property. Is the obligation on the bank to sue the developer? Or, must it be on the purchaser? As it stands, the courts have said that the purchaser upon entering into a deed of assignment will not have locus to sue and must get the consent from the bank to sue. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_477;"><i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 477</LINK>; [1984] 2 MLJ 268; [1985] CLJ 231, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_141;"><i>Hipparion (M) Sdn Bhd v. Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 141</LINK>; [1989] 2 MLJ 149; [1989] 1 CLJ 41, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_128;"><i>Phileoallied Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v. Bupinder Singh Avatar Singh &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 128</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 513; [2002] 2 CLJ 621; [1999] 3 AMR 3086 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_1;"><i>Berjaya Times Square Sdn Bhd v. M-Concept Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 597; [2010] 1 CLJ 269; [2010] 2 AMR 205]. What the courts have not said so far is that the bank has a duty to sue the developer and protect the interest of the purchaser. The net effect of the High Court's decision in the instant case, though it is not related to landed property, if sustained, will mean that the bank has a duty to sue. That has not been part of our jurisprudence and/or semblance of jurisprudence in England and/or other Commonwealth jurisdiction, when the deed of assignment forms part of a security document.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> A deed of assignment relating to 'chose in action', such as the instant case, strictly must comply with the notice procedure for it to be effective. A difficulty in 'chose in action' assignment will arise when at the date of assignment the debt has not been crystallised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> For example, where A owes B RM1 million and B assigns the said sum to C and has given proper notice of assignment, then A is obliged to pay the RM1 million to C and not to B and in default C can sue A for the said sum. The law here is quite straightforward.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> However, when A (developer) does not owe B (contractor) currently but will be liable to pay B for the work done in the future based on a building contract, then the debt has not crystallised. In practice B can still assign his rights to the purported proceeds under the building contract to C. That does not mean C can sue A immediately. And even if B has completed the work as per the contract but not to the satisfaction of A, that does not mean A must pay C based on the Deed of Assignment. In such instance, it will be evidentially difficult for C to prove that B has done the work without the assistance of B.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The instant case relates to a chose in action as stated above and when it was assigned the debt has not crystallised. However, the learned trial judge had held that there is an implied contractual duty on the bank to sue and recover the sum when evidentially the bank may never be able to establish its claim. There are no decided cases where courts in similar circumstances had held that the bank is obliged to sue when the Deed of Assignment was given purely as a security for the facility, and that too, an inchoate chose in action where the debt has not crystallised at the date of assignment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The real issues in the instant case are whether the relevant assignment deeds and the Power of Attorney will, in law, place an obligation on the bank to act to recover the proceeds contractually and/or as a fiduciary and whether the learned trial judge in essence, can dismiss the claim of the bank when the issue of liability is not in dispute and when the said sum of RM1 million which the learned trial judge says had been wrongly taken into account is not part of the claim of the appellant; and whether the learned trial judge can rule that the certificate of indebtedness is bad and not sustainable in law when there is sufficient evidence to support the certificate of indebtedness and when the defendant's defence is silent as to the issue of quantum; and whether the demand procedure against the guarantors was duly complied with according to law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We have read through the relevant evidence and contrasted it with the appellant's as well as the respondents' submission. We find merit in the appellant's complaint.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We have read the appeal records and the submissions of the parties in details. We take the view that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment against the bank must be set aside and the claim of the bank must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> From the available authorities only upon default of the borrower, the securities become enforceable and there is no legal obligation to enforce the securities immediately upon default. We have perused the facility agreement, and the security documents several times, and we are not able to find any provision that stipulates that, upon default of Worthy or other parties, the bank must act immediately upon the security documents and/or was obliged in law to act upon the instruction of Worthy to realise their debts through the security documents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In the instant case, it is not in dispute that Worthy did not give 'notice of assignment' in the manner as per the form agreed by the parties, as set out in the First Schedule to the Deed of Assignment of Contract proceeds. Neither was there evidence to say the lender had consented to the variation of the notice of assignment. The relevant clause of ss 2 and 3 in the Deed of Assignment is found at p 641 of the Appeal Record and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It is our considered view that the Assignment Notice was not in compliance with ss 2 and 3 stated above. In consequence, the Assignment is bad in law and the learned trial judge should not have spent much judicial time to give life to a 'sterile assignment' without strict satisfactory evidence that the provisions of ss 2 and 3 have been complied with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It must also be emphasised that the Deed of Assignment which is intended as a security document, does not prohibit the assignor (Worthy) from obtaining the consent from the assignee to sue the debtor and it has been the accepted practice and have obtained judicial recognition. The Malaysian jurisprudence has been explained in <i>Janab's Key To Civil Procedure</i> (2012) 5th edn at pp 147 and 148, in detail. A part of the relevant pages read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The cases such as (i) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_477;"><i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 477</LINK>; [1984] 2 MLJ 268; [1985] CLJ 231; (ii) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_141;"><i>Hipparion (M) Sdn Bhd v. Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 141</LINK>; [1989] 2 MLJ 149; [1989] 1 CLJ 41, all recognise the right of the assignor to sue independently of the right of the assignee. That is to say, the assignor's right to sue is protected and there is no necessity in law or equity to find fault with the bank when Worthy itself could have sued with the consent of the bank, or could have made the bank one of the defendants. The learned trial judge, with respect, had failed to consider this part of the jurisprudence relating to assignment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In our considered view the assignment is bad in law and in consequence, the judgment against the bank for the sum of about RM13 million, etc cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> It is also clearly the intention of the parties that the Deed of Assignment, etc are continuing security and were never meant to be the primary contractual documents. This is set out in s 5 of the Deed of Assignment found at Appeal Record, Part C vol 1 p 641, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In the instant case, it is not in dispute that Worthy did not give 'notice of assignment' in the manner as per the form agreed by the parties, as set out in the First Schedule to the Deed of Assignment of Contract proceeds. Neither was there any evidence to say the lender had consented to the variation of the notice of assignment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In the instant case, the learned trial judge ought to have allowed the bank's claim against Worthy and the guarantors anchored as a counterclaim based on the pleadings, evidence and the law. We note no evidence was adduced by Worthy or the guarantors of the disputed sum relating to the facility agreement which they have to pay. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_185;"><i>Syarikat Telekom Malaysia v. Business Chinese Directory Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 185</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 692; [1997] 1 CLJ 596; [1997] 2 AMR 1191, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We have perused the evidence and the pleadings and we are satisfied the demand notices on the guarantors were served according to law and the submission of the bank on this issue has merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In consequence, the appeal is allowed and the judgment against the bank by the High Court is set aside. In addition, the counterclaim of bank against Worthy and the guarantors is allowed as per prayers 35.1, 35.2 and 35.3 with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
