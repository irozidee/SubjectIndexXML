    <p>The accused was charged and tried in the High Court on one count of murder. He was accused of killing his purported creditor. Property belonging to the deceased victim was found in the possession of the accused. At the close of the prosecution's case, the trial judge held that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established and called the accused to enter his defence. The accused gave a dock statement and admitted to the fact that during a quarrel the victim was injured. At the end of trial, the High Court convicted the accused and sentenced him to death. The accused appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Once property belonging to a victim (the deceased) is recovered from the accused and nexus to the murder weapon and the accused is shown; some level of culpability is attached to the accused, even though such evidence may stand only as circumstantial evidence pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114 Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, to attract at least a <i>prima facie</i> case. (para 9)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The duty of the appellate court <i>inter alia</i> is to look at all evidence adduced and be satisfied whether it is safe to convict. In the instant case, the 'dock statement' itself would stand as judicial admission or confession sufficient for the appellate court to rule that it was safe to convict. (para 13(i))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was sufficient material to support the charge. The view taken by the trial court on the relevant issues was a reasonable view of the evidence on record, and the court had followed <i>Radhi</i>'s direction and rightly applied the maximum evaluation and beyond reasonable doubt test. (para 13(ii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The decision was a safe decision and appellate intervention was not warranted. The appeal had no merit. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b>
      <b>(Observation)</b> Counsel are officers of court and have a duty to assist the court candidly. They are obliged to put up the best defence in law and not suppress in their submissions the relevant facts and law the court has to consider before coming to a just conclusion. (para 8)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's appeal in respect of conviction and sentence of death for the murder of Tan Teng Lin came up for hearing on 12 August 2014 and upon hearing we dismissed the appeal. My learned brother Azahar Mohamed JCA and learned sister Aziah Ali JCA have read the judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant was charged as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It is well settled that it is in the hands of the trier of facts to assess the quality of evidence and to determine whether the evidence on record justifies a conviction. In so doing if the court orders an acquittal or conviction it cannot be set-aside by the appellate court unless it records a finding that the view taken by the trial court was not a possible reasonable view of the evidence on record. [See <i>Pramod Mandal v. State of Bihar</i> [2004] 4 LRI 24].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The petition of appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Even though the petition of appeal is lengthy the issues are straight forward, more so when the death of the deceased has nexus to the appellant. And the appellant in the dock statement at p 206 has stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The deceased is said to have given a loan to the accused and was pestering him for repayment on several occasions. The final and the fatal occasion was the day when the accused injured the deceased with a knife which led to the death of the deceased. The accused gave a 'dock statement' and admits to the fact that during a quarrel the deceased was injured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned trial judge had written a 61 page judgment setting out the facts and law comprehensively. We do not think it is necessary to set out the facts in any detail as the incident, parties and the injury is not in dispute. Further, the learned counsel for the appellant has limited the submission to that there was no <i>prima facie</i> case and defence ought not to be called. The appellant's line of submission is well reflected in the petition of appeal and no other form of defence under the law was raised to reduce the charge at least to manslaughter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It must be noted that the learned counsel in a lengthy written submission was very passionate to canvass that there was no <i>prima facie</i> case, relying on technical issues and not addressing the court that property belonging to the deceased was found in the possession of the accused and evidence was given to say the suspected murder weapon was recovered with the assistance of the accused. <b>We must remind that counsel are officers of court and have a duty to assist the court candidly and are obliged to put the best defence in law and not suppress in the submission the relevant facts and law the court has to consider before coming to a just conclusion</b>. [Emphasis Added].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It must not be forgotten once property belong to deceased is recovered from the accused and nexus to the murder weapon and the accused is shown; some level of culpability is attached to the accused, even though it may stand only as circumstantial evidence pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114 Evidence Act 1950</LINK> to attract at least a <i>prima facie</i> case. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2014_126;"><i>PP v. Shahrael Amir Suhaimi</i> [2014] MLRAU 126</LINK>; [2014] 7 CLJ 380, sitting with Abdul Malik Ishak JCA and Azahar Mohamed JCA, I had the opportunity to deal with jurisprudence relating to circumstantial evidence in great detail. And <i>inter alia</i> I had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> At the close of the prosecution case, the appellant had submitted no <i>prima facie</i> case and the learned trial judge had set out the submission in the grounds of judgment and it can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The learned trial judge had also set out the prosecution grounds for asserting that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established. The grounds can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned trial judge had given lengthy grounds to justify for defence to be called. It is sufficient if we produce two paragraphs which read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have read the appeal record, petition of appeal and the submission of the parties. We are grateful for the comprehensive submission. After much consideration to the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant, we take the view the appeal must be dismissed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We are of the considered view that it is a safe decision and appellate intervention is not warranted and the appeal has no merit. Accordingly we dismiss the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
