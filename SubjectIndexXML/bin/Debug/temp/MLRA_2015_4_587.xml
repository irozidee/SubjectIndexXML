    <p>The 1st and 2nd respondents had retained the appellant - an advocate and solicitor - to act for them in an accident claim. They complained to the Disciplinary Board of the Bar Council ("DB") that the appellant had only given them RM1,000.00 out of a settlement of RM65,000.00. The appellant gave this sum of RM1000.00, after deductions made for loans, taken by the 1st and 2nd respondents from the appellant. Following a request for and receipt of a written explanation from the appellant, the DB appointed a Disciplinary Committee ("DC") to investigate the complaint. The DC found the appellant liable for compromising his position as an advocate and solicitor and recommended that he be suspended for a period of two months. The DB disagreed with the DC's recommendations on punishment and wrote to the appellant to appear and make representations before the DB before it made any order. However, the appellant failed to appear before the DB despite being informed and notwithstanding several postponements to enable him to attend. The DB subsequently made an order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103D.;;">s 103D of the Legal Profession Act 1976 ("the Act")</LINK> that the appellant pay a penalty of RM50,000 to the Discipline Fund within one month and in default thereof, the appellant be suspended from practice until the penalty be paid. The appellant appealed to the High Court but his appeal was dismissed. The High Court was of the view <i>inter alia</i>, that since the appellant had failed to appear before the DB and present his defence, he could not come and complain to the High Court. He chose to absent himself and the High Court would not interfere with the decision of the DB. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court was, on the facts, right to decide as it did. There was no reason to disturb its findings and decision. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> On the facts of the instant case, the appellant was in fact deducting loan sums from the damages awarded for the benefit of third party lenders. It was quite alarming to hear such an arrangement was nothing out of the ordinary as suggested by the appellant's counsel. (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appeal was without merits and ought to be dismissed. The appeal did not come within the exception of a rare and exceptional case warranting the court to interfere with the decision of the DB. (para 17)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, an Advocate and Solicitor of the High Court of Malaya, appealed against the order of the High Court dated 25 February 2014 which dismissed his appeal to the High Court against the order of the Disciplinary Board ("DB") dated 18 January 2013 made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103D.;;">s 103D of the Legal Profession Act 1976 ("the Act")</LINK>, reading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On the facts of this appeal, the Disciplinary Board agreed with the recommendations of the Disciplinary Committee ("DC") on liability but differed from it on the question of punishment. The DC had recommended a punishment of suspension from practice for a period of two months. The DB's order was for the appellant to pay a penalty of RM50,000.00 to the Discipline Fund within one month, failing which the appellant would be suspended from practice until payment of the penalty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We unanimously dismissed the appeal, finding it to be without merits and the grounds advanced by appellant's counsel touched on a well-trodden area, where case authorities have made it very clear that in matters involving the discipline of the legal profession, it is best for the affected advocate and solicitor to be judged by his own peers through the statutory mechanisms mandated by the Act. The court can interfere but only in rare and exceptional cases, as stated by this Court of Appeal, for instance, in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_208;"><i>Gana Muthusamy v. Tetuan LM Ong &amp; Co</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 208</LINK>; [1998] 3 MLJ 341; [1998] 4 CLJ 878; [1998] 4 AMR 3391:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As for the background facts, the 1st and 2nd respondents had lodged a complaint to the DB against the appellant, alleging that the appellant had only given them RM1,000.00 as the payment of damages out of RM65,000.00 which was awarded, being the settlement sum from the insurance company arising from an accident case involving the 1st and 2nd respondents. It was also alleged that the sum of RM1,000.00 was only released by the appellant after deducting all the loans taken by the 1st and 2nd respondents from the appellant. The 1st and 2nd respondents feeling cheated, thus lodged a complaint with the DB on 14 May 2009. The DB wrote to the appellant to request for his written explanation which he provided on 26 August 2009. The written explanation from the appellant was then forwarded to the 1st and 2nd respondents. The 1st respondent's comments were received on 24 September 2009, and thereafter the DB appointed the DC to investigate the complaint.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The complaint was heard by the DC on 26 August 2010 and 14 October 2011. The appellant and the 1st respondent were present at the hearing. The 2nd respondent/complainant had withdrawn her complaint at the commencement of the hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> After investigating the complaint, the DC came to the following finding:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The DC found the following facts established:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant was found liable for compromising his position as an Advocate and Solicitor in the manner stated earlier and the DC recommended that he be suspended for a period of two months.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> However, the DB disagreed with the DC's recommendation on the punishment to be imposed on the appellant. The DB wrote to the appellant to inform him of this and requested him to appear before the DB and make his representations to the DB on 3 November 2012 before the DB made any order. On the evidence, three chances were given to the appellant to be present before the DB to make his representation on 3 November 2012, 8 December 2012 and 18 January 2013 but the appellant failed to be present on any of the given dates.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The meeting of the DB on 18 January 2003 was preceded by a letter dated 26 December 2012 sent to the appellant in which the appellant was informed that he was to appear on 18 January 2013, with a warning that if he did not, the DB would proceed to consider the complaint in his absence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant was again absent on 18 January 2013. The DB then proceeded to consider the complaint and the report of the DC in his absence and made an order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103D.;;">s 103D of the Act</LINK> that the appellant pay a penalty of RM50,000.00 to the Discipline Fund within one month and in default thereof, the appellant shall be suspended from practice until payment of the penalty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Aggrieved by the decision of the DB, the appellant filed an appeal to the High Court. Nevertheless, as we indicated earlier, that appeal was dismissed by the learned High Court Judge with no order on costs, however.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The High Court, in explaining the dismissal of the appeal, held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The High Court was right to decide as it did, and we saw no reason to disturb the findings and decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> During the hearing of the appeal before us, counsel for the appellant attempted to explain his client's absence at the hearing of the DB despite the reminders sent, by simply arguing his client had migrated to Canada. With respect, we found this reason to be more a lame excuse and unconvincing. Counsel further argued that there was "no shred of evidence" that his client had lent money on interest or was in the business of money lending. In response to our promptings, counsel even suggested that there was nothing wrong for a loan to be given to a needful client in the course of pursuing a case. On the facts of this case, the appellant was in fact deducting loan sums from the damages awarded for the benefit of third party lenders. It is quite alarming to hear this sort of arrangement is nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> For the DB, counsel argued that it was for the DB to decide on misconduct and no specific rule was mentioned by it in coming to its decision, to be met with the response from appellant's counsel that no reasonable tribunal would have come to that decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Having heard both parties (the appellant and the DB, the other respondents not appearing in this appeal), we found the appeal to be without merits and thus dismissed it, but, like the High Court, we made no order on costs. This appeal did not come within the exception of a rare and exceptional case warranting the court to interfere with the decision of the DB. On the facts, there was no one else to be blamed for his predicament except the appellant himself.</p>
