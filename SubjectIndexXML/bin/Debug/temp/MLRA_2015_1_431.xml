    <p>The respondents were members of the Special Action Unit of the Royal Malaysian Police Headquarters at Bukit Aman, Kuala Lumpur. They were charged for the murder of a Mongolian woman named Altantuya Shaariibu ('the deceased') under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302of the Penal Code</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> of the same. One Abdul Razak Baginda ('Baginda') was also charged with the respondents for the abetment of the murder. The crime was found to have been committed at a forest area in Puncak Alam, Selangor. The police discovered fragments of human bone, hair and tissue at the crime scene. A DNA analysis established the remains thereof to be that of the deceased with the cause of death being probable blast related injuries. Baginda was acquitted and discharged without his defence being called. The prosecution did not file an appeal against his acquittal and discharge. The respondents, however, were convicted and sentenced to death at the end of the trial. Being aggrieved, the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal, which unanimously allowed their appeal and acquitted and discharged them. The prosecution now appealed. The issues for determination were: (i) whether a copy of a station diary, D428, recording an entry that the 1st respondent was collecting a Glock pistol in Bukit Aman at the material time corroborated his plea of alibi; (ii) whether call logs P27, P370 and P372B establishing calls made by the 1st respondent via his mobile telephone from the scene of the crime rendered the defence of alibi unsustainable; (iii) whether information obtained from the respondents pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> ('the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information') leading to the location of the crime scene and the discovery of the deceased's jewellery in the 2nd respondent's house was admissible; (iv) whether there was suppression of material evidence; and (v) whether there was common intention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal erred in finding that D428 was admissible <i>per se</i> and already proved. The evidence of the investigating officer PW75 pertaining to it did not establish the truth of its content, as he was not the maker of the entry recorded therein. Only the maker could confirm the truth of the entry and unless proven by the maker, the contents of D428 remained hearsay. That apart, the call logs established that the 1st respondent was at the location of the crime scene. Since the call logs were produced by computers in the course of their ordinary use by the very makers, namely PW61, PW62 and PW63, the requirement of tendering to the court signed certificates as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A(2) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> was dispensed with. With the call logs being admissible and D428 not proved, the 1st respondent's alibi defence was rendered unsustainable. It was a mere denial of the murder accusation. (paras 48, 49, 62 &amp; 63)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Both the respondents had knowledge of the location of the crime scene. They led the police team to discover the remains of the deceased. Any <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information would include the accused's statement, his act or conduct, such as pointing out, leading to the discovery of a fact. For such information to be admissible no duty was placed on the prosecution to prove its voluntariness thus dispensing with the requirement of a trial-within-a-trial (<i>Siew Yoke Keong v. PP (refd)</i>). (paras 64-74)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was not established by the 1st respondent as alleged by him that the police already knew the exact location of the crime scene. The evidence of PW19, PW20, PW21, PW58 and PW75 showed that the police did not know the exact location of the crime scene had it not been pointed out by the respondents. In fact, the 2nd respondent's conduct of leading the police to the same scene of crime, separately and independently, merely strengthened the prosecution's case against the respondents. (paras 76-77)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">Section 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> used the word "proved" and no information should be excluded if proved. The issue of discretion to exclude the information obtained pursuant thereto only came into consideration after the prosecution had proved it. In the event it could be shown that the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information had an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings, it could be rejected. The respondents herein had independently led the police to the scene of crime, which was a remote and isolated place high up in the hills, where human remains were found to be that of the deceased. The respondents were policemen from a special force unit and expected not to be easily intimidated. There was also no evidence adduced by them of having been intimidated, induced or tortured in any form by the investigating team. As such, there was no reason to exclude the information in the exercise of the court's discretion. Even if there was some form of untoward behaviour, it did not automatically mean that the court must preclude that piece of evidence. It followed that the trial judge was right in not excluding the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information as evidence. (paras 81-88)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Despite the proved <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information, no explanation or evidence was forthcoming from the 2nd respondent as to how and why the jewellery that belonged to the deceased was found in his jacket in his house. Without any explanation, his possession of the jewellery must have been an unlawful one. His defence, which came in the form of an unsworn statement, failed to account for the jewellery, as it merely stated that his involvement ended outside Baginda's house when he was asked to leave PW7's car. The possession of the jewellery was not only indicative of the offence of theft or possession of stolen property but of any other aggravated crime, in this case the murder of the deceased. At the very least it raised the presumption that the 2nd respondent was present at the crime scene. If no explanation was forthcoming, the presumption then must remain and must pile up as further corroborative evidence to tie down the 2nd respondent to the murder of the deceased. (paras 89-93)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The suppression of material evidence related to the non-calling of one Deputy Superintendant of Police, Musa Safri ('DSP Musa'), and the non-tendering of the SMS messages between the latter, Baginda and the 1st respondent, which found favour with the Court of Appeal. By not calling DSP Musa, the respondents alleged they were deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine him pertaining to the exculpatory contents of the sworn affidavit of Baginda in P436, the failure of which resulted in extreme unfairness to them. The contents of P436 were merely confirmatory in nature and at best useful to Baginda only. It merely confirmed the evidence adduced by PW3 and PW4 that Baginda had a previous relationship with the deceased, that he requested for help from DSP Musa, and affirmed generalised exculpatory remarks beneficial to himself. The calling of DSP Musa, let alone the tendering of the SMS, would not have affected the evidence pertaining to the relationship. Also, DSP Musa did not instruct the 1st respondent to assist Baginda but merely to meet up with him. The 1st respondent thereafter acted on his own discretion and sensibilities. The non-calling of DSP Musa or the non-tendering of all the alleged SMS had not in any way caused unfairness to the respondents. The presumption of adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> was inapplicable. (paras 94-97)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The deceased was last seen alive with the respondents at the Bukit Aman police headquarters. The respondents adduced literally no evidence or explanation that could raise any doubt that they were the last persons to be with the deceased. Cumulatively, by linking all the connective pieces of evidence when the respondents were together to the day when the scene of crime was independently and separately shown by them, the prosecution had established the ingredient of common intention. (paras 107-115)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The prosecution's witnesses and neutral evidence successfully established the antecedents and movements of the respondents. The statements made by the 2nd respondent did not carry much weight either, not because it was unsworn, but because his story was inconsistent with the other cogent evidence tendered in court. In his unsworn statement he said that his involvement with the deceased ended when he left her with the 1st respondent in PW7's car outside Baginda's house. The discovery of the deceased's belongings in his possession and the fact that his car was detected at the Kota Damansara plaza enroute to the crime scene in Puncak Alam, totally discredited his unsworn statement that his involvement ended outside Baginda's house. (paras 120-122)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> With such an abundance of evidence adduced by the prosecution, it was unnecessary to discuss the prosecution's last dissatisfaction of the Court of Appeal's error in refusing to invoke the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. It followed that the respondents failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. After a maximum evaluation, the inescapable conclusion based on the circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution was that the prosecution had successfully proven its case beyond reasonable doubt as per the charge. (paras 123-124)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Suriyadi Halim Omar FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The respondents were jointly charged with the murder of a Mongolian woman named Altantuya Shaariibu (the deceased), under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>, read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the same Code</LINK>. The offence was alleged to have been committed between 10.00pm on 19 October 2006 and 1.00am on 20 October 2006 at a place between Lot 12843 and Lot 16735, Mukim Bukit Raja in the district of Petaling in the State of Selangor Darul Ehsan. One Abdul Razak Baginda (Baginda) was also charged with the respondents for abetment of the murder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It was not disputed by the appellant that the 1st respondent had sent a notice of alibi (D430) to the appellant pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;402A.;;">s 402A of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> (pre-amendment). This piece of evidence was introduced at the prosecution's stage, ie when the investigation officer (PW75) was giving evidence. As requested by the 1st respondent, PW75 also introduced the entry of a station diary as ID (D) 428 (p 3310 Jilid 2 a, e), and after a protracted argument the entry was marked as D428. If proved, D428 would corroborate the plea of alibi of the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> After a maximum evaluation of the appellant's evidence, the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant had established a <i>prima facie</i> case, and accordingly called for the defence of the respondents. On the other hand, Baginda was acquitted and discharged at this stage. No appeal was filed by the Public Prosecutor against that acquittal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At the end of the trial, after a maximum evaluation of the evidence, which took into account the defence posed by both the respondents, the trial judge found the defence raised to be equivalent to mere denials. The trial judge found the plea of alibi unproved by the 1st respondent whilst the 2nd respondent's unsworn evidence was found as ineffective. As no reasonable doubt had been created over the prosecution's case they were accordingly convicted for murder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Being aggrieved the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal unanimously quashed the convictions of both the respondents and had them acquitted and discharged. The acquittals of both the respondents led to this appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submission Before Us</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Evidence was adduced to show that Baginda had a failed affair with the deceased and consequently facing its repercussion. When it ended, the deceased came to Malaysia on 8 October 2006 to demand money from Baginda. She flew down together with her second cousin, one Namiraa Gerelmaa (PW3), and a friend called Urintuya Gal-Ochir (PW4). These two witnesses unfolded the chequered history of Baginda with the deceased, and of her purpose in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Baginda then hired the services of a private investigator (PW1) to keep an eye on the deceased's movement and activities and also to guard his house and family. As Baginda's house was located at Damansara Heights, and falling under the jurisdiction of the Brickfields police jurisdiction, he then sought the assistance of one Deputy Superintendent of Police Musa Safri (DSP Musa), the ADC to the then Deputy Prime Minister, to introduce him to the Officer in Charge of the Police District (OCPD) of Brickfields.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> As the 1st respondent was tasked with the duty of patrolling the area where Baginda's house was located, DSP Musa requested the 1st respondent to meet Baginda (p 5626 exh 436). This, the 1st respondent did, and Baginda met him. Baginda informed the 1st respondent that the deceased stayed at Hotel Malaya, Kuala Lumpur and gave him her room number (see P80A). The 1st respondent, having requested the 2nd respondent to assist him, together went to Hotel Malaya on 18 October 2006. They went immediately to the eighth floor where the deceased's room was located. Nothing came out of that visit except that for their images were caught on the CCTV system, tendered as P48 A-H, and accepted by the trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At that material time, the 1st and 2nd respondents were members of the Unit Tindakan Khas (UTK) or the Special Action Unit of the Royal Malaysian Police at Bukit Aman, Kuala Lumpur with the rank of inspector and corporal respectively with the 1st respondent being the senior officer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 19 October 2006 the deceased went alone to Baginda's house where she met PW1. PW1 had earlier been instructed to stall her until the police came. Soon after, the respondents together with PW7 arrived in her car. From the evidence of PW7 (see p 345 of Jilid 2 d) she went with the 1st respondent to Baginda's house after 8.10pm. Incidentally PW7 was the 1st respondent's girlfriend. On arrival at Baginda's house, PW1 who was standing next to the deceased, saw the 1st respondent alighting. The 1st respondent then approached the deceased, and after a brief conversation, left together with her, 2nd respondent and PW7 in PW7's car. That was the last time that PW1 saw the deceased. From PW7's evidence, chronologically after leaving Baginda's house they ended up at Bukit Aman, at which place she left the respondents together with the deceased. The deceased died that same night or early part of the morning of 20 October 2006 at the place as stated in the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 20 October 2006, after realising that the deceased was missing PW3 lodged a missing person police report. The investigation officer (PW75), on instruction, initiated a kidnapping investigation. On 1 November 2006, the 1st respondent after being identified by PW1 as the person who took away the "Chinese woman" was arrested. A mobile telephone together with three SIM cards were seized from the 1st respondent. The next person to be picked up in the course of the investigation was PW7.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 6 November 2006 the 2nd respondent was arrested. Evidence was adduced by the prosecution to establish the additional piece of evidence that the 1st respondent led the police to discover the scene of the crime; separately and independently the 2nd respondent also led the police to the same spot. The scene of the crime was a forest area of Puncak Alam, Selangor located within Lots No 12843 and 16735, Bukit Raja, Petaling. There the police discovered fragments of human bone, hair and tissue. A DNA analysis established that the remains were that of the deceased, with the cause of death being "probable blast related injuries", as testified by the forensic pathologist (PW70).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The investigation did not end there. As stated earlier, the police also obtained footage of the images of both the respondents being caught on the CCTV system (P48 A-H) of Hotel Malaya, ie the hotel where the deceased stayed. From the 1st respondent's possession was discovered a note (P80A) written by Baginda on which was written the room number of the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Investigation was carried out on call logs from the mobile telephone seized from the 1st respondent, showing the telephonic contacts of the 1st respondent and his traceable position and movement from Baginda's house to Bukit Aman, and thereafter to Puncak Alam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The 2nd respondent also supplied information that led to the discovery of jewellery (earring, watch and ring) belonging to the deceased, in his black jacket, in his house. Again this damning piece of evidence would not have been discovered from his jacket had that specific information not come from him. Such expensive items belonging to the deceased could not have been in possession of the 2nd respondent, in his house, unless they were taken away from her without permission. He had no business keeping them. The DNA analysis of the jewellery confirmed them to belong to the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> A smart tag device with a Touch &amp; Go card was found in the 2nd respondent's car. The record of its usage was tendered in order to show the movement of the 2nd respondent on the night when the deceased disappeared. The record showed that the 2nd respondent's car entered through the Kota Damansara toll plaza at 9.57pm and exited Jalan Duta toll plaza at 12.01am on 20 October 2006 (p 1407 jilid 2 m).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The police also found a pair of slippers (exh 153C) smudged with blood stain in the 2nd respondent's car which held the presence of the deceased's DNA. A spent cartridge (exh P185B) was also recovered from the car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In the midst of the prosecution's case the 1st respondent tendered his alibi notice (D430) which was served on the appellant on 24 May 2007. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;402A.;;">s 402A of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> (pre-amendment), where an accused person seeks to put forward a plea of alibi, evidence in support of it shall not be admitted unless at least 10 days before the commencement of the trial a notice in writing of that intended plea was served on the Public Prosecutor. By serving the notice he thus had complied with a statutory requirement, and in the event his defence were called, no suggestion of mere denial or afterthought of this plea could be alleged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As the prosecution must establish a <i>prima facie</i> case before the defence is called, the introduction of a mere notice at that stage may not cause much harm or difficulty to the prosecution's effort but not if that notice has the backing of cogent and admissible evidence. That backing could come from the prosecution's own evidence. Sir John Woodroffe and Syed Amir Ali's <i>Law of Evidence</i> (17th edn) had occasion to author that, "The onus of proving a plea of alibi can be spelt out from the prosecution evidence ..."(see <i>Criminal Trial Advocacy For The Defence</i> by Hisyam Abdullah @ Teh Poh Teik).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In this case the 1st respondent did just that, ie supporting his notice of alibi with the pre-emptive tendering of the entry in the station diary (D428) of the Bukit Aman's UTL control room, through a prosecution witness (PW75). In a gist D428 was supposed to establish the plea that on 19 October 2006 he was at Bukit Aman and not at Puncak Alam, ie the scene of the murder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The appellant on the other hand submitted that, unless D428 is proved by the maker, it would fail to impair the prosecution's attempt to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case. Needless to say, if the respondents succeeded in preventing the prosecution from establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case, the court must acquit the respondents (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;173.;;">s 173(h) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_590;"><i>PP v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 590</LINK>; [2005] 6 MLJ 393; [2006] 1 CLJ 457; [2005] 6 AMR 203 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_6_705;"><i>PP v. Mohd Aszzid Abdullah</i> [2007] 6 MLRH 705</LINK>; [2008] 1 MLJ 281).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The notes of proceedings confirmed that despite having marked the entry as D428 through PW75, the trial judge in no uncertain terms said that it was still subject to proof (p 3351 Jilid 2 a, e). In a word the maker must be called to prove the contents. The trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> From the notes of proceedings there is no dispute that the truth of D428 was never proved at the prosecution's stage. Without any evidence to back up the alibi notice, and further contradicted by the call-logs, the notice remained unsupported. The 1st respondent had thus failed to create a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Considering the evidence, the big picture established by the prosecution shortly prior to the murder of the deceased is as follows. After PW7 had left the two respondents, the last time anyone saw the deceased alive, the respondents together with the deceased, using the 2nd respondent's car, drove away from Bukit Aman towards Puncak Alam. They took the route of Bukit Aman and the Kota Damansara toll plazas (as established by the records of the Touch &amp; Go card) and from there to the crime scene at Puncak Alam. The records showed the 2nd respondent's car passing through those entry and exit points on 19 October 2006 at 9.57pm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The call logs (P27, P370 and P372B), also confirmed them to be at the area of the scene of crime at about the same time and date as per the charge, and not at Wangsa Maju or the office of IPK Bukit Aman. With D428 left unproved the notice of alibi on its own was of no help to the 1st respondent. No evidential weight could be attached to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The cumulative effect of the entire circumstantial evidence was that having given the evidence adduced by the appellant the maximum evaluation the trial judge was satisfied that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been successfully established by the prosecution at the end of its case. Having scrutinised the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the finding of the trial judge, we find that the finding of the <i>prima facie</i> case and calling of the respondents' defences, safe. The acquittal of Baginda at the end of the prosecution's stage is of no concern to us as no appeal had been filed against that acquittal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It is settled law that come the defence stage it is up to an accused person to rebut the <i>prima facie</i> case adduced by the prosecution by merely casting a reasonable doubt (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_91;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Saimin &amp; Ors</i> [1971] 1 MLRH 91</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 16). How he goes about casting that reasonable doubt is left to him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In the circumstances of the case, as the 1st respondent wanted the court to believe that he was somewhere else the burden therefore was upon him to establish that relevant fact. As to why the 2nd respondent preferred to give an unsworn statement is irrelevant to the trial judge or even us. The focus of the trial judge is only the content and weight attached to that unsworn statement. The 2nd respondent was entirely within his legal rights when he elected to make an unsworn statement, but in a case which must in the event depend on credibility he took it at his own peril (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1961_1_642;"><i>Udayar Alagan &amp; Ors v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1961] 1 MLRA 642</LINK>; [1962] 28 MLJ 39). As the 2nd respondent's demeanour could not be gauged, let alone the statement escaped any vigorous cross-examination by the prosecution or could not be tested against the evidence adduced by the prosecution, it is no small wonder that the trial judge refused to attach any weight to his unsworn statement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Even though it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove its case, the legal requirement is on the premise of beyond reasonable doubt, and not beyond a shadow of a doubt (<i>Miller v. Minister of Pensions</i> [1947] 2 All ER 372). As it were, at the end of the trial the respondents were found guilty and accordingly convicted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In essence, the appellant's main dissatisfaction with the Court of Appeal's reasoning for overturning the High Court's decision may be summarised in this manner. The Court of Appeal erred when:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The appellant ventilated to us that based on the evidence, oral and documentary, though circumstantial, it had successfully made out the charge of murder against both the respondents beyond reasonable doubt and prayed that the appeal be allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submission Of The Respondents In A Nutshell</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The 1st respondent in his reply reiterated his non-involvement with the murder and repeated his defence as submitted at the High Court. He submitted that he only took the deceased to Bukit Aman, and after handing over the deceased to the 2nd respondent, his involvement in this case ended. The 1st respondent adverted to his alibi plea by alluding to the notice (D430) served on the appellant on 24 May 2007, and supported by D428 (indicating the physical impossibility to commit the crime). There was no denial by the 1st respondent that he did not call the maker of the entry in the station diary be it at the prosecution or defence stage thus leaving the entry unproved.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The 1st respondent also denied leading the police to the scene of crime and claimed that he was led there instead.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Before us the 2nd respondent again fell back on his unsworn statement given from the dock and likewise denied involvement in the murder of the deceased. Even though he admitted being present when the deceased was picked up at Baginda's house on 19 October 2006, his involvement ceased when he was asked to leave PW7's car, a little distance away from that house. He did not even support the story as alleged by the 1st respondent regarding the handing over of the deceased to him at Bukit Aman. He denied giving any information to the police that led to the discovery of the jewellery or the scene of crime. In short, he claimed that he was being made a scapegoat.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Analysis And View Of The Alleged Errors Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>a) Admissibility Of The Unproved D428 (Entry In The Station Diary)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> As the issue of D428 is relevant to the plea of alibi which was invoked by the 1st respondent a need arises for us to discuss the concept of alibi first. <i>Sarkar on Evidence</i> (15th edn, p 258) states that the word "<i>alibi</i>" is of Latin origin and means "elsewhere". By claiming he was elsewhere he would thus be physically incapable of committing the offence he is charged with. As mere assertion of alibi is insufficient to exculpate himself he thus must adduce credible evidence that can cast a reasonable doubt over the prosecution's case, evidence that must include particulars of the place where he claimed he was at the time of the commission of the offence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In Malaysia this plea of alibi, which is more a rule of evidence rather than a defence in the normal sense, together with the burden placed on the person who asserts that he was elsewhere, can be found in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;11.;;">Section 11</LINK> provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact or if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or a relevant fact highly probable or improbable. Under illustration (a), whether A committed a crime on a certain day and the fact that he was somewhere else, is relevant. Therefore if an accused person, in this case the 1st respondent, states that he was somewhere else, ie he was not at the scene of crime that inconsistent fact is relevant. If successful in establishing his alibi his acquittal should be assured as he could not have committed a crime when he was physically away from the scene of crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The burden of proving the commission of an offence by an accused person never shifts away from the prosecution whilst the burden of establishing that defence of alibi lies on the accused person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Mere service of a notice of alibi on the prosecution is not sufficient to substantiate the truth of such notice even though an accused person does not assume the burden of proving its truth. The burden is still on the prosecution to prove its falsity by evidentially establishing the presence of the accused person of having been at the scene of the crime at the material time. The falsity of that notice will crystalise once the prosecution successfully establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> As said above, if the prosecution fails to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case then the need by the accused person to prove his alibi defence does not arise; but once the prosecution discharges his prosecutorial burden of proof that led to the establishment of the <i>prima facie</i> case, it then becomes incumbent upon the accused person to cast a reasonable doubt that he was elsewhere (<i>Gurcharan Singh &amp; Anor v. State of Punjab</i> [1956] AIR SC 460 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_7;"><i>Dato' Mokhtar Hashim &amp; Anor v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1983] 1 MLRA 7</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 232; [1983] 2 CLJ 10; [1983] CLJ (Rep) 101). This is a heavy burden on the 1st respondent and that burden flows from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;103.;;">s 103 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_448;"><i>Juahir Sadikon v. Perbadanan Kemajuan Ekonomi Negeri Johor</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 448</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 627; [1996] 4 CLJ 1; [1996] 3 AMR 2984). <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;103.;;">Section 103</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> With the passage of time the above rule of evidence, now universally termed 'alibi', is conveniently referred to by law practitioners as 'defence of alibi' (<i>Jayantibhai Bhenkarbhai v. State of Gujarat</i> (SC of India) Appeal (Crl) 555 of 2001). In this case, the 1st respondent when alluding to the defence of alibi, and relying greatly on D428 took the risk of putting all his eggs in one basket. He could not have been unaware that such a defence is fraught with danger. He could not at his whims and fancies at the defence stage introduce or advance an alternative defence, as such an approach would militate against the rule that an accused person must put forward his defence at the earliest possible opportunity. This rule avoids any suggestion of afterthought apart from preventing any element of surprise befalling the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> As D428 was tendered at the prosecution's stage, our discussion of this exhibit must begin from that stage, ie before the defence was called. As the 1st respondent had tendered two exhibits at the prosecution stage <i>viz</i> D430 and D428, and perhaps inadvertently diluting the prosecution's case, and unless this advance defence is neutralised the prosecutor may have a difficulty in establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case. The purpose of the D428 was to establish the 1st respondent's defence that on 19 October 2006 at 10.18pm he was at IPK Bukit Aman, and only left at 10.20pm on account of an escort duty of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Dato' Seri Najib Razak in Putrajaya. The notice of alibi states that he went to Section 4 Wangsa Maju at around 10.25pm until 11.45pm and at about 11.45pm to 12.20am (the next day) he was at Bukit Aman. He left Bukit Aman at 12.20am and reached Putrajaya at 1.00am. In other words at the material time he was never at Puncak Alam, ie the scene of the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The entry (D428) reads as follows:</p>

      <b>[43]</b> On this issue, the Court of Appeal had faulted the trial judge for not addressing his mind on D428, an entry which showed the 1st respondent collecting a Glock at 10.18pm at Bukit Aman. The Court of Appeal also found that the investigating officer PW75 had testified that D428 was a true and an accurate record as provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;97.;;">s 97 of the Police Act 1967</LINK>. And the Court of Appeal accepted its admissibility hence disagreeing with the trial judge as regards this exhibit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In order to discuss the admissibility of D428 a need arises to reproduce <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;97.;;">s 97 of the Police Act 1967</LINK>. It reads:</p>

      <b>[45]</b> D428 is an entry from the station diary as confirmed by PW75 pursuant to the above provision. Counsel for the 1st respondent submitted that the entry was admissible and had relied on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_7;"><i>Dato' Mokhtar Hashim &amp; Anor v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1983] 1 MLRA 7</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 232; [1983] 2 CLJ 10; [1983] CLJ (Rep) 101 to support his proposition. Having perused that case, despite such an entry being part of a public document, it was not automatically accepted as admissible (as opposed to the lock-up register). In that case Inspector Aziz had come forward to testify that he was the maker and also confirming the truth of the fact entered. In the current case that additional step is wanting, ie nobody came forward to prove its authenticity.</p>

      <b>[48]</b> Suffice if we state that we are unable to agree with the Court of Appeal's view that D428 is admissible <i>per se</i> and already proved. We hold that PW75's opinion of the statutory requirement of the station diary, and his confirmation of the similarity of D428 (it being a copy) with the original station diary entry, did not necessarily establish the truth of its contents. He was never the maker of the entry. Only the maker could confirm the truth of the entry and unless proven by the maker the contents of D428 remains hearsay.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> With only a notice of alibi and an unproved D428 to fall back on, as opposed to the prosecution's water tight case, it was no surprise that a <i>prima facie</i> case was established.</p>
    <p>
      <b>b) Admissibility Of The Call Logs (P27, P370 And P372B) And The Effect Of The Unproved D428 Over Them</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In the course of the police investigation the police had seized the 1st respondent's mobile telephone (019-3636153). In order to pin-point his whereabouts on the date and time of the murder the police sought the assistance of Celcom. From the technical assistance of Celcom, the police would know if the said mobile telephone had been used, when and where. Celcom witnesses produced bills, etc of the calls and the print outs of the calls are referred to as call logs (P27, P370, P372B).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> We now discuss the witnesses who produced them in court. We begin with PW61. He is an internal investigator of Celcom and is authorised to produce and print Celcom's clients' information and bills when required by any authority. He also has access to all systems in Celcom for paid and prepaid. On 31 October 2006 PW61 received a few requests from the police to produce and print a detailed bill of mobile phone number 019-3636153 (owned by 1st respondent) for the period of 1 October 2006 until 31 October 2006, one of them produced by him being P27. He prepared and arranged P27. Not only did he personally operate the computer which was under his care but also adduced an unnecessary affidavit to confirm so. This P27 was processed by PW61 personally from raw data (P370) received by e-mail from Mr Syed Mustaqim bin Syed Yusoff (PW62). P27 showed the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> In a nutshell as explained by PW61, P27 showed that on 19 October 2006 a call was made from the mobile phone 019-3636153 at about 10.15pm at Pekan Subang; another call was made at about 10.19pm at Kg Melayu; and two calls made at Puncak Alam at about 10.43pm and 11.16pm. It is common knowledge that Pekan Subang and Kg Melayu are close by to Puncak Alam, and quite a distance from Bukit Aman.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> PW62 confirmed that raw data would initially come from the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) which would later be sent to the Mediation System. Having received that raw data in that Mediation System he had programmed the data into P370, and thereafter had sent them not only to PW61, but also to PW63. PW62 evinced that he was in charge of the Mediation System and stated that P370 was a complete record of the transaction of 019-3636153 (p 2434 RR Jilid 2 w). When asked as regards P27's authenticity, sourced from P370, and produced by PW61, PW62 said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> We now touch on PW63's evidence. He is a university graduate of UITM and has a degree in electrical engineering, employed by Celcom as a technical specialist, to plan and develop for the DG system for its transmitting system. He explained the data relating to site name, Location Area Code (LAC), Cell ID service area code, scrambling code, frequency, etc. He confirmed that he received P370 from PW62 and thereafter prepared and produced P372B with certain minor modifications by switching the header of two columns, namely columns 6 and 7. He received P370 through his own computer and thereafter produced P372B from that same computer (RR 2523 Jilid 2 x). That computer was in good order. He confirmed that the 'value' of P27, P370 and P372B were similar (jilid 2 x p 2567).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> PW63 also testified that based on the value of Location Area Code (LAC) and Cell ID, any transaction, either outgoing or incoming, would indicate the whereabouts of the caller, in this case the 1st respondent as reflected from his mobile telephone. The LAC would indicate the general location of a call whilst the Cell ID would indicate the exact location of the transmitting station thus pinpointing the call spot. With PW63's explanation of P372B drawn from P27, the transactions recorded on 19 October 2006 showed that calls took place on 22:43:06 (10.43pm) and 23:16:46 (11.16pm) at Puncak Alam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> PW63, apart from retrieving and personally preparing P372B from his own computer, had taken the extra mile of conducting a test drive in order to identify the best serving base station. He, together with PW75, and another police personnel, had shown and identified the location of the relevant transmitting station relevant to P372B. He even did a demo as to how he could ascertain the location of the transmitting station which would capture his demo call. He went to Bukit Aman and after making test calls showed that any calls from that site would originate and indicate the transmitting station as Bukit Aman. These demo test calls were additional oral evidence over and above that of P372B to establish that no calls were transmitted from Bukit Aman and Wangsa Maju at the time of the murder from the 1st respondent's mobile phone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> A further perusal of P27 shows a transaction having taken place at 23:26:53 (11.26pm) on 19 October 2006 at BKTASMARA, with the 1st respondent finally returning to BUKIT_AMAN at 12.25am.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Our final conclusion is that the above neutral information of P27, P370 and P372B affirmatively pin-pointed the date, time and place of the caller, ie the 1st respondent every time he made a call. From the analysis of the information as supplied by PW61, PW62 and PW63, not only are we aware of the communications made by the 1st respondent, but also his last position, ie Puncak Alam, after PW7 left them at Bukit Aman. What was obvious too was that none of the calls made by the 1st respondent, when using mobile phone 019-3636153, were detected from Wangsa Maju or Bukit Aman during the material time. The demo carried out by PW63 merely reconfirmed the call logs. It is common knowledge that the distance between Wangsa Maju/Bukit Aman to Puncak Alam, ie the scene of the murder is very far apart. In short, the respondents could not have been anywhere else except at those places as indicated by the call-logs, ie Puncak Alam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(f) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> the court may presume that the common course of business has been followed in the case of the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC). Without any evidence to the contrary we take it that the raw data in the MSC had been stored, maintained and operated properly. As regards the value of the call logs there is no evidence to show that the call logs had been tampered with or had been successfully discredited by the respondents. It must also be emphasised that a technical piece of evidence that is difficult to be understood, is not sufficient ground for it to be rejected, let alone declared as not creditworthy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">Section 90A(2) of the Evidence Act</LINK> demands certain conditions to be complied with, to enable the documents produced by a computer and of statements contained therein, to be admissible. For easy reference we reproduce this provision, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_555;"><i>Gnanasegaran Pararajasingam v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 555</LINK>; [1997] 3 MLJ 1; [1997] 4 CLJ 6; [1997] 3 AMR 2841, the Court of Appeal held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That decision was followed by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_58;"><i>Ahmad Najib Aris v. PP</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 613; [2009] 2 CLJ 800.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In this case, the call logs were produced by computers in the course of their ordinary use by the very makers, namely PW61, PW62 and PW63 hence dispensing with the requirements of tendering to the court signed certificates that they were responsible for the management of the operation of the computers, or for the conduct of the activities for which those computers were used for. The need to adduce the certificates as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A(2) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> had thus become redundant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> With no weight attachable on D428 by no stretch of the imagination could it cast any reasonable doubt on the unimpeachable P27, P370 and P372B. The assertion of the 1st respondent that he was at Bukit Aman, collecting a Glock at 10.18pm and then leaving Bukit Aman for Putrajaya at 10.20pm was without any corroboration. With the call logs being admissible, and making short shrift of the unproved D428, the alibi defence is no better than a mere denial of the murder accusation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>c) <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">Section 27 Information Of The Evidence Act 1950</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> In the instant case the appellant also relied on the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information to prove that both the respondents had knowledge of the location of the crime scene. Evidence was adduced to show that they had led the police team to discover the remains of the deceased. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">Section 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> The trial judge had accepted the admissibility of the statements made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> from the 1st respondent, on the premise that there was no reason to doubt the credibility and reliability of the evidence of C/Inspector Koh Fei Cheow (PW20). Further, PW20 had no prior knowledge of the location of the scene of crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The Court of Appeal on the other hand held that there was doubt as to whether the information leading to discovery was in fact given by the 1st respondent. The Court of Appeal found contradictions between what was said by the 1st respondent as to the location of the scene of the crime after comparing PW20's testimony in court and his police report (P62).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> There was also alleged material contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence given by PW20 and DSP Zainudin bin Abdul Samad (PW21). PW20 had testified that the 1st respondent showed to the police the place where the Mongolian girl was blown up first before proceeding to point where the girl was shot. PW21 on the other hand testified that PW20, the 1st respondent, and the police escort went to the area where the Mongolian girl was shot first, before proceeding to where she was blown up. The only difference was the sequence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> The other contradiction was as regards the exact evidence given by PW29, PW21 and PW75 and what the 1st respondent actually showed to the police team at the crime scene. The respondents submitted that as the accuracy of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information was being challenged it thus should be rejected. On this issue the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_608;"><i>Pang Chee Meng v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 608</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 137; [1992] 1 CLJ 39; [1992] 1 CLJ (Rep) 265 was referred to, where Abdul Hamid LP said at p 610:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The Supreme Court also opined that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> Apart from the alleged contradictions of the testimony of the prosecution's witnesses here, the 1st respondent also alleged that the police had prior knowledge of the crime scene before enlightened by him. The 1st respondent submitted that the forensic team led by Supt Amidon (PW58) was already at UiTM Puncak Alam even before the 1st respondent took them to the scene. In a gist the police already had prior knowledge of the scene from some other sources implying that the entire <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information leading to discovery was staged and fabricated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> On this point, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_230;"><i>Francis Antonysamy v. PP</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 230</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 389; [2005] 2 CLJ 481; [2003] 2 AMR 455 when quoting <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_4_307;"><i>PP v. Hashim Hanafi</i> [2002] 4 MLRH 307</LINK>; [2002] 4 MLJ 176; [2003] 8 CLJ 555 had occasion to remark:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The defence counsel also referred to the Supreme Court case of <i>Pang Chee Meng v. Public Prosecutor (supra)</i> in particular the following remarks made by the Lord President Tun Abdul Hamid:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> The other case for our consideration is <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_694;"><i>Krishna Rao Gurumurthi &amp; Anor v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 694</LINK>; [2007] 4 CLJ 643, where the court also followed the principles enunciated above. The court remarked that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Before commenting on the submission of the 1st respondent as regards the contradictions, let us examine first the recent Federal Court's case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_4_99;"><i>Siew Yoke Keong v. PP</i> [2013] 4 MLRA 99</LINK>; [2013] 3 MLJ 630; [2013] 4 CLJ 149; [2013] 3 AMR 202. In this case it was held that any information to be admissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act</LINK> would include the accused's statement, his act or conduct, such as pointing out, which led to the discovery of a fact. For such information to be admissible no duty is placed on the prosecution to prove its voluntariness thus dispensing with the requirement of a trial-within-a-trial. We see no reason to depart from the above ruling.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> We are of the considered view that the correct test was applied in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1999_3_875;"><i>PP v. Krishna Rao Gurumurthi &amp; Ors</i> [1999] 3 MLRH 875</LINK>; [2000] 1 MLJ 274; [2000] 1 CLJ 446; [2000] 1 AMR 956, as applied in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1977_1_213;"><i>Chong Soon Koy v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1977] 1 MLRA 213</LINK>; [1977] 2 MLJ 78, when Suffian LP formulated a two questions test, <i>viz</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> The above two questions test indicate that the focus is on the supplied fact discovered and not on the extraneous factors to make the information acceptable. Applying the above test to the current case, (as opposed to the first respondent's position), the prosecution's version was that PW20 and PW21 were taken by him to the scene. The 1st respondent never mentioned the word "Puncak Alam" to PW20 and PW21 but had merely brought them to that location. The act of the 1st respondent pointing to the place where the deceased's remains were found amounted to information. That information was the distinct cause of the discovery of the remains of the deceased before the 2nd respondent arrived with another set of officers. We observed that nowhere was it shown or established by the 1st respondent that the police already knew the exact location.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> Having considered the evidence of PW19, PW20, PW21, PW75 and PW58 we are satisfied that the police did not know the exact location of the scene of crime had it not been pointed out by the respondents. The 2nd respondent's conduct of leading the police to the same scene of crime at Puncak Alam, separately and independently, merely strengthened the prosecution's case against the respondents. PW19 testified that he received information from PW75 that the 2nd respondent had also agreed to show the location of the crime scene. And the 2nd respondent brought the police to the same location as shown by the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>d) Discovery Of The Deceased's Jewellery In The 2nd Respondent's Black Jacket In His House</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> Information given by the 2nd respondent also led to the discovery of jewellery belonging to the deceased found in the 2nd respondent's jacket in his house. The DNA analysis carried out on the jewellery confirmed them to belong to the deceased. The 2nd respondent had led ASP Zulkarnain (PW23) and his team together with the Bomb Disposal Unit to his house at No 5-3- 7, which was located at the third floor of a building. Guided by the 2nd respondent PW23 used the key to open the padlock attached to the grill and the wooden door of the said house. PW23 testified that the 2nd respondent led his team to his room and there took out a black jacket from the cupboard in his room. While taking the said jacket out the 2nd respondent told him, "saya simpan barang kemas di dalam jacket". Acting on this information PW23 went through the jacket and discovered a lady's wrist watch carrying the "Larmens" brand engraved with the serial number of 940004B (P16B), a pair of earrings one of which was without a stud (P17B), and one gold ring (P18B). When PW23 asked the 2nd respondent, "Adakah ini barang-barang kemas yang dimaksudkan" the 2nd respondent nodded his head, pointed his finger at the same items and said, "inilah barang dia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> Counsel for the 2nd respondent on the other hand contended that PW20 contradicted PW23 on the discovery of the said jewellery. The latter claimed that the 2nd respondent said, "... sendiri keluarkan jacket tersebut dan memberitahu sesuatu kepada saya ... gambar diambil serentak semasa beliau menunjukkannya". It was at this point that PW23 claimed that the second statement was made, ie "saya simpan barang kemas di dalam jacket". Learned counsel for the 2nd respondent also submitted that a police team had searched the 2nd respondent's room before the jewellery were found.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> Notwithstanding the submissions of the 2nd respondent, and having perused the evidence, we found no fault in the finding of the learned trial judge that the said jewellery were discovered in consequence of the said information supplied by the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">Section 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> uses the word "proved" and nothing should be excluded if the information were proved. In a word, the issue of discretion to exclude that information comes for consideration only after the prosecution has proved it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The 2nd respondent here contended that the said information was procured in breach of the privilege against self-incrimination by not complying with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112(2) and (4)</LINK>, and the information was procured in breach of the mandatory procedure to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112(5)</LINK>. Therefore, it was argued by the defence that even assuming the information was procured, it was not procured by the mandatory adherence of law, resulting in unfairness to the 2nd respondent, and as such the court ought to exercise its discretion to exclude it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> The pertinent evidence highlighted by the respondents are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> Let us briefly look at case law again. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_26;"><i>Goi Ching Ang v. PP</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 26</LINK>; [1999] 1 MLJ 507; [1999] 1 CLJ 829; [1999] 2 AMR 1297, it was held that information supplied under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK>, which has been found to have been given involuntarily, may be excluded by the court in the exercise of its discretion. The Federal Court there quoted <i>Harris v. DPP</i> [1952] 1 All ER 1044, at 1048 with approval, that "... in a criminal case, the judge always has a discretion to disallow evidence if the strict rules of admissibility would operate unfairly against an accused".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> The Federal Court further held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> In <i>Francis Antonysamy (supra)</i> the Federal Court had agreed with <i>Goi Ching Ang v PP (supra)</i> that the information supplied under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK>, which has been found to be involuntary, may be excluded by the court in the exercise of its discretion. But the court there opined that as the exclusion of the evidence is discretionary the exercise of the discretion will depend on the facts of each case. The court there said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> In other words, not all <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> statement will be excluded in all instances where it was supplied involuntarily. In the event it could be shown that the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information obtained has an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings the learned judge could reject it. Again we have no reason to depart from that stance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> Here the respondents had independently led the police to the scene of crime, which is a remote and isolated place and high up in the hills, where human remains were found at that place, subsequently proved to be that of the deceased. They are policemen from a special force unit and are expected not to be easily intimidated, let alone there is no evidence adduced by them of having been intimidated, induced or tortured in any form by the investigating team. From the evidence we find no reason to exclude the information in the exercise of our discretion. But it must be understood that, even had there been some form of untoward behaviour, that does not automatically mean the court must forthwith preclude that piece of evidence. We therefore find that the trial judge was right in not excluding the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information as evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> Despite the proved <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> information no explanation or evidence was forthcoming from the 2nd respondent as to how and why the jewellery that belonged to the deceased was found in his jacket in his house. Without any explanation his possession of the jewellery therefore must have been an unlawful one. His defence, which came in the form of an unsworn statement failed to account for those jewellery, as it merely stated that his involvement ended outside Baginda's house when he was asked to leave PW7's car. Under the illustrations of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(a) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> Matthew CJ in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1955_1_618;"><i>Abdullah Bin Saad v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1955] 1 MLRA 618</LINK>; [1956] 1 MLJ 92 at 619 had occasion to discuss the above statutory presumption in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> It is noteworthy that in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_153;"><i>Amathevelli P Ramasamy v. PP</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 153</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 367; [2009] 3 CLJ 109, Arifin Zakaria CJ (Malaya), as he then was, had occasion to discuss the above <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(a)</LINK> at p 162. The deceased there was wearing a gold chain at the time of her death but was found later in the possession of the appellant. This piece of jewellery was a material element to connect the appellant to the murder of the deceased, which was also supported by other evidence in the like of acid injury found on the appellant's lips and arm. Co-incidentally the deceased also had acid injuries. The appellant failed to explain the possession of the gold chain. Arifin Zakaria CJ (Malaya) stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> At the end of the case Arifin Zakaria CJ (Malaya) stated that the appellant had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case. His Lordship remarked:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> Similarly in the present case, the possession of the jewellery found in the jacket of the 2nd respondent was not explained by the 2nd respondent. Thus the above presumption must remain. The possession of the deceased's jewellery not only is indicative of the offence of theft or in possession of stolen property but of any other more aggravated crime, in this case the murder of the deceased. At the very least it raises the presumption that the 2nd respondent was present at Puncak Alam (see above <i>R v. Rockman</i> [1789] 2 East PC p 1035, and see <i>R v. Fuller</i> [1816] R &amp; R 308). If no explanation is forthcoming the presumption then must remain and must pile up as further corroborative evidence to tie down the 2nd respondent to the murder of the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>e) Suppression Of Material Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> This sub-heading relates to the non-calling of DSP Musa and the non-tendering of the SMS messages between the latter and Baginda and the 1st respondent which found favour with the Court of Appeal. The respondents at the Court of Appeal had alleged that this failure amounted to suppression of evidence resulting in an abuse of process of the court which led to a mistrial. In this regard the respondents relied on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_354;"><i>Ti Chuee Hiang v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 354</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 433; [1995] 3 CLJ 1; [1995] 2 AMR 1879, which emphasised that unfairness could not be cured by merely offering DSP Musa as a witness for the respondents. By analogy, in the above case the court at p 358 observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> By not calling DSP Musa the respondents were alleged to have been deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine him pertaining to the exculpatory contents of P436, ie the sworn affidavit by Baginda. This failure had resulted in extreme unfairness to them. The Court of Appeal agreed with this argument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> Despite the above similar submission before us, we are satisfied that the contents of P436 are merely confirmatory in nature and at best useful to Baginda only. It merely confirmed the evidence adduced by PW3 and PW4 that Baginda had a previous relationship with the deceased, that he requested for help from DSP Musa, and affirmed generalised exculpatory remarks beneficial to himself. As there is no serious dispute about this relationship, we are therefore unable to see how much more details DSP Musa could produce that would contribute to the respondents' defences. The calling of DSP Musa, let alone the tendering of the SMS, would not have affected the evidence pertaining to Baginda's previous relationship one tiny bit. We also observed that DSP Musa never instructed the 1st respondent how to assist Baginda but merely was told to meet up with him; the 1st respondent thereafter had acted on his own discretion and sensibilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> We therefore conclude that the non-calling of DSP Musa or the non-tendering of all the alleged SMS had not in any way caused unfairness to the respondents. We fail to see how the presumption of adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> could be applicable here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>f) Common Intention Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">Section 34 Of The Penal Code</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">Section 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> provides that when a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone. The Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_73;"><i>Namasiyiam Doraisamy v. Public Prosecutor &amp; Other Cases</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 73</LINK>; [1987] 2 MLJ 336; [1987] CLJ 241 at p 84 observed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> It is trite that when <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> is alluded to in a charge for murder, there is no requirement to prove who actually or ultimately caused the death of the deceased (<i>Ong Chee Hoe v. PP</i> [1999] 4 SLR 688). In that case the court opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> The Court of Appeal in its judgment here when addressing the issue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> had remarked the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[101]</b> The respondents submitted before us that there was no evidence from which common intention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> could be inferred between them. Sifting through the evidence, counsel for the respondents canvassed, amongst others, that the records of the smart tag device, showing the movement of the 2nd respondent's car entering and exiting Kota Damansara's toll plaza, did not establish the common intention between the 2nd respondent and the 1st respondent. That was a neutral piece of evidence. Being at Hotel Malaya on 18 October 2006 merely confirmed that the deceased was staying at the hotel. Nothing more should be read into it. Being last seen with the deceased outside Baginda's residence at best merely shows opportunity for the respondents to commit the alleged crime. It was submitted that the gap between opportunity and common intention to commit the offence as per the charge was huge and wide. By no account, it was submitted, were the above pieces of evidence deducible to be common intention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[102]</b> We hold the view that even if the trial judge had failed to mention of any evaluation of common intention in his written grounds of judgment, the Court of Appeal, which in law reheard the case when exercising its appellate function, was empowered and also duty bound to carry out an evaluation exercise to determine whether common intention did exist. Here the Court of Appeal equally failed to do that. An appeal is a continuation of proceedings by way of rehearing and an appeal court may subject the evidence to a critical re-examination (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_58;"><i>Ahmad Najib Aris v. PP</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 613; [2009] 2 CLJ 800 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_602;"><i>Mohamad Deraman v. PP</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 602</LINK>; [2011] 3 MLJ 289; [2011] 3 CLJ 601).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[103]</b> Let us look at the evidence before us that may show the existence of a common intention, if any, as envisaged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> between the respondents to commit murder, with particular emphasis on the respondents being together at a few places and at certain material time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[104]</b> We start with the presence of both the respondents at Hotel Malaya on 18 October 2006, a fact caught on the hotel's CCTV security system as fortified by PW58 who forensically identified the two images as those of the two respondents. Next was the evidence of PW1, confirming the respondents' presence at Baginda's house on 19 October 2006, when the deceased was picked up in PW7's car. These pieces of evidence were never denied by both of them except that the 1st respondent testified that he handed the deceased over to the 2nd respondent at Bukit Aman whilst the 2nd respondent said he last saw the deceased with the 1st respondent outside Baginda's house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[105]</b> A relevant evidential question to be considered on the issue of common intention is whether the respondents had gone up the hills of Puncak Alam in the 2nd respondent's car and whether the car generally played a role in the establishment of their common intention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[106]</b> By establishing that the respondents were in the car together, and eventually ending up at Puncak Alam, not only provided them with time, space and opportunity to formulate the criminal act, but makes short shrift of the assertion of the 1st respondent that his involvement ended at Bukit Aman, and the 2nd respondent's involvement ended outside Baginda's house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[107]</b> Sifting through the evidence, we find that the 1st respondent, when going to Baginda's house on 19 October drove PW7's car together with her. The respondents together with the deceased and PW7 thereafter returned to Bukit Aman. Initially the 2nd respondent sat in PW7's car until they reached a junction where he alighted and switched over to his car, a Vitara (CAC 1883), to return to Bukit Aman. At no stage of the way, in this short episode, was there any mention made of a car owned by the 1st respondent by anyone. At Bukit Aman PW7 left the respondents with the deceased. As said earlier in this judgment (para 24), that was the last time the deceased was seen alive; and the deceased was with the respondents. The respondents adduced literally no evidence or explanation that could raise any doubt that they were the last persons to be with the deceased. How could they raise the doubts when the 2nd respondent had testified that his role ended outside Baginda's house, ie before reaching Bukit Aman whilst the 1st respondent merely stated that after handing over the deceased to the 2nd respondent his role ended. The alleged handing over by the 1st respondent of the deceased at Bukit Aman merely confirmed the testimony of PW7 that the 1st respondent was one of the last two persons (apart from the 2nd respondent) to be with the deceased, when she was alive.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[108]</b> The 2nd respondent's car was seen entering and exiting the Kota Damansara's toll plaza at 9.57pm as confirmed by the records of the smart tag device taken from the 2nd respondent. This neutral evidence established the fact that the 2nd respondent's car had entered and exited this toll plaza, ie the natural route to Puncak Alam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[109]</b> The blood stained slipper found in the 2nd respondent's car, and the discovery of jewellery in his jacket found in his house, could only lead to one irresistible conclusion, ie that the 2nd respondent retrieved them from the deceased at Puncak Alam. The slippers were left in the car whilst the jewellery kept in the house. And the vehicle to transport these items has to be the 2nd respondent's car. Whether these exhibits were taken prior to the killing or otherwise is irrelevant. What is important is that they were taken from the deceased, and to retrieve them, one has to be on that hill in the first place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[110]</b> With the call logs viz P27, P370 and P372B establishing that the 1st respondent had made calls from Puncak Alam the irresistible conclusion is that the 1st respondent was up the hills of Puncak Alam, with the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[111]</b> The 2nd respondent's car has to be the very vehicle that was used to transport the respondents and the deceased to Puncak Alam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[112]</b> The final piece of evidence, like a jigsaw puzzle, is the information received by the police from the respondents, strengthened by them leading the police independently and separately to the scene of crime. By logical deduction they must have been there earlier in order to successfully and unerringly pin-point the location of the scene of crime; with the 2nd respondent's car as the mode of transport. And all the evidence point to the respondents, not only having gone up the hills of Puncak Alam at one point of time, but had gone up with the 2nd respondent's car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[113]</b> With the admissibility and truth of the call logs established it was obvious that the 1st respondent had lied about the alibi defence. His inclination to lie is seen again when he said he handed the deceased over to the 2nd respondent at Bukit Aman; the 2nd respondent denied this.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[114]</b> The discovery of the jewellery from the 2nd respondent's house, showed the untruthfulness of his unsworn statement, ie his involvement having ended at Baginda's house when he was asked to leave PW7's car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[115]</b> Cumulatively, by linking all the connective pieces of evidence when they were together, to the day when the scene of crime was independently and separately shown by them, we are satisfied that the prosecution had established the ingredient of common intention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[116]</b> The prosecution's case rests substantially or entirely on circumstantial evidence. It is trite that direct evidence of the commission of the offence is not the only source from which a trial court can draw its conclusion prior to a finding of guilt. Conviction can be secured based on circumstantial evidence provided that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[117]</b> It is worth noting that the court had this to say in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_5_611;"><i>PP v. Letchumanan Krishnan</i> [2007] 5 MLRH 611</LINK>; [2008] 3 MLJ 290:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[118]</b> Faizal Ali J when delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court in <i>Ram Avtar v. The State (Delhi Administration)</i> [1985] AIR SC 1692, had occasion to state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[119]</b> The above cases have clearly laid down certain guidelines, whereupon in the absence of direct evidence, the prosecution may resort to adducing circumstantial evidence to discharge its burden. Crimes are usually committed in secret and under condition where concealment is highly probable. If direct evidence is insisted under all circumstances, a successful prosecution of vicious criminals, who have committed heinous crimes in secret or secluded places, would be near impossible. In this case not only was the heinous crime committed at a secluded place but the deceased's body was blasted beyond recognition. Only fragments of bones were found.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[120]</b> Without the need to repeat the evidence comprehensively, as adduced by the prosecution and the respondents, suffice if we merely highlight the main ones. The antecedents and movements of the respondents had been successfully established by the prosecution's witnesses and neutral evidence. The discovery of the location of the scene of crime and certain items owned by the deceased came about because of the information obtained from the respondents. With the call-logs establishing that the 1st respondent had made calls from the scene of crime the defence of alibi was unsustainable. By no account he could have been at Bukit Aman or Wangsa Maju at the material time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[121]</b> In fact this alibi defence was a non-starter as he failed to call the maker of D428. By that failure to call the maker to prove the entry, the 1st respondent thus was left high and dry, hence the reason why the trial judge said that his defence was a mere denial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[122]</b> The statements made by the 2nd respondent did not carry much weight either, not because it was unsworn, but because his story was inconsistent with the other cogent evidence tendered in court. In his unsworn statement he said that his involvement with the deceased ended when he left her with the 1st respondent in PW7's car outside Baginda's house. With the discovery of the deceased's belongings, eg the blood stained slipper in his car, the deceased's jewellery found in his house, let alone his car was detected at the Kota Damansara plaza enroute to Puncak Alam, totally discredited his unsworn statement that his involvement ended outside Baginda's house. With a discredited unsworn statement left as a defence the 2nd respondent was as good as left with no defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[123]</b> In the circumstances of the case, with such an abundance of evidence adduced by the prosecution, and the error committed by the Court of Appeal, we find it unnecessary to discuss the appellant's last dissatisfaction of the Court of Appeal's error, when refusing to invoke the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[124]</b> Perusing the evidence as adduced by the respondents, we can safely conclude that the respondents had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. After a maximum evaluation, we are absolutely satisfied, by alluding to the circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution of only one inescapable conclusion, ie the prosecution has successfully proven its case beyond reasonable doubt as per the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[125]</b> We therefore allow the appeal. The Court of Appeal's order is thereby set aside and the order of conviction and the mandatory sentence of death against the respondents by the High Court for the murder of the deceased are restored and affirmed.</p>
