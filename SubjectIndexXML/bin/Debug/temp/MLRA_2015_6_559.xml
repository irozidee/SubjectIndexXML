    <p>This was the public prosecutor's appeal against the decision of the High Court in allowing the respondent's appeal against his conviction and sentence for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 ('PAA')</LINK>, which was punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK>. At the Sessions Court, the respondent was found guilty and convicted accordingly. On appeal to the High Court, the High Court judge held that he was bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad v. PP</i> which held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> was unconstitutional and therefore allowed the respondent's appeal. In this appeal, the issues to be determined were, (i) whether the requirement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1) of the PAA</LINK> to give notice prior to the exercise of the right to assemble peaceably was a 'restriction' within meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(b) Federal Constitution ('FC')</LINK>; (ii) If the answer to (i) was in the affirmative, whether, on a true construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(b) FC</LINK>, there was a further requirement that such 'restriction' should also be a 'reasonable' restriction; (iii) If the answer to question (i) was in the negative, whether the imposition of a criminal sanction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> for the breach of the requirement to give notice was <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(b) FC</LINK>; and (iv) If the answer to question (ii) was in the affirmative, whether the imposition of a criminal sanction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> for a breach of the requirement to give notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1) of the PAA</LINK> amounted to a 'reasonable restriction' within meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(b) FC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal and affirming the conviction and sentence imposed by the Sessions Court):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The rationale for enacting the PAA was to facilitate the exercise of the right under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b) FC</LINK>. Under the PAA, the police had ceased its function as a decision maker. Instead, they assumed the role as a regulator and facilitator for peaceable assembly. Every interest of the citizen must be treated equally. It was settled jurisprudence in public law that rights of one set of citizens could not override the rights of another. Accordingly, if the purposive test was not observed in interpreting the PAA, then plainly the right to assemble peaceably would result in the rights of others to be trampled upon flagrantly. The police would not be able to play their role as facilitators and regulators effectively. Indeed, they may not even be able to prepare adequately to provide protection for those participating in the assemblies. This was a recipe for public disorder and would run counter to the purpose of the PAA. Furthermore, upon a perusal of the international norm in regards to the notice period for a peaceful assembly, the PAA was in accordance with international norms in the imposition of the ten-day notification requirement, as the requirement was to allow the authorities to facilitate the lawful exercise of the right to assemble peaceably. (paras 34, 35, 36, 37 &amp; 52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was nothing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) FC</LINK> that could be construed as prohibiting the imposition of criminal sanction for non-compliance with a ten-day notice. Further, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">art 74 FC </LINK>clothed Parliament with power to legislate. Internal security, which included public order, was within the legislative competence of Parliament under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">List I, Item 3 of the Ninth Schedule of the FC</LINK>. Read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;40.;;">s 40(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>, it was plain that Parliament may criminalise any act. (paras 53 &amp; 57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It is trite law that words are not to be read into any provision of a statute unless without those words, the provision of the statute would be completely meaningless. It is for that reason that the court would not allow a provision of statute to be completely meaningless and therefore read words into it, if need be, to give life to it. However, in this instance, the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b) FC</LINK> was very clear. Therefore, there was no necessity to read the word "reasonable" into it. If the court was to do so, it would have the effect of the court usurping the law-making powers of Parliament. (paras 66-67)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant appeal, the requirement to give notice was not a restriction of a right to assemble <i>per se</i> as the respondent was not charged for being a participant in the peaceable assembly. Rather, he was charged for the failure to obey a federal law, namely, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9 of the PAA</LINK> which required him to give prior notice. In no way was his right to assemble peaceably and without arms thereby affected. Accordingly, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> did not run foul of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) (b) FC</LINK>, and was therefore constitutional, valid and enforceable.

      <b>Raus Sharif PCA, Mohd Zawawi Salleh, Zamani A Rahim JJCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal concerns the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 ("PAA"</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts giving rise to this appeal are these. The respondent was charged in his capacity as an organiser of an assembly, at the Sessions Court, Johor Bahru, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1) of the PAA</LINK>, which is punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the same Act</LINK>. The charge reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The assembly was held at the office of Parti Keadilan Rakyat ["PKR"], Johor Bahru. The respondent had failed to notify the Officer in Charge of the Police District (OCPD) of Johor Bahru Selatan about the gathering within the time stipulated under the PAA, namely, ten days before the date of the assembly was scheduled to be held. This requirement of notification of the assembly is provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9;;">s 9(1) of the PPA</LINK> which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1)</LINK> is penalised by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5)</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondent gave his evidence on oath. His defence may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Sessions Court Judge's Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In deciding whether the respondent was the organiser, the Sessions Court had scrutinised the definition of 'organiser' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;3.;;">s 3 of the PAA</LINK>, and examined the role played by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Sessions Court Judge found that the respondent did fill in and sign the notification P3 and also announced the upcoming assembly using his Twitter feed exh P8 (a to d) and Facebook page exh P9 (a to e), both of which would serve to invite the members or public and likely cause them to attend the assembly. This, according to the Sessions Court Judge, fell squarely within the definition of 'organiser' as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;3.;;">s 3 of the PAA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On the question of the non-calling of Dato' Chua Jui Meng, the Sessions Court Judge found that other than his name appearing in the notification P3, there was no other role played by or action taken by Dato' Chua Jui Meng to warrant him being the organiser. Therefore, Dato' Chua Jui Meng was neither an important witness, nor was his evidence material to the case. The non-production of Dato' Chua Jui Meng had not created any gap in the prosecution's case, nor an adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> could be invoked against the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Sessions Court Judge also found that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;10.;;">s 10 of the PAA</LINK>, the notification required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1)</LINK> must be signed by the organiser and the signature in P3 was the respondent's signature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> At the conclusion of the defence case on 26 September 2013, the Sessions Court Judge found that there was no evidence before the court that Dato' Chua Jui Meng was the organiser of "Program Himpunan Black 505". On the contrary, the role and conduct of the respondent showed that he was the actual organiser. The Sessions Court Judge also found that the respondent had failed to cast any reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. As a result, the prosecution had proved its case against the respondent beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, the respondent was found guilty, convicted as charged and sentenced to a fine of RM6,000.00 and in default thereof, three months' imprisonment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Aggrieved by the decision of the Sessions Court, on 27 September 2013, the respondent filed an appeal to the High Court against the conviction and sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>High Court's Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> After the appeal was heard in the High Court, the decision was reserved. During that period, the Court of Appeal on 24 August 2014 delivered its decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_511;"><i>Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad v. PP</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 511</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 157; [2014] 4 CLJ 944 (<i>Nik Nazmi</i>). The Court of Appeal in <i>Nik Nazmi</i> dealt with the exact same provisions as in the instant appeal. The court declared that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> was unconstitutional. Clearly, therefore, constitutional questions that were raised in <i>Nik Nazmi</i> had a direct bearing on the respondent's appeal in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Before the decision in <i>Nik Nazmi</i>, the appellant (Public Prosecutor), on 3 August 2014, filed a motion vide Criminal Application No: 44-52-08-2014 at the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;84.;;">ss 84</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;85.;;">85 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> to refer questions regarding the constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> to the Federal Court. The High Court, however, refused to refer the matter to the Federal Court. Instead, the High Court proceeded to determine and decide the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The High Court in its decision on 24 August 2014 upheld the findings of the Sessions Court that the respondent had not only submitted the notification but also periodically informed the members about the progress of the assembly through his Facebook account and Twitter. This, according to the High Court, amounted to the respondent informing, arranging and being responsible for the conduct of the assembly within the definition of 'organiser' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;3.;;">s 3 of the PAA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The High Court Judge also found that Dato' Chua Jui Meng could not be considered as an 'organiser' as he had not done anything which could bring him within any of the prescribed acts in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;3.;;">s 3</LINK>, save for the fact his name is stated in P3. Dato' Chua Jui Meng never came forward to the police to say he was the actual organiser when the respondent was being investigated. The High Court Judge held that no adverse inference should, therefore, be invoked against the prosecution for not calling him as a witness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Thus, the High Court Judge found that on the facts, the case against the respondent was made out beyond reasonable doubt. However, His Lordship held that he was bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Nik Nazmi</i> which held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> was unconstitutional. On that ground alone, the High Court allowed the respondent's appeal and set aside the decision of the Sessions Court Judge and ordered that the payment of fine of RM6,000.00 to be refunded forthwith.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> On 25 August 2014, the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal against the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Oral Motion At Court Of Appeal And Reference To The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Before the Court of Appeal, the Deputy Public Prosecutor, by way of an oral motion, applied to refer the constitutional questions to the Federal Court on the constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK>. After hearing the submissions by both parties on 10 October 2014, the Court of Appeal allowed the appellant's oral motion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> During the hearing of the reference at the Federal Court on 30 March 2015, the apex court agreed with the respondent's preliminary objection that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the reference and remitted the matter back to the Court of Appeal. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Questions Of Law</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On the constitutionality points alluded to earlier, four questions of law have been identified for our determination:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Principles On The Interpretation Of Constitution</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> There is always a presumption in favour of constitutionality of statutes. The courts can declare a statute to be an invalid piece of legislation but the burden is upon a person who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In the Indian Supreme Court case of <i>Namit Sharma v. Union of India</i> [2013] 1 SCC 745, it was held that the court should exercise judicial restraint while judging the constitutional validity of the statute. When there is only clear violation of a constitutional provision beyond reasonable doubt that the court should declare a provision to be unconstitutional. Further, even if two views are possible, one making the statute constitutional and the other making it unconstitutional, the former view must prevail. The court must make efforts to uphold the constitutional validity of a statute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> One of the most relevant considerations in determining the constitutionality or otherwise of a statute or any of its provision, is the object and reasons as well as the legislative history of the statute. It would assist the court in arriving at a more objective and justly approach. The reasons for the enactment of the statute are the safest guide to its interpretation. It would be essential for the court to examine the reasons of enactment of a particular provision in order to find out its ultimate impact <i>vis-a-vis</i> the constitutional provisions. In the Indian Supreme Court case of <i>Utkal Contractors and Joinery P Ltd &amp; Ors v. State of Orissa &amp; Ors</i> [1987] 3 AIR SCC 279, it was profoundly put as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Further, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> enjoins a court to interpret a provision of an Act that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act. The same purposive approach applies equally in interpreting the Federal Constitution. In the Court of Appeal case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_23;"><i>Dr Koay Cheng Boon v. Majlis Perubatan Malaysia</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 23</LINK>; [2012] 3 MLJ 173; [2012] 4 CLJ 445 at p 32, it was said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Therefore, it is incumbent upon the court to examine the objective or purpose of the PAA. We have scrutinise the PAA carefully. We found that the purpose of the PAA is to facilitate the exercise of a right granted by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> and not to restrict it. The objects of the PAA are stated in s 2 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is pertinent at this juncture to reproduce the relevant provisions of the PAA which are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As can readily be seen, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;12.;;">s 12 of the PAA</LINK> imposes on the police a positive duty, after receiving the notification, to inform persons who have interests regarding the details of the proposed assembly. And persons who have such interests may inform the police of their concerns or objections which in turn allow the police to impose such restrictions and conditions as permitted by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;15.;;">s 15</LINK>. It follows, therefore, that a reasonable time must be accorded to the police and persons who may have interest, concerns or objections, to register them. If the organiser is aggrieved by any restrictions or conditions imposed, he may appeal to the Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;16.;;">s 16</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;14.;;">s 14(1) of the PAA</LINK>, the police has to respond to the notification under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1)</LINK> within five days stating what restrictions and/or conditions were being imposed but crucially, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?;14.;;">s 14(2)</LINK> if the police does not respond, the assembly may go ahead as proposed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> From the above, it can be seen that the PAA is procedural in nature because nothing therein affects the substantive right to assemble peaceably. The PAA merely sets out a series of procedural steps to be taken to ensure and facilitate the exercise of a constitutional right.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Comparison Between The Police Act And The PAA</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> To put our discussion in its proper perspective, it would be helpful for us to outline a brief comparison between the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;;">Police Act 1967</LINK> and the PAA. This is because, as far as the peaceable assembly is concerned, to a large extent, the provisions of the PAA has replaced the relevant provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;;">Police Act 1967</LINK>, albeit in a more liberal approach. Under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;">Police Act 1967</LINK>, a licence was a condition precedent to a lawful assembly, that is to say, without obtaining a licence, any assembly will be deemed to be an unlawful assembly, even if it was ultimately peaceably held. No such restrictive provision is provided in the PAA. Instead the PAA recognise the right to organise an assembly or participate in an assembly peaceably without arms, except that such right shall not extend to the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;4.;;">s 4(1) of the PAA</LINK>)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Further, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;27.;;">s 27 of the Police Act 1967</LINK>, the police may stop an assembly that was without licence. Stopping an assembly is certainly a deprivation of the right to assemble. Members of that assembly can be ordered to disperse, failing which they may commit an offence. On the other hand, there is no power to stop any assembly under the PAA just for the failure to comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(1)</LINK>, provided the assembly is peaceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;27.;;">Section 27 of the Police Act</LINK> also provides that every person taking part in an assembly held without a licence commits an offence, again reiterating, even if the assembly was peaceable. Under the PAA, only those committing specific breaches causing the assembly to be no longer peaceable would be liable (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;20.;;">ss 20</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;21.;;">21 of the PAA</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Yet <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_344;27.;;">s 27 of the Police Act</LINK> had been held by our courts to be constitutional (eg <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_632;"><i>Madhavan Nair &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 632</LINK>; [1975] 2 MLJ 264, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1992_1_584;"><i>Datuk Yong Teck Lee v. PP &amp; Anor</i> [1992] 1 MLRH 584</LINK>; [1993] 1 MLJ 295; [1992] 2 CLJ 326; [1992] 1 AMR 340 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_511;"><i>Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad v. PP</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 511</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 157; [2014] 4 CLJ 944). In these decisions, despite the imposition of certain conditions to regulate assemblies, yet our courts have held that such conditions do not impinge on the right granted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> As we stated earlier, the rationale for enacting the PAA is to facilitate the exercise of the right under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. This can be gleaned from the Prime Minister's speech during the second and third reading of the Peaceful Assembly Bill 2011. The Prime Minister had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Under the PAA, the police have ceased its function as a decision-maker. Instead, they have assumed the role as a regulator and facilitator for peaceable assembly. Parliamentary Hansard dated 24 November 2011 can be referred to highlight this comparison with regards to the power granted to the police. The Prime Minister had stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Based on the above, we are of the view that every interest of the citizen must be treated equally. It is settled jurisprudence in public law that rights of one set of citizens cannot override the rights of another. Surely, the exercise of that right must be balanced with each other. That was what the PAA intended to regulate. We are fortified in our view by the decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of <i>Re Ramlila Maidan Incident</i> [2012] INSC 138 where it was held [at p 11 para 32]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Premised on the above discussion, if the purposive test as alluded above is not observed in interpreting the PAA, then plainly the right to assemble peaceably would result in the rights of others to be trampled upon flagrantly. The police would not be able to play their role as facilitators and regulators effectively. Indeed, they may not even be able to prepare adequately to provide protection for those participating in the assemblies. This is a recipe for public disorder. That would run counter to the purpose of the PAA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Is The PAA In Accordance With International Standards?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Now let us examine whether the PAA is consonant with the international standards. We recognise that the freedom of peaceable assembly is an established right under international human rights law. The critical issue to be asked is whether the advance notification is required for an assembly to take place under the law. We begin our discussion by examining the position in the European Union (EU). Article 11 of the <i>European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</i> ("European Convention") protects the right to peaceably assemble, but the right is not absolute. State authorities may impose certain restrictions on the exercise of this right, provided that such limitations are: (a) prescribed by law; (b) necessary in a democratic society; and (c) in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedom of others.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> While art 11 of the European Convention does not require organisers to submit advance notification to state authorities or request authorisation, however, all of the countries surveyed require advance notification, except Sweden.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The question is: how far prior or advance notification is required to be given to the state authorities. Portugal requires a minimum of two days, France and Italy require three days, the United Kingdom requires six days and Malaysia requires 10 days.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In Malaysia, the rationale of the ten-day notice in the PAA was explained by Dato' Seri Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz (the Minister) during the debate of the Peaceful Assembly Bill 2011. International norms were considered in imposing the ten-day notification period. Guidelines from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were studied. In this context, the Minister said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> As can be seen above, the requirement for the ten-day notice in advance is crucial and reasonable to enable the police to make the "necessary plan and preparation" to satisfy their legal obligation under the PAA, particularly to facilitate the lawful exercise of one's right to assemble peaceably as well as to preserve public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other persons. This position is consistent with the position in the European Union.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decided Cases Of The European Court Of Human Right On "Prior Notification"</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We now turn to consider the decided cases on the requirement to give prior or advance notice before the assembly is held. The United Nation Human Rights Committee (UNCHR) in the case of <i>Kivenmaa v. Finland</i> (31 March 1994) Comm No 412/1990 (UN Human Rights Committee) found that a requirement to notify the police of an intended demonstration in a public place six hours before its commencement may be compatible with the permitted limitations laid down in art 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) where the committee acknowledged that a requirement to pre-notify an assembly would normally be for reasons of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. As a general rule, no State can be bound by a treaty without having given its consent to be bound. Malaysia is not a signatory to the ICCPR, but such principles can be used to assist in the interpretation of the relevant Malaysian law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The requirement to give prior or advance notice is also consistent with art 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Commission on Human Rights stated in <i>Rassemblement Jurassien and Unite Jurassienne v. Switzerland</i> [1979] ECHR 7 at para 114:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the case of <i>Bukta and Others v. Hungary</i> [2007] ECHR 610, the police dispersed an assembly which intended to protest a meeting between the Hungarian Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Romania. The assembly was disbanded because the organiser failed to notify the authorities three days in advance as prescribed by their laws. The applicants argued that it was impossible for them to notify the police three days in advance as the announcement regarding the meeting was made by the Prime Minister only the day before.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in declaring that there was a violation of art 11 of the European Convention held that the lack of advance warning of the Hungarian Prime Minister's intention to attend the reception had left the applicants with a choice between forgoing their right to peaceable assembly or disregarding the notice requirement. According to the court, this is a special circumstance where an immediate response such as a spontaneous demonstration to a political event might be justified. Hence, the action on the part of the police to disperse the demonstration was disproportionate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> A different result was reached in the case of <i>Éva Molnár v. Hungary</i>, [2008] ECHR 1027 where the court made clear that the principle established in the case of <i>Bukta and Others (supra)</i> could not be extended to the point that the absence of prior notification could never be a legitimate basis for crowd dispersal. In this case, two months after the official results of the Hungary elections were final, several hundred demonstrators started to protest against the statutory destruction of the ballots without giving any notification to the relevant authorities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The ECHR noted that the right to hold spontaneous demonstrations could override the obligation to give prior notification to public assemblies but only in special circumstances, namely if an immediate response to a current event was warranted in the form of a demonstration. In particular, such derogation from the general rule (of prior notification) could be justified if a delay would have rendered that response obsolete. In that case, there were no such special circumstances and the fact that the police did not break up the demonstration for several hours was a further reason for the finding of no violation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The ECHR in the case of <i>Skiba v. Poland</i> [2009] ECHR Application No 10659/03 faced a similar issue in relation to prior notice for rights of peaceable assembly. The applicant in that case led its members of an association to protest against an exhibition without notifying the authorities three days in advance as required by law. As a result, the applicant was fined approximately €100 for organising a public meeting without first notifying the authorities. The regional court held that the applicant is liable for a fine solely for failing to give the authorities the requisite prior notification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The applicant lodged a complaint with the ECHR alleging a breach of rights in the European Convention on Human Rights by Poland, among others, right to freedom of peaceable assembly under art 11 of the European Convention . According to the court, the legitimate aim of the law to require an organiser to notify the authority was not to arbitrarily restrict the exercise of the right in question but rather to give the authorities a reasonable amount of time to take adequate steps to reconcile the exercise by certain people of their right to freedom of peaceable assembly. It also seeks to protect the legitimate rights and interests of other people, including the freedom of movement and at the same time upholding law and order and prevent crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In <i>Skiba</i>'s case, the court noted at the outset the applicant was punished not for participating in the public meeting but for knowingly disregarding the relevant domestic law under which, as the leader of the scheduled public meeting, he had an obligation to give prior notification to the authorities. In this regard, the court noted that his obligation under the national law was part of the basic conditions to be met by individuals who wish to exercise their right for freedom of peaceable assembly. The court also highlighted that the applicant's criminal conviction is proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We conclude, therefore, the PAA is in accordance with international norms in the imposition of the ten-day notification requirement. The requirement of advance notification is to allow the authorities to facilitate the lawful exercise of one's right to assemble peaceably.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Does <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">Article 10(2) Of The Federal Constitution</LINK> Authorise The Imposition Of A Criminal Sanction For Failure To Give Ten-Day Notice?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> To our mind, nothing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> could be construed as prohibiting the imposition of criminal sanctions for non-compliance with a ten-day notice. There are several examples to illustrate this point. For example, the freedom of speech in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a)</LINK>. It is restricted by, <i>inter alia</i>, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;;">Sedition Act 1948</LINK> and the restrictions imposed by that Act are backed up with criminal sanctions. Yet the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;;">Sedition Act 1948</LINK> has repeatedly and constantly been held by our courts to be constitutional, most recently by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_518;"><i>Pendakwa Raya lwn. Karpal Singh Ram Singh</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 518</LINK>; [2012] 5 CLJ 580 and in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_628;"><i>Mat Shuhaimi Shafiei v. PP</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 628</LINK>; [2014] 5 CLJ 22.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Similarly, the right to form associations under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(c) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. It is restricted by the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_335;;">Societies Act 1966</LINK> which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that any person who is or acts as a member of an unlawful society or attends a meeting of an unlawful society or pays money or give any aid to or for the purposes of unlawful society would commit an offence which attracts imprisonment or fine or both.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Another example would be restrictions to movement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">art 9</LINK>.

      <b>[56]</b> Thus we are unable to agree with the contention of learned counsel for the respondent that the power to impose criminal sanctions must be expressly provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> itself. The correct approach is to look at the legislative competency of the Parliament under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">art 74 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">Article 74 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> clothes Parliament with power to legislate. Internal security, which includes public order, is within the legislative competence of Parliament under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">List I, Item 3 of the Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. Read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;40.;;">s 40(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>, it is plain that Parliament may criminalise any act. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;40.;;">Section 40(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> is as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> It was argued by learned counsel for the respondent that "criminalisation" of the restrictions that limit the right guaranteed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b)</LINK> was not 'reasonable' and therefore unconstitutional. Learned counsel for the respondent relied on the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_6_375;"><i>Sivarasa Rasiah v. Badan Peguam Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 6 MLRA 375</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 333; [2010] 3 CLJ 507 in support of his argument. In <i>Sivarasa (supra)</i>, the Federal Court had this to say at p 379 para [5]:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_396;">Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim v. Menteri Dalam Negeri Malaysia [2006] 2 MLRA 396</LINK>; [2006] 6 MLJ 213; [2007] 1 CLJ 19, the Court of Appeal held [at p 398 para [9]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In our view, the reliance on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1975_1_75;"><i>Ooi Ah Phua v. Officer-In-Charge Criminal Investigation, Kedah/Perlis</i> [1975] 1 MLRA 75</LINK>; [1975] 2 MLJ 198 by the court in the <i>Dr Mohd Nasir (supra)</i> to justify the reading into 'restrictions' the word 'reasonable' was misplaced. In fact, the adoption of the reasoning by the Federal Court in <i>Ooi Ah Phua (supra)</i> was actually being asked to read into <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5</LINK> the word 'immediately' in the clause "... shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice." This, the Federal Court refused to do so. Similarly, in this instant appeal, we are not persuaded the word "reasonable" should be read into <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> With respect, in our view, the manner in which the Federal Court in <i>Sivarasa</i> went about on how to construe 'restrictions' was completely at variance with an earlier decision of the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_507;"><i>PP v. Pung Chen Choon</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 507</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 566; [1994] 1 AMR 689 where it was held as follows [at p 511]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Thus, as the law currently stand, there are two conflicting decisions of the apex courts. The question is: which approach ought to be followed by this court in this instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> To answer that question, it is necessary to consider three propositions which are supported with authorities:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The authority for the first proposition above is the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1975_1_646;"><i>Loh Kooi Choon v. Government Of Malaysia</i> [1975] 1 MLRA 646</LINK>; [1977] 2 MLJ 187 [at p 646], where it was held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> There is no reason for us to depart from the pronouncement in <i>Loh Kooi Choon</i> above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> For the second proposition above, it is trite law that words are not read into any provision of a statute unless without that words, the provision of the statute would be completely meaningless (<i>Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim Ltd v. Evans</i> [1910] AC 444 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_712;"><i>Thein Hong Teck &amp; Ors v. Mohd Afrizan Husain &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 712</LINK>; [2012] 2 MLJ 299; [2012] 1 CLJ 49; [2012] 1 AMR 489). Aligned to this proposition is the maxim "Parliament does not legislate in vain". It is for that reason that the court would not allow a provision of statute to be completely meaningless and therefore read words into it, if need be, to give life to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> However, the same cannot be said to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. The provision of the Article is very clear. Therefore, there is no necessity to read the word "reasonable" into that Article. If the court is going to do so, it will have the effect of the court usurping the law-making powers of the Parliament.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Legislative History Of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">Article 10</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Concerning the third proposition, it is common ground that the Constitution of the Federation of Malaya was drafted by the Reid Commission, a body of eminent jurists from the Commonwealth of Nations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> In the early draft of the Constitution prepared by the Reid Commission, freedom of, <i>inter alia</i>, assembly was found initially as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8(2)</LINK>. The draft <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">Article 8(2)</LINK> is similarly worded as the present <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(b)</LINK> with one major exception. The draft art 8(2) dated 19 October 1956 read as follows: [at pp 216-217]</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> So, the framers of our Constitution did include the word "reasonable" to qualify "restriction" initially in the early draft of the Constitution, presumably following the Indian model. The question now, therefore, why the word 'reasonable' disappeared in the final draft accepted as our <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> The answer to that poser can be found in a Note of Dissent written by one member of the Reid Commission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan, a member of the Commission, and subsequent to that early draft mentioned above, wrote a Note of Dissent dated 11 February 1957 that was included in the final report of the Reid Commission at p 101. His note deals with matters over which there is disagreement, among others, the draft version of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10</LINK> (the former draft art 8). Justice Abdul Hamid objected to the inclusion of the word "reasonable", on the following grounds [at p 101]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> The Working Committee adopted Justice Abdul Hamid's dissent and adopted his recommendation by removing the word 'reasonable' from the provisions of the proposed draft. This, in other words, eliminated the possibility of judicial review concerning the reasonableness of laws which infringed the rights granted by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> This position of law was restated in the Constitutional Proposals for the Federation of Malaya ("White Paper") in June 1957. Clause 10(1)(b) of the Proposed Constitution of Federation of Malaya reads [at p 36]:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> It, therefore, follows that the non-inclusion of the word "reasonable" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10</LINK> was not some oversight on the part of the Reid Commission; it was a deliberate decision anchored on an objection by one framer based on reasons given. The framers of our Constitution did not want the word "reasonable" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10</LINK> because:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> In short, the framers of our Constitution wanted the Parliament to be the judge of what was "reasonable" and not the courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> The deliberate omission of the word "reasonable" from the final draft that formed our Constitution is akin to the Parliament itself amending the Constitution. And once so amended, it is explicit that the preamendment position cannot be used to determine the validity of a provision of a statute. As was stated by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_2_351;"><i>PP v. Kok Wah Kuan</i> [2007] 2 MLRA 351</LINK> [at p 356]; [2008] 1 MLJ 1; [2007] 6 CLJ 341:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> We are mindful that the words used or not used by the framers of our Constitution are not etched in stone. The Constitution may be amended to include or remove or modify any word or words originally used or excluded by the framers. But surely that is a task for Parliament. To allow the court to reinstate that word "reasonable" would tantamount to the courts amending the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> against the decision of the framers of our Constitution, in fact usurping the powers of the Parliament.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> In the circumstances, it is clear that the decision of <i>Sivarasa</i> is merely obiter. We also noted that the case of <i>Pung Chen Choon</i> was not even referred to, nor cited in <i>Sivarasa</i>. All the more the dicta in <i>Sivarasa</i> ought not be followed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> Therefore, the correct constitutional position with respect to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10</LINK> was as stated by the Supreme Court in <i>Pung Chen Choon</i>. Although <i>Pung Chen Choon</i> did not refer to the legislative history of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10</LINK>, the conclusion it reached on the term 'reasonable' was consistent with the legislative history.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> To recap, the whole purpose of the PAA was to enable the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. To that end, the PAA contains procedural provisions that are regulatory in nature. The noncompliance with those procedures does not stop a citizen from exercising his right to assemble peaceably and without arms. In other words, there is really no restriction on the right to assemble peaceably and without arms in the framework of the PAA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The factual matrix of the instant appeal prove that the right to assemble peaceably and without arms is not dependent on giving notice. Hence, the requirement to give notice is not a restriction of a right to assemble <i>per se</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In this instant appeal, the respondent was not charged for being a participant in the peaceable assembly. Rather he was charged for the failure to obey a federal law, namely, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> that required him to give prior notice. Indeed, in no way was his right to assemble peaceably and without arms thereby affected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> In the premises, we will answer the questions posed earlier (at pp 9 and 10 of this judgment) in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> We are of the firm opinion that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">s 9(5) of the PAA</LINK> does not run foul of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(b) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2012_736;9.;;">Section 9(5)</LINK> is entirely constitutional, valid and enforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> We, therefore with respect, have to depart from the earlier decision and the view taken by this court in <i>Nik Nazmi</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> Based on the material before us, we are more than satisfied that there are sufficient evidence to support the conviction of the respondent as recorded by the Sessions Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> Accordingly, we allowed the Public Prosecutor's appeal on conviction and sentence. We affirm the conviction and sentence imposed by the Sessions Court.</p>
