    <p>The High Court had dismissed the appellants'/plaintiffs' claims in their consolidated suits (Suit No: 22-40-2006(MR) - "first suit" and Suit No: 22- 46-2007(MR) - "second suit") on the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to discharge the burden of proof that they had acquired Native Customary Rights ("NCR") over the disputed lands. The plaintiffs thus appealed to the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs' complaint was that the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant had subjected land over which they enjoyed native customary rights to the grant of a quarry licence to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had engaged the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to operate and manage the quarry on the land. The defendants disputed the plaintiffs' rights and contended <i>inter alia</i>, that the plaintiffs' claims were timebarred since they were instituted more than six years after the grant of the quarry licence on 1 December 1988.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> NCR claim to land requires careful consideration. On the one hand, it is always possible that the claim is false, made by individuals seeking to extort money from a company that is investing in the development of land granted to it by the State. In such case, the State must be protected. On the other hand, it is equally possible that the claim is <i>bona fide</i>. If the claim is <i>bona fide</i>, the grant by the State of the land to another is taking away property belonging to the holder of the right without compensation. The consideration by the court must necessarily be focused as to the merits of the claim, and it must do so according to law and purely on the facts, which if disputed, is proved at least upon a balance of probabilities. (para 7)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> NCR, as a property right, is guaranteed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution ("FC")</LINK>. The plaintiffs could not be deprived of such right except through law. No law shall provide for the compulsory acquisition or use of property without adequate compensation. Since there was no averment that compensation had been paid, there would have been, if the plaintiffs held NCR over the land, a contravention of the plaintiffs' constitutional right when the quarry licence was issued to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> NCR to land acquired prior to 1 January 1958 is a property right protected by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the FC</LINK>, and in the instant case since the quarry licence had the effect of taking away that right during the term of the licence, the issue of the quarry licence was unconstitutional, null and void against the plaintiffs. The quarry licence issued after the acquisition of NCR was a nullity. It was automatically void and a nullity, and it would defeat any logic to say that the limitation provision could allow the licence to be maintained. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the quarry licence issued on 1 December 1988 by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant had expired but was renewed in 2003. The renewal refreshed the cause of action accruing from the renewal, ie in 2003 and not the first date of issue on 1 December 1988. The filing of the civil suit in 2006 was therefore not time barred if the plaintiffs succeeded to prove that they had NCR. The High Court had erred in accepting the submission for the defendants, including in holding that the plaintiffs' claim filed in 2006 was not brought within six years of the issuance of the quarry licence on 1 December 1988. (paras 31-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The plaintiffs' evidence in support of the claim to having acquired NCR, however short of being perfect, remained more than the evidence adduced for the defendants. The plaintiffs had therefore successfully proved their case upon the balance of probabilities. Even though their "map" P3 fell short of being an officially recognised survey map, they were entitled to a ruling that they had successfully proved upon the balance of probabilities their NCR to the lands that they occupied.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Two Civil Suits No: 22-40-2006(MR) and No: 22-46-2007(MR) were consolidated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The High Court dismissed the appellants/plaintiffs' Tamit Anak Anjat and others ("the plaintiffs") claims in their consolidated civil suits on the that the plaintiffs had failed to discharge the burden of proof that they had acquired Native Customary Rights (NCR) over the disputed lands.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiffs appealed to this court. Their grounds of appeal were that the High Court had erred:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court Grounds</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The decision of the High Court was summed up in the first paragraph of the grounds of decision. The four-page grounds of judgment gave its reasons beginning from the second paragraph thereof as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>General Observations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We find a decision by acceptance of the submissions by one party or another, and this case submissions by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant reproduced under subparagraphs (1)-(7) of the second paragraph to be a matter of concern. A judgment is ultimately a demonstration of the processes of reasoning and application of law on facts that are disclosed, checked and verified to be true and correct and therefore safe to rely upon as basis for a decision. A decision is made upon (a) facts not disputed, (b) the evidence as to disputed facts to arrive at findings of fact, and (c) of the reasoning upon undisputed facts and the findings of fact to arrive at a conclusion and decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In the days when submissions for the litigants were focused upon the ends of justice, it may suffice but even so only if the grounds of judgment explained why the submissions of one party was accepted instead of the other. An acceptance of one party's submission, without an explanation as to why that submission was accepted and why the opposing submission was not, is no demonstration of judicial appreciation and consideration. In the present day focus of adversarial submissions purely in favour of one's client, great caution need be exercised lest acceptance makes it appears the court is taking sides with one party or another.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> With respect, NCR claim to land requires careful consideration. On the one hand, it is always possible that the claim is false, made by individuals essentially seeking to extort money from a company that is investing in the development of land granted to it by the State. In such case, the State, in this case the State of Sarawak, must be protected. On the other hand, it is equally possible that the claim is <i>bona fide</i>. If the claim is <i>bona fide</i>, the grant by the State of the land to another is taking away property belonging to the holder of the right without compensation. The consideration by the court must necessarily be focussed as to the merits of the claim, and it must do so according to law and purely on the facts, which if disputed, is proved at least upon a balance of probabilities. The following sets out that approach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The civil litigation in this case, begun at the High Court appealed from, and now on appeal before this court, was at all times about whether the plaintiffs' NCR claim to the land is <i>bona fide</i> or not. No human, and that must include the court, is capable of divining the truth as to whether the claim is <i>bona fide</i> or not. Nevertheless, the decision making in the court in the adversarial system of civil litigation is structured upon the foundation that a fair and just decision is obtained by the application of the law upon facts that are safe to rely upon as true and correctly stated. That a dispute is brought before the court simply means that either the officers of the state erred or the claim is even perhaps fraudulent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In a court of law, the determination begins with considering and appreciating what are the facts relied upon; and</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the civil litigation, the process of determining the facts is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We examined the Record of Appeal and the submissions made before the High Court as well as before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Suit No: 22-40-2006(MR)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In Suit No: 22-40-2006(MR), it was pleaded that the said NCR Land was first occupied in 1943 under the leadership of one Tuai Rumah Jilom Anak Benang. Particulars were given that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In its defence, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant put the plaintiffs to strict proof of their claim to NCR and maintained that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was engaged by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to operate and manage a stone quarry at an area which is not situated within and/or part of any of the plaintiffs' alleged NCR land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The defence by the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent/defendant was to deny each and every assertion by the plaintiffs and maintained that it was issued with licenses to "Quarry And Remove Stone" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;32A.;;">s 32A of the Land Code (Sarawak) (Cap 81) ('Land Code')</LINK> by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The defence by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants were that they:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Suit No: 22-46-2007(MR)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In Suit No: 22-46-2007(MR), it was pleaded that the said NCR Land was first occupied in 1943 under the leadership of one Tuai Rumah Jilom Anak Benang. Particulars were given that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Paragraphs 4.4 to 4.7 of Suit No: 22-46-2007(MR) repeated paras 5.4 - 5.7 of Suit No: 22-40-2006(MR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant denied the allegations contained in paras 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and paras 11 to 25 of the statement of claim including the particulars thereto, or that the plaintiffs had any NCR over the land situated at/or along Sungai Lembong and Sungai Sebubok, Suai, Miri Sarawak and or described in para 4 of the statement of claim and in the map annexed to the Statement of Claim or at all and put the plaintiffs to strict proof thereof. It maintained that the said lands were also situated within the Niah Forest Reserve which was gazetted as a forest reserve under Gazette Notification No 1707 on 29 November 1957 and there were no rights, including NCR, admitted within the said Forest Reserve. It counterclaimed, <i>inter alia</i>, for declarations, injunction and general and special damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Native Customary Rights</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> There is no doubt that if the appellants held NCR to the land upon which the quarry is located, they would suffer loss. This we address further below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Further the NCR, as a property right, is guaranteed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> that the plaintiffs not be deprived of it save in accordance with law and that no law shall provide for the compulsory acquisition or use of property without adequate compensation. Since there was no averment that compensation had been paid, there would have been, if the plaintiffs held NCR over the land, a contravention of the plaintiffs' constitutional right when the quarry license was issued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> NCR to land was recognised by the First Rajah of Sarawak since 1842. In <i>Nor Anak Nyawai &amp; Ors v. Borneo Pulp Plantation Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors (supra)</i>, Ian Chin J had stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The development of common law with regard to native custom may be traced also in the development of the law on NCR to land in other Commonwealth jurisdictions. A relatively recent case, <i>Takamore v. Clarke</i> [2011] NZCA 587 illustrated the historical developments. In New Zealand, Chief Justice William Martin and Justice Henry Chapman in <i>R v. Symonds</i> [1847] NZPCC 387 held that native title subsisted notwithstanding the assumption of sovereignty by the Crown, and that the Crown was bound to respect it. The view continued to be held in In re The Lyndon and Whitaker Claims Act 1871 [1872] 2 NZCA 41. The notion of native title being extinguished or reduced to a licence gained ground in the controversial decision in <i>Wi Parata v. The Bishop of Wellington</i> [1877] 3 NZ Jur (NS) SC 72, when Chief Justice James Prendergast transformed the position of aboriginal title from one subsisting at law, to one held on sufferance of the Crown. In <i>Wi Parata</i>, the land concerned belonged originally to the Ngati Toa tribe. The land was provided to the church in 1848 for the purpose of building of a school. No school was built. But in 1850 a Crown grant to the Bishop was issued without the consent of the tribe. It was argued that the Crown was the legal donor of the land, not the tribe, and therefore if it were to revert, it would be to the Crown.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It was not until mid-1980s that the <i>Wi Parata v. The Bishop of Wellington (supra)</i> was challenged directly in <i>New Zealand Maori Council v. Attorney-General</i> [1987] 1 NZLR 641, commonly known as the Lands Case. The Lands Case and <i>Mabo v. Queensland (No 2)</i> [1992] 66 ALR 408 established that the common law recognises native customary rights.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the book <i>"The Private Letters of Sir James Brooke, KCB, Rajah of Sarawak"</i>, the Editor John C Templer Esq, at vol 1 chapter 1, commencing at p 2, reproduced the writing of Sir James Brooke in 1838 that set out explicitly his intention that the acquisition of sovereignty would not have the effect of extinguishing existing native rights or native title to land. It accorded with the decisions of <i>R v. Symonds (1847) (supra)</i> and <i>In re The Lundon and Whitaker Claims Act 1871 (supra)</i>. At pp 11-12 he wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The Rajah clearly recognised the proprietary rights of the natives, and not mere licence to occupy at sufferance of the new sovereign taking over. This is the key to appreciation of the development of the law in relation to native customary rights. The Land Order 1875 did not deny the recognition of the native customary right to land. Legislation in Sarawak progressively sought to limit new acquisition of land by native customary rights. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">Section 5(2)(i) of the Land Code</LINK>, effective 1 January 1958 (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">s 5(1)</LINK>) finally reduced the status of native customary title rights to land created under it to the status of a license. Even so, the Land Code recognised the subsistence of NCR to land acquired before it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">Section 5 of the Land Code</LINK> provided that:</p>

      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">Section 5</LINK> became law from 1 January 1958. With reference to customary rights created under that section, the proviso means only that until a title has been issued for the customary rights thus created under it, the land remains State Land. Proviso (ii) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">s 5</LINK> acknowledged that the question whether any such right has been created or has been lost or terminated shall be determined by the law in force immediately prior to 1 January 1958. It means that NCR which before 1 January 1958 could be acquired even before issue of a title were preserved. That the provision that the acquirer of the native customary right does not have to pay rent until a document of title is issued in effect encouraged natives not to apply for the document of title.</p>

      <b>[29]</b> The recognition of NCR to land has been well established in Malaysia: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1997_3_95;"><i>Adong Kuwau &amp; Ors v.

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We, therefore, held that NCR to land acquired prior to 1 January 1958 is a property right protected by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>, and that the quarry licence having the effect of taking away that right during the term of the licence, the issue of the quarry licence was unconstitutional, null and void against the plaintiffs. The quarry licence issued after the acquisition of NCR was a nullity. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909, it was held that an order that is a nullity can be disregarded and impeached in any proceeding. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_507;"><i>Eu Finance Berhad v. Lim Yoke Foo</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 507</LINK>; [1982] 2 MLJ 37 it was held, adopting the reasoning of Lord Denning in Director of <i>Public Prosecutions v. Head</i> [1959] AC 83, that where an order is a void order, it would be a nullity and there would be no need for an order to quash it as it would be automatically null and void without more ado. Similarly, the quarry licence being issued contrary to the constitution on land on which NCR subsisted, it was automatically void and a nullity, and it would defeat any logic to say that limitation provision can allow the licence to be maintained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We further observe alternatively that a license is a right for the duration of the licence. Therefore, a quarry licence is a right to the stones for the duration of the licence. That licence issued 1 December 1988 had long expired. It was pleaded by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that the quarry licence issued by the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant expired but was renewed in 2003. In our view, the renewal refreshes the cause of action accruing from the renewal, ie in 2003 and not the first date of issue on 1 December 1988, and the filing of the civil suit in 2006 was therefore not time barred if the plaintiffs succeed to prove that they had NCR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> For all of the above reasons, we held that the High Court erred in accepting the submission for the defendants, including in holding that the plaintiffs' claim "filed in 2006 was not brought within six years of the issuance of the quarry licence on 1 December 1988."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We then addressed pivotal question of the proof of the existence of the plaintiffs' NCR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Existence Of NCR</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The key pleading in both cases was that the NCR Land was first occupied in 1943 (see paras 5.4 and 4.4 of respective statements of claims). The 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants in Suit No: 22-40-2006(MR) at para 3, para 3, and para 3 respectively, denied it and put the plaintiffs to strict proof. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants in Suit No: 22-46-2007(MR) at para 1 and para 3(b) did likewise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In Suit No: 22-40-2006(MR), Meringai Anak Segeran (WN KP 490804- 13-5571) (PW1) testified in QA14, QA16 that his ancestors came onto the land in 1943. The cross-examination for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not challenge this.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> To a question for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that "Earlier you mentioned some cultivation of fruit trees, rubber and cocoa in the quarry area. When did the cultivation first started at the quarry area?", PW1 replied "I only recall family by the name Jilum who started cultivation activities at the quarry area. I do not remember when." It was counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant who asked "Is it in 1943", to which PW1 replied "Yes". That answer was not challenged. To counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, he candidly agreed that his testimony was based on what he was told by someone else. Although the witness was born in August 1948, the counsel had no hesitation to put to him that in fact in 1951 the area within the quarry licence was still virgin jungle and to accept his "yes" answer, but refuses to accept the "I disagree" to his next question that "Am I correct to say that the historical events you mentioned in your Witness Statement were told to you by someone else?" The cross-examination did little to assist the case for the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The defences put forward in the submissions and accepted by the court were along the lines that there was no evidence of land clearance and/or cultivation, that the plaintiffs could have produced photographs to show the fruit trees and/or padi planted, the map produced was not correct and could not be relied upon as PW4 was not qualified to prepare a map as he was not a qualified surveyor, that DW3 was not an independent witness and from the photographs at Appendix A exh DWS8 there was no sign of land clearance and the plaintiffs had disobeyed the court order of 8 May 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> With respect disobedience of the court order of 8 May 2007 is not the subject of the litigation and the instant appeal, and the other defences are attempts to show shortcomings in the proof adduced before the court. Our consideration may be summed up as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The issue in the case is not whether the map P3 is accurate, but whether the defendants encroached upon land occupied by the plaintiffs under NCR. In proof of that claim, the map was mere illustration in the narrative of the plaintiffs' claim. Without reproducing all their testimonies, it remains clear the witnesses from the plaintiffs had testified and were tested by cross-examination as the defendants desired. They stood firm on their testimony. Even where cross-examination shows their testimony was not conclusive or bulletproof, it was not wholly destroyed. They did not recant on their testimony. The result of the cross-examination enables a trial court to have a better appreciation of the real value or weight of their testimony, whether they were witnesses worthy of at least some credibility or none at all. There being no single fact the absence of proof of which is fatal to the plaintiffs case, the sum total of the testimony and other evidence are what are placed on the symbolic balancing scale of justice to determine if the plaintiffs had successfully proved their case upon the balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The defendants' submissions denying the plaintiffs' claim and asserting inadequacies of the plaintiffs' evidence aside, the evidence of substance for the defendants were the exhs D35, D62 and D63, aerial photographs taken in 1950 showing cleared area of approximately 430 hectares and 407 hectares, and in 1963 showing cleared areas of approximately 1,147 hectares.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The evidence was that the first occupation was in 1943 and the area occupied were gradually increased. It must be appreciated that the 1963 photograph did not show that the additional area was acquired in 1963 itself, but between 1950 and 1963. This is material as the restriction under the Land Code applied from 1 January 1958. The three aerial photographs therefore did not serve to contradict the evidence for the plaintiffs. The submissions "Lot 176 Suai Land District and Lot 96 Suai Land District as shown in exh D63 and there are in the pemakai menoa of the appellants." is not inconsistent with the evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The above underlines that although the resolution of the matter lies in the parties, and more importantly the land officers going to the ground to see (a) where the boundaries of the plaintiffs' NCR Land were, and (b) where the boundaries for the respective 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's lands were, so that the facts as to the location and boundaries can be determined, the defendants did not do so but were content to defend as they have done in trial and upon appeal in this court on scant evidence and denials.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As the foregoing inevitably points, the plaintiffs' evidence in support of the claim to having acquired NCR, however short of being perfect evidence, remains more than the evidence adduced for the defendants. The plaintiffs have, therefore, successfully proved their case upon the balance of probabilities. Even though their "map" P3 falls short of being an officially recognised survey map, they are entitled to a ruling that they have successfully proved upon the balance of probabilities their NCR to the lands that they occupy, including under pemakai menoa, subject to survey of the boundaries if one were eventually made, approximately delineated by the map P3.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Accordingly, we allowed the appeal, entered judgment in terms of prayers (i) - (ix) and (xiv) - (xvi) of the plaintiffs' statement of claim, and ordered in respect of each appeal, costs in the sum of RM15,000.00, RM10,000.00 against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, and RM10,000 against the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants.</p>
