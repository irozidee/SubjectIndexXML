    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent was a medical doctor who owned a private maternity home and clinic ('the said premises'). Since 2004, the respondent had submitted multiple applications for renewal of licence for a private hospital in the said premises. Following inspections conducted by officers from Jabatan Kesihatan Negeri Selangor ('JKNS') on the said premises, the respondent's applications were refused due to non-compliance with the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1973_384;;">Private Hospitals Regulations 1973</LINK> and medical practice. JKNS had on many occasions notified the respondent that it was an offence to operate a private hospital without licence under the then <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Private Hospitals Act 1971 ('Act 43')</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 1998 ('Act 586')</LINK> which came into force in 2006. JKNS also advised the respondent to provide outpatient services only. In 2008, acting upon instructions following a report of an incident of death, a team of enforcement officers/inspectors from the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's office conducted an inspection on the said premises. During the inspection, the said premises was found to be in operation as a private maternity home without a licence as required under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK>. The inspectors then sealed the said premises and issued to the respondent a Notice of Offence and Seal of Premises ('the Seal Notice'). The respondent sought declaratory reliefs at the High Court to challenge the appellants' conduct in issuing the Seal Notice and consequently sealing off the said premises. The High Court found that the appellants had failed to take into account the fact that the respondent had applied for a licence since 2004 and the appellants whose conduct had repeatedly varied the conditions for approval from time to time had resulted in the non-processing and non-issuance of licence for the said premises. The respondent had also successfully refuted the incidence of death said to have happened at the said premises. The High Court allowed the application for declaratory orders by the respondent and the order for the removal of the seal to the said premises, and allowed the respondent to continue to operate his healthcare facilities and services on the said premises. The appellants hence appealed against the High Court's decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appellants' appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The licence for the said premises under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK> expired in 2004. The respondent did try to renew the licence; however the appellants for various reasons rejected it. When <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK> came into effect in 2006, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK> was repealed. Therefore, since the said premises' licence to operate expired in 2004 and the respondent had failed to get it renewed in accordance with <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK>, the status of the said premises remained as an unlicensed private hospital under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK> as well as under the new <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK>. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The inspection made on the said premises was prompted by a report of a death of a mother during delivery incident, which had allegedly occurred in the said premises. However, whether or not such incident did occur at the said premises was not material to the finding that the respondent did not have a licence to operate the said premises as a maternity home. It would not invalidate any findings made as a result of such inspection. The appellants had 'reasonable cause' to believe that the said premises was in operation without a licence seeing that during the inspection, the respondent had failed to tender evidence that the said premises had been licensed. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Seen from the respondent's viewpoint, JKNS had unreasonably withheld its approval since it would seem that JKNS kept changing its terms and conditions. What the respondent failed to address was the fact that he had applied for the renewal of the license since 2004, and each time it was rejected by reason that he had failed to comply with some requirements of the law and JKNS. Upon being rejected, the respondent did not take quick remedial action to resubmit his application for the relevant year, but instead he reapplied for renewal in the following year thus rendering his application as a fresh application for approval of the JKNS. In so doing, the respondent could not have a legitimate expectation for obtaining the licence upon compliance with the conditions imposed. If the respondent submitted a fresh application each year for renewal of licence, it was not surprising that JKNS treated it as a fresh application each time it was submitted and considered it on its merits. There was nothing inappropriate about this process seeing that a licence which was subject to renewal, might also include such matters as agreements entered into, for instance, for blood supply, clinical waste management, fire certificate, etc. These were also subject to renewal. Certainly there could be no estoppel where the application was a new application, and the requirements imposed were not shown to be contrary to or to exceed the responsibility of the respondent.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Umi Kalthum Abdul Majid JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appeal is against the decision by the learned judge of the High Court dated 28 February 2013 in allowing the respondent's application for declaratory order that the closure of Klinik Salina and Rumah Bersalin owned by the respondent was against the law, that is, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;;">Medical Act 1971</LINK> and <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 1998</LINK>, that the closure of the same be declared unlawful and Klinik Salina and Rumah Bersalin be allowed to continue to operate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts could be summarised as follows. The respondent is a medical doctor. In 1990 the respondent met one Dr Samsudin who owned a private maternity home and clinic called "Klinik Salina dan Rumah Bersalin" at No 28, Jalan Tengku Diauddin, 41000 Klang ("the said premises"). Dr Samsudin intended to sell his practice at the clinic which has been in operation for about 20 years. The respondent then bought the practice from Dr Samsudin. The respondent carried on with the said practice. The respondent had two midwives, two nurses, a full time doctor and ten workers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In 2004, the respondent submitted an application for renewal of licence for a private hospital in the said premises. An inspection was conducted by officers from Jabatan Kesihatan Negeri Selangor ("JKNS") at the said premises. However, vide a letter dated 17 August 2004, JKNS rejected the respondent's application stating that the JKNS refused to process the application because there were certain features in the said premises and its administration which did not comply with the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1973_384;;">Private Hospitals Regulations 1973</LINK> ("Regulation 1973") and medical practice. JKNS cited a few examples of non-compliance such as there was no scrub room and changing room outside the operation theatre, no proper movement of soiled equipment and instruments from the operation theatre to the "dirty room" and no sterilisation area for the operation theatre. The respondent was to notify JKNS for further inspection on the said premises after the respondent had done the necessary rectifications. Since there was no response from the respondent, on the 19 May 2005, JKNS notified the respondent that it was an offence to operate a private hospital without licence and advised the respondent to provide outpatient services only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 14 October 2005, the respondent submitted a new application for renewal and claimed that the respondent had satisfied all the requirements that were imposed by the appellants. JKNS vide letter dated 20 October 2005 indicated that JKNS refused to process the application because the application was incomplete. The respondent failed to submit a copy of the Annual Practising Certificate of the midwife, fire certificate, national registration number of nurses, agreement for ambulance service, agreement for supply of blood, agreement for clinical waste management services. JKNS returned the application form to the respondent and requested the respondent to resubmit a completed application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 22 November 2005, the respondent resubmitted the application for renewal together with a letter of confirmation that the services for ambulance, blood supply, clinical waste management, pest control and laundry services were being provided to the said premises. The application was returned to the respondent on 20 December 2005, because the respondent failed to provide the agreements on the engagement of the various services required by the JKNS including the licence or certificate of fitness for the autoclave machine from the Department of Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 7 March 2006, JKNS issued a warning to the respondent stating that the said premises was without a licence, which is an offence under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Private Hospitals Act 1971 ("Act 43")</LINK> and the forthcoming <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 1998 ("Act 586")</LINK>. JKNS reminded the respondent to submit application for licence and advised the respondent to provide outpatient service only. On 1 May 2006, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK> came into operation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 8 February 2007, the respondent resubmitted the application to JKNS for renewal of licence to provide private healthcare facility and service. Once again JKNS refused to process the application on the ground that the application was incomplete for lack of certificate of fitness for autoclave machine. Moreover, since the maternity home had no licence to operate since 31 July 2004, JKNS advised the respondent to apply for licence as a new maternity home by applying for approval to establish or maintain a new private healthcare facility and service in Form 1, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2006_138;;">Private Healthcare Facilities And Services (Private Hospital and other Private Healthcare Facilities) Regulations 2006 ("Regulations 2006")</LINK>. On 23 March 2007, the Ministry of Health issued a reminder that the maternity home should not be in operation because it has no licence under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 5 June 2008, acting upon instructions of the Mesyuarat Jawatankuasa Kematian Ibu Peringkat Negeri Selangor, a team of enforcement officers/ inspectors from the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's office conducted an inspection on the said premises. During the inspection, it was found that the said premises was operating as a private maternity home without a licence as required under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK> and <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2006_138;;">Regulations 2006</LINK>. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;91.;;">s 91 of Act 586</LINK>, the Inspectors then sealed the said premises and issued to the respondent a Notice of Offence and Seal of Premises ("Seal Notice"). In the same Seal Notice, a period of 21 days was given to the respondent to produce the necessary licence if the respondent wants to remove the Seal Notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The respondent filed another application to get the approval within 21 days as notified by the appellants however it was rejected by the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The respondent filed the Originating Motion praying for the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 28 February 2013, the learned High Court Judge allowed the respondent's application. Her Ladyship in her brief grounds of judgment stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In the opinion of the learned High Court Judge, the appellants had failed to take into account the fact that the respondent had applied for licence since 2004 but for the conduct of the appellants who had repeatedly varied the conditions for approval from time to time. This had resulted in the non-processing and non-issuance of licence for the said premises. The respondent had also successfully refuted the incidence of death involving a women allegedly said to have happened at the said premises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In so deciding, the learned judge had allowed the said premises to continue to be in operation without a licence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> At the outset, there was a preliminary issue raised by the appellants, that is, whether the respondent had correctly used the appropriate mode in initiating the action at the High Court. At the High Court, the respondent filed an originating motion seeking for declaratory reliefs to challenge the appellant's conduct in issuing the "Notis Kesalahan dan Mengelak Premis" dated 5 June 2008 and consequently sealing off the said premises. Before us, learned Senior Federal Counsel for the appellants submitted that for this purpose the respondent should have filed an application for judicial review instead of an originating motion. Since this issue was not taken up before the learned High Court Judge we declined to deal with this issue on the validity of the mode taken by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Moving on to the appeal before us, learned Senior Federal Counsel for the appellants raised the issue of whether the learned High Court Judge had exercised her discretion judiciously based on the facts and circumstances of the case in allowing the application for declaratory orders by the respondent and the order for the removal of the seal to the said premises and allowing the respondent to continue to operate his healthcare facilities and services on the said premises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Having heard the parties, on the facts, we found that the licence for the said premises under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK> expired on 31 July 2004. The respondent did try to renew the licence, however it was rejected by the appellants for various reasons. When <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK> came into effect on 1 May 2006, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK> was repealed. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;120.;;">Section 120(1) of Act 586</LINK> states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Therefore, since the said premise's licence to operate expired in 2004 and the respondent had failed to get it renewed in accordance with <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK>, the status of the said premises remain as unlicensed private hospital under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK> as well as under the new <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Learned Senior Federal Counsel for the appellants submitted that the respondent had repeatedly failed to furnish the appellants a complete application form for renewal of licence and the respondent had also failed to comply with the prescribed conditions under the law. The conditions required to be fulfilled by the respondent for the purpose of renewal of licence are all provided for in the Regulations. Therefore without a valid licence, the said premises should not be allowed to continue to operate. The repeated reminders and advice by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant (in the form of the JKNS) since the year 2005 for the said premises to stop operation and to provide only outpatient treatment were consistently ignored by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> With the coming into force of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK>, the said premises needs to be licensed under the said Act. On licence, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;3.;;">s 3 of Act 586</LINK> states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Therefore in the instant case, the fact was clear that the respondent had no licence to operate the said premises. The question now was whether the appellant was empowered to issue the "Notis Kesalahan dan Mengelak Premis" dated 5 June 2008 and consequently sealed off the said premises. Learned Senior Federal Counsel for the appellants submitted that the inspection made on the said premises was prompted by a report of a death of a mother during delivery incident which had allegedly occurred in the said premises. However, whether or not such incident did occur at the said premises was not material to the finding that the respondent did not have a licence to operate the said premises as a maternity home. It would not invalidate any findings made as a result of such inspection. The appellants had "reasonable cause" to believe that the said premises was operating without a licence seeing that during the inspection, the respondent had failed to tender evidence that the said premises had been licensed. The statutory power to seal the said premises is provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;91.;;">s 91(1) of Act 586</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In any case, the respondent, in his affidavit-in-reply to the appellants' affidavit-in-reply at paras 7(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Further in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_271;"><i>Empayar Canggih Sdn Bhd v. Ketua Pengarah Bahagian Penguatkuasa Kementerian Perdagangan Dalam Negeri Dan Hal Ehwal Pengguna Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2013] 6 MLRA 271</LINK> at p 277; [2013] 7 CLJ 681, the Court of Appeal, per Zaharah Ibrahim JCA, held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent in reply submitted that as at 2007, the respondent had fulfilled all the conditions and submitted his application. However the appellants rejected and imposed further conditions. Those new requirements imposed by the appellants in the following years could have surely been informed in previous years instead of receiving an application form for a particular year and imposing new requirements for that year and repeatedly imposing new requirements as and when the respondent forwarded an application for renewal of license. The respondent also submitted that the respondent has a legitimate expectation that the licence would be granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It would seem to us that the respondent's arguments were that the JKNS should have considered his various applications for renewal of licence since 2004 as a cumulative application and compliance of the terms and conditions imposed by JKNS throughout the years. Seen from the respondent's view point, the JKNS had unreasonably withheld its approval since it would seem that the JKNS kept on changing its terms and conditions. What the respondent failed to address was the fact that he had applied for the renewal of the license since 2004, and each time it was rejected by reason that he had failed to comply with some requirements of the law and the JKNS. Upon being rejected, the respondent did not take quick remedial action and to resubmit his application for the relevant year, but instead he reapplied for renewal in the following year thus rendering his application as a fresh application for approval of the JKNS. In so doing, the respondent could not have a legitimate expectation for obtaining the licence upon compliance with the conditions imposed. If the respondent submitted fresh application for each year for renewal of licence, it was not surprising that the JKNS treated it as a fresh application each time it was submitted and considered it on its merits. We did not see anything inappropriate about this process seeing that a licence is subject to renewal, this might also include such matters as agreements entered into, for instance, for blood supply, for clinical waste management, for fire certificate etc. are also subject to renewal. Certainly there can be no estoppel where the application is a new application, and the requirements imposed are not shown to be contrary to or to exceed the responsibility of the respondent. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;15.;;">Section 15(1) of Act 586</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the final analysis, it must be remembered that the appellants' actions were very much to protect the health of members of the public and to ensure that maternity homes are safe to the public utilising their services as mandated by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_43;;">Act 43</LINK> and subsequently by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_586;;">Act 586</LINK> and Regulations made thereunder. The failure to appreciate this fact by the learned High Court Judge when she allowed the respondent's application and ignoring the fact that the respondent had not complied with the appellants'/JKNS' requirements before a licence could be issued to him resulted in effect in flouting of the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As such, we found that the appellants had successfully proved that the "Notis Kesalahan dan Mengelak Premis" dated 5 June 2008 was a valid notice under the law. We therefore found the closure and sealing of the said premises was not bad in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> For the reasons stated above, we unanimously allowed the appeal with costs of RM5,000.00.</p>
