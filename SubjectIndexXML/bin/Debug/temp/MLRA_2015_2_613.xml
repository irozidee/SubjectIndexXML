    <p>The appellant was charged with the murder of an Indian national, one Mohanasundaram ('deceased'), whose decomposing body was discovered floating in a disused pond. The post-mortem concluded the cause of death to be a sharp object injury to the neck and hands and blunt force trauma to the head. The prosecution's main witness was SP6 who testified that the appellant murdered the deceased in the appellant's rented house and that he had assisted the appellant in disposing of the body of the deceased as the appellant threatened to harm his wife and child. The trial proceeded mainly on the direct evidence of SP6, with the remaining evidence being essentially circumstantial evidence. The murder weapons were discovered in front of the appellant's rented house, and were received and admitted as evidence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 Evidence Act 1950 ('EA')</LINK>. The judge found a prima facie case made out at the end of the prosecution case and called upon the appellant to enter his defence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180(3) Criminal Procedure Code ('CPC')</LINK>. The appellant elected to give his evidence on oath and was the only witness for the defence. He primarily implicated SP6 in committing the murder and when questioned about the discovery of the murder weapons in a location shown by him to the police and on the basis of his recorded statement to the police, the appellant denied knowing how the said murder weapons came to be in that location. He explained away the photograph introduced in evidence showing him pointing to the murder weapons as an act directed by the police. At the end of the trial, the judge found that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The judge found SP6 truthful in his evidence and discounted the inconsistencies in his cross-examination, and that he also could not be regarded as an accomplice. As for the assistance SP6 rendered to the appellant on the disposal of the body and the non-reporting of the murder, they were acts done under threat of force. Further, there was sufficient independent corroborative evidence by way of DNA evidence, the discovery of the murder weapons under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 EA</LINK>, and the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements by three Indian nationals which proved that the motive behind the killing was a grudge the appellant had against the deceased. The appellant was accordingly convicted and sentenced to death. Hence, the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> SP6 did not confirm in cross-examination whether he was with the appellant and the deceased on the date of the murder. The learned judge incorrectly explained away the contradictions and inconsistencies by reference to SP6's then state of mind (being pre-occupied with the health of his wife and child) and the lapse of time about a year that transpired between the date of the examination-in-chief and the date of the cross-examination. SP6 was a witness to a hideous crime where the deceased was hit with an axe four times on the head, stabbed twice on the neck, dragged to the kitchen area and hit again on his hands with the axe. He could not have easily forgotten those gruesome facts, even after a year of his examination-in-chief, and even under a mental strain worrying about his wife and child. SP6 helped the appellant to carry the body that was thrown into a nearby pond. He returned to the house and fetched water for the appellant to clean the bloodstains and wipe them away with his clothes, which he lent the appellant. He then methodically disposed of the items of clothing into a nearby drain and accepted RM100 from the appellant and a handphone belonging to the deceased. It was highly improbable and in defiance of logic for SP6 to have completely forgotten those events. (paras 55-56)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The corroborative evidence did not directly and irresistibly implicate the appellant. The post-mortem merely stated the medical cause of death. It did not prove that the appellant caused the wounds leading to the death of the deceased. The DNA evidence likewise did not show the appellant as a contributory. On the other hand, there was evidence of SP6's DNA on the seized items. The presence of the "unknown contributory" was inconsequential since the previous owner and friend of the appellant had also occupied the house in which the murder took place. (para 57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> evidence could not be regarded on its own as irresistibly leading to proof that the appellant murdered the deceased using the murder weapons. It was not coupled with any admissible evidence of a confession as to the killing. (para 58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements constituted weak evidence, quite apart from being hearsay held to be admissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 EA</LINK>. It denied the appellant the opportunity to test the veracity of those statements providing motive for the murder by cross-examining the persons. The judge failed to direct his mind to the weight to be attached to that particular unsatisfactory evidence. That failure by itself could lead to a miscarriage of justice. (para 59)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The strongest or the weakest evidence remained with the direct evidence of SP6. There was reasonable doubt in the appellant's favour where a witness for the prosecution gives two sets of contradictory evidence on a fundamental matter. The inevitable conclusion was that the court would be left with no trustworthy evidence upon which a conviction could be based. The judge should have discharged and acquitted the appellant even at the close of the prosecution case, since on a maximum evaluation of the evidence, no prima facie case could be regarded as established. It was incumbent on the judge to assess on a maximum evaluation basis the credibility of SP6, which was unfortunately not done. (paras 60-61)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The decision at the end of the trial was essentially based on the issue of the believability of the appellant's evidence as against the prosecution evidence. It was not a question of whether a trial judge believed the story of the accused as truthful or not, but whether, at the end of the trial, the accused succeeded in raising a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The failure of the appellant to put a direct question to SP6 that he (SP6) was the person who caused the death of the deceased, was just a factor to be considered, and could not be determinative in a criminal trial. The general rule that if the opposing side's version of the facts was not challenged on a material matter, then it was deemed admitted, fitted more easily in a civil case and not a criminal trial, where the ultimate question was whether a reasonable doubt was raised on the prosecution's case. In any event, the question had been put directly through another witness. (para 62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> On the totality of the evidence and the law, and after considering submissions of the appellant and the prosecution, this court found that the conviction by the learned judge was unsafe. There was a miscarriage of justice requiring appellate intervention to set aside the appellant's conviction and death sentence. (para 63)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged and convicted of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> and sentenced to death by hanging. The charge read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> After considering the entirety of the Appeal Record, the Grounds of Appeal and the submissions of counsel on the facts and the law, we found the conviction and sentence handed down by the High Court was unsafe and a miscarriage of justice had been occasioned which justified a reversal of the verdict and sentence. The appeal was thus allowed and we set aside the conviction and sentence. We now provide the full reasons for the reversal of the High Court decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>A. The Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The decomposing body of the deceased was discovered floating in a disused pond behind an area described as the old KTM Quarters in the morning of 1 October 2010 by a grass cutter, SP5. The identity of the body was confirmed by SP18, a friend of the deceased. The post-mortem conducted on 5 October 2010 by SP17 (Dr Azaini bin Ibrahim, the pathologist) concluded the cause of death as "sharp object injury to the neck and hands" and "blunt force trauma to the head".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The prosecution called 22 witnesses, including one alleged eye witness, SP6 (Jaya Kumar a/l Krishnan). SP6 was the prosecution's main witness who testified to have known the deceased by the name "Mappilai" for over a year. SP6 also testified to have been a friend of the appellant who he had known for over 10 years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Aside from SP6's evidence, there were no other eye witnesses to the events which led to the alleged murder of "Mappilai" by the appellant. Thus, the case before the High Court proceeded mainly on the direct evidence of SP6, with the remaining evidence being essentially circumstantial evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The alleged murder weapons, an axe (P30) and a knife (P31), were discovered in a well located in front of the appellant's rented house and the alleged scene of the crime (the old KTM Quarters). These were received and admitted as evidence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act ("EA")</LINK>. The High Court found a <i>prima facie</i> case made out at the end of the prosecution case and called upon the appellant to enter on his defence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC")</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant elected to give his evidence on oath. There was no other witness called for the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The High Court, at the conclusion of the trial, found the prosecution had proven its case against the appellant/accused beyond reasonable doubt and thereby found him guilty as charged, and sentenced the appellant to the mandatory penalty of death by hanging.</p>
    <p>
      <b>B. The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As noted earlier, the prosecution's case relied substantially on the direct evidence of SP6, who claimed in his narration of events, to have been invited by the appellant a day before the death of the deceased (25 September 2010) to drink liquor at the accused's house in the evening of that date, ie about 7.30pm. On that evening, the appellant had told SP6 that the appellant had been scolded by "Misai", the father-in-law of the deceased, because the water and electricity charges at the toddy shop where the appellant was then working, and which was operated by Misai, had increased. It appeared that when Misai went back to India, an area dug out for a fish pond had been filled with water without Misai's consent, and the appellant had subscribed to Astro TV which he used in the premises of the toddy shop. According to SP6, the appellant had told him he intended to beat up the deceased since it was the deceased who had complained to Misai. SP6 was of the impression that the appellant was joking, but nevertheless advised him not to do so since the deceased had a family and children.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Examination-In-Chief Of SP6</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The examination-in-chief of SP6 ran as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Thus, by this testimony the appellant was vengeful against the deceased since it was the deceased who had complained to Misai, and because of that the appellant had been asked to leave the toddy shop where he was then staying.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> SP6 did not see the need to inform the deceased about the appellant's intention to harm him because SP6 thought the appellant was joking ("bergurau").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> SP6 then narrated the events on 26 September 2010, when he was again invited to have alcoholic drinks with the appellant at the appellant's house. SP6 described how the deceased was already present when he arrived at around 7.30pm, and how they all started drinking together. The appellant turned up the TV volume and informed them he was going to get some fried chicken, but instead returned with an axe with which he beat the deceased four times on the head. SP6 saw the appellant holding the axe, tried to run out of the house but the front door was locked. The appellant threatened SP6 that if he fled he (the appellant) would inform the police that SP6 did it. The appellant then retrieved a knife from a double-decker bed and stabbed the deceased thrice on his neck. The appellant dragged the deceased's body to the kitchen area near the stone steps and hit both of the deceased's hands with the axe. The appellant forced SP6 to lift the body and together with the appellant they threw the body into the pond behind the house. According to SP6, he was forced to assist, for the appellant had threatened to cause harm to SP6's daughter if he did not. The appellant then forced SP6 to fetch water from the well in front of the house, and the appellant used the water to clean up the traces of blood using some cloth and SP6's shirt in the process. The cloth and the shirt were placed by SP6 in a plastic bag thrown by SP6 into a drain beside the KTM railway track. After disposing the items, SP6 changed into a fresh pair of clothes that he had brought along with him, and returned to the appellant's house. At that point the appellant gave SP6 RM100.00 and the deceased's handphone. SP6 then went home.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The narration is best explained in SP6's own words (in examination-inchief) as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> From SP6's evidence, it was evident that this witness did not make any report on the murder nor informed anyone of it, since he was afraid of the harm that could befall his daughter if he did. As he explained it: "Lepas itu saya dengan urusan saya dan dia dengan urusan dia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> SP6 was arrested by the police on 6 October 2010 at an unnumbered house, Perkampungan Orang Asli Tebung. The police also seized a T-Shirt and trousers belonging to him. See the evidence of SP8 (ASP Mohd Zulkifli bin Yusof, the Investigating Officer) at pp 108-109, Appeal Record, vol 1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant was arrested on 7 October 2010 at IPD, Alor Gajah where he was brought after having been arrested earlier on a charge of housebreaking. (See Appeal Record, vol 1, p 110).</p>
    <p>
      <b>SP6's Cross-Examination</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> SP6 was subjected to vigorous cross-examination by counsel for the accused/appellant during the trial during which his answers were either uncertain or contradictory. Again, it is best to quote SP6's actual answers for a proper assessment to be made. The relevant parts read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The jarring inconsistencies between SP6's answers during his examinationin-chief and his answers during the cross-examination have been emphasised and underscored above. The answers varied between "Tidak tahu", "Tidak ingat", "Sudah lupa", and "Sekarang saya tidak ingat", "Kalau dulu saya boleh ingat", " Kalau tanya sekarang saya tidak ingat".</p>
    <p>
      <b>SP6's Re-Examination</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> There were attempts by DPP to repair the answers during re-examination. See the following exchange:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Alleged Corroborative Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Aside from the evidence of SP6, the prosecution relied on the scientific evidence from the post-mortem (through the evidence of SP14) and DNA evidence through SP9 (Dr Seah Lay Hong from the Chemistry Department). The DNA evidence proved that traces of blood from the KTM house occupied by the appellant matched the DNA profile of the deceased. The DNA profile from the scene of the crime, however, included a DNA profile of an "unknown contributory".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The prosecution further relied on the evidence of discovery of the axe and the knife from a location (the well) shown by the appellant, and admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act</LINK> and on the basis of the appellant's recorded statement - "Saya telah buangkan kapak dan pisau yang digunakan itu dalam telaga di tepi rumah saya di Kg Asli Tebong, dan saya boleh tunjuk tempat buang barang-barang kapak dan pisau itu ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> To establish motive, the prosecution relied on the evidence of SP15 (Periamalay a/l Muthusamy, and three <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112 CPC</LINK> statements of Mathalai (P68), Pitchaimuthu a/l Karuppiah (P72) and Selvaraj a/l Somu (P81) who were Indian Nationals who could not be traced and thus the High Court allowed these statements to be admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act</LINK>. These <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements were used to establish that the appellant had a grudge against the deceased since it was allegedly the deceased who had caused the appellant to be expelled from the house and toddy shop where he had stayed and worked for more than ten years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Counsel for the appellant had argued that SP6 was an accomplice and therefore his evidence had to be corroborated by other independent evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C. Decision At Close Of The Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> At the close of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge found there was a <i>prima facie</i> case to answer and called upon the appellant/accused to enter on his defence. In so deciding, the learned judge referred to the two leading cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_547;"><i>Balachandran v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 547</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 301; [2005] 1 CLJ 85; [2005] 1 AMR 321 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_590;"><i>PP v.

    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned judge was satisfied that the case fell within the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300(c) of the Penal Code</LINK>, ie causing death by an act "done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death."  Referring to the post-mortem evidence, injuries 1 and 3 in the report indicated these were sufficient to have caused the death, although acknowledging that it was difficult to confirm in relation to the other injuries in view of the stage of decomposition of the body. As for the person who caused the death, the learned judge was satisfied that SP6 was truthful in his evidence and discounted the inconsistencies in his cross-examination, and found further that this witness could not be regarded as an accomplice, and the assistance he rendered to the appellant on the disposal of the body and the non-reporting of the murder, were acts done under threat of force. In any event, even if SP6 were to be regarded as an accomplice in the sense of being an "accessory after the fact", there was sufficient independent corroborative evidence by way of the DNA evidence, the discovery of the murder weapons under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 Evidence Act</LINK>, and the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements by the three Indian nationals which proved the motive behind the killing. The inconsistencies in SP6's answers in cross-examination were described as "sesuatu perkara biasa yang tidak memudaratkan kredibiliti SP6".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We provide below some relevant excerpts from the judgment in relation to the finding of a <i>prima facie</i> case to answer:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>D. Case For The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The appellant narrated how he initially worked in the toddy shop which was initially owned by SP15 (Pariamalay). He worked with SP15 for about six years up to the time when the shop was taken over by Misai. He worked for Misai as a delivery man, coconut picker and a gardener for about five months until he was asked to leave the shop. At that time, Misai had employed three other workers - the deceased, Patchaimuthu and Karuppiah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> According to the appellant, he had a very close relationship with the deceased, and had no problems with him. However, his relationship with Misai was not good, since Misai would ask him to cut trees in a jungle reserve illegally to build a fence. The appellant then testified that a problem arose between him and Misai over the increases in the electricity and water charges at the toddy shop. When Misai went back to India, Pitchaimuthu had released water into the fish pond built by Misai. The appellant had also subscribed to Astro TV which the workers and the customers would watch. It was the appellant's case that arising from this understanding, Misai had asked him to leave the shop where he had been staying, leading him to rent the KTM quarters a short distance away. The appellant testified that it was not the deceased who complained to Misai but Patchaimuthu. He stopped working for Misai at that time. He then worked on his own, planting vegetables in the area of the KTM quarters, and selling these. He employed SP6 to assist him, paying him RM20-30 each time to clean the vegetable plot and extracting the chilli seeds. SP6 was then unemployed and the appellant had known him for a long time. SP6 would work at the appellant's house until 5.00 in the evening.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On 26 September 2010, the appellant explained that he had gone fishing in the evening. When he returned to the house at about 7.30pm, SP6 and the deceased were already there and drinking alcohol. According to the appellant, he did not drink with them. He questioned SP6 why he was drinking so early in the evening, to which SP6 replied he was drinking whilst cleaning chilli.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Since the house did not have clean water, and he wanted to cook rice, the appellant went to the toddy shop to obtain some water in a basin. When he returned to the house, he saw the deceased lying on the floor, and was told by SP6: "Kamu diam sahaja. Pergaduhan berlaku antara kami berdua." It was SP6 who asked him to carry the deceased, and if he did not, SP6 would stab him with the knife SP6 was carrying. SP6 asked him to place the body on SP6's shoulder and SP6 carried the body out of the house. The appellant did not know where SP6 took the body. SP6 returned 15-20 minutes thereafter and cleaned the house. SP6 told him not to report the incident to anyone else since the incident happened while he (SP6) was drunk.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The appellant made known that SP6 had a "problem" with the deceased since the deceased had previously refused to sell toddy to SP6 on credit because SP6 was always indebted to the toddy shop. When questioned on the discovery of the axe and knife as resulting from what he had told the police, the appellant denied knowing how the axe and the knife came to be in the well, and the photograph introduced in evidence showing him pointing to the weapons and the well was explained away by him saying: "Polis suruh saya tunjukkan keduadua jari pada perigi itu, saya pun tunjuk", and "Itu gambar polis membawa pisau dari perigi dan mereka suruh saya tunjuk jari pada pisau dan mereka pun ambil gambar". As stated earlier in this judgment, the appellant was the only witness for the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court At The Conclusion Of Trial</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In summary, the learned judge disbelieved the appellant's evidence and concluded it to be merely bare denials, an afterthought and difficult to believe. Further, the defence had not put and challenged SP6 directly that it was SP6 who killed the deceased. The appellant was found not to have raised a reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case, and thereby the learned judge found the appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him to the mandatory sentence of death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The learned judge applying <i>PP v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar (supra)</i>, said:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>The Submissions In The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The appellant put forth 23 grounds in his Petition of Appeal, but in the course of the appeal counsel for the appellant emphasised three main grounds which encapsulated most of the detailed grounds. These main grounds were advanced as (1) the reliability of SP6's evidence, (2) the evidence of SP6 on the issue of duress and/or his position as <i>particeps criminis</i>, and (3) the evidence relating to the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements (exhs P68, P72 and P81) of Mathalai, Pitchaimuthu a/l Karuppiah and Selvaraj a/l Somu, the three Indian nationals who could not be traced, and whether the learned judge had directed himself properly on the weight to be attached to these evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> On the first issue, it was argued that the crux of the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial and direct evidence, with the direct evidence being based on SP6's evidence alone. Without the direct evidence, the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to convict the accused since the evidence could not have led to the irresistible conclusion that the accused committed the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> SP6 was at the scene of the crime. He helped in disposing of the body. He returned to the house to assist in cleaning up the bloodstains. On his own evidence, he then fetched water from the well and lent his shirt and his clothes to wipe the bloodstains, after which he placed these in a plastic bag and threw them into a drain near the railway line. He was even paid RM100.00 for his effort and given the deceased's handphone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> He was the first person to be arrested on suspicion of murder. The appellant was arrested on the same day for suspected housebreaking and in the process was then arrested for the suspected murder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> During the cross-examination, SP6 was evasive and inconsistent in his answers, but in re-examination he seemed to remember again on what transpired on the day of the crime, as he explained it - "Saya dapat ingat kembali setelah dibaca semula oleh puan [reference to TPR] tadi".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Although SP6 was bound by law to report the crime under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;13.;;">s 13 of the CPC</LINK>, he failed to lodge any police report, and effectively kept quite for 12 days until he was arrested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The DNA evidence showed SP6's DNA on the items of clothing, but none of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> He even lied to SP11 (Jayasangkar a/l Subramaniam, to whom he gave the handphone) as to how he came by the handphone: "Dia beritahu terjumpa di bawah dan tidak tahu menggunakanya" (p 144, Appeal Record, vol 1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The defence submission impressed upon us that SP6 was not a witness of truth, and the learned judge had failed to critically evaluate his credibility on a maximum evaluation basis. Where a witness was not a truthful witness, it was argued, the court could not accept part of his evidence and reject the rest, since the principle was that where a witness for the prosecution led two sets of evidence which were contradictory with each other on a fundamental matter, the inevitable conclusion was the court would be left with no trustworthy evidence upon which a conviction could be based (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_5_36;"><i>PP v. Rajandiran Kadirveil</i> [2002] 5 MLRH 36</LINK>; [2002] 7 MLJ 77). In such a situation, the accused would be entitled to the benefit of a reasonable doubt in his favour (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_391;"><i>Yusoff Kassim v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 391</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 183; [1992] 1 CLJ 376 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_1_495;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Lee Eng Kooi</i> [1993] 1 MLRH 495</LINK>; [1993] 2 MLJ 322; [1993] 2 CLJ 534; [1993] 4 AMR 480).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> As regards the second issue on whether SP6 was an accomplice and whether conversely he was not because he was acting under duress, the evidence disclosed SP6 was an accessory after the fact and therefore an accomplice in law (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_342;"><i>Harcharan Singh &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 342</LINK>; [2005] 1 MLJ 593; [2005] 1 CLJ 11; [2005] 1 AMR 341). Referring to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;94.;;">s 94</LINK> which deals with duress or "threats", counsel for the appellant cited <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_156;"><i>Chu Tak Fai v. PP</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 156</LINK>; [1998] 4 MLJ 246; [1998] 4 CLJ 789 and the statement of law therein, stating:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> On the facts, the alleged threat was not imminent, extreme or persistent. There was an opportunity to escape. The learned judge had failed to consider this issue properly. As counsel stated it, "... it would be observed that the trial court failed to consider ... whether there was opportunity which was reasonably open to SP6, to render the death threat to himself or his family ineffective, by a safe avenue of escape or by seeking police protection".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> As regards the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements, these were damaging statements admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32(1)(i) of the Evidence Act</LINK> as basically statements of persons who could not be found in relation to statements "made in the course of, or for the purposes of, an investigation or inquiry into an offence." Since the statements, essentially hearsay in character, went to the character of the accused and were used to provide the motive for the murder, the trial judge had failed to consider the weight that should attach to the statements, and this failure constituted a fundamental misdirection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Turning to the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act</LINK> that led to the discovery of the axe and the knife in the well, it merely indicated that the accused took the police to the location or that he threw the axe and the knife that were used into the well. This evidence did not directly prove that the accused/appellant committed the murder on the basis of the admissible evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> It was submitted for the appellant that on the evidence before the court at the conclusion of the trial, either SP6 or the appellant, or both, could have committed the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Counsel was candid enough to concede that no question was put directly to SP6 in the cross-examination that he committed the crime, but that same question was put to another witness, SP22 (ASP T Gunasegaran, the Investigation Officer) who disagreed with the suggestion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> On the evidence before the trial court, counsel submitted that the conviction was unsafe. The trial judge had not done a correct evaluation of the evidence, and no elimination process was done to exclude SP6 as the person who committed the crime. In view of the unsatisfactory nature of SP6's evidence as the only direct evidence, and the version of the facts given by the accused/appellant himself, there were gaps in the prosecution case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In summary, DPP submitted the trial judge was correct in not finding that SP6 was an accomplice since SP6 was acting under a threat which was continuing in nature. Further the judge had directed his mind to the necessary caution that corroboration was required, and directed our attention to p 26 of the Appeal Record, vol 1, and the reference to the following passage in the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The trial judge was satisfied the post-mortem report, the DNA report and the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> discovery of the murder weapons were corroborative evidence to lend credibility to the eye-witness account by SP6.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> As to the submission that SP6 was the person who committed the crime, DPP underscored the fact that this was not put directly to SP6 in crossexamination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Adverting to the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements, DPP impressed upon us that SP20 (ASP Zabidi bin Kadir) had explained how the police had undertaken reasonable steps to locate the three Indian nationals, by tracing their movements to Kapar, Kelang and Sungai Petani, as well as checking and confirming with the Immigration Department whether they had left Malaysia. Pitchaimuthu had left Malaysia on 7 August 2011, but there was no record on this for Selvaraj and Mathalai, who were believed to have stayed on illegally in Malaysia since their visit passes had expired. These attempts satisfied the stringent requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 Evidence Act</LINK>. In any event, it was further argued, the trial judge did not rely fundamentally on these <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>This Court's Analysis And Conclusions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Given the gravity of the offence and the death sentence, the paramount issue that had to be decided was whether on the evidence before the trial court, there had been a proper judicial evaluation of the evidence by the trial judge in a situation where the only direct evidence was the testimony of SP6, an alleged eye-witness, who proved to be inconsistent and in fact contradicted himself on the fundamental aspects of the evidence linking the appellant with the commission of the crime. The salient part of his cross-examination have been quoted extensively in this judgment, but it bears emphasis that this witness could not even confirm in cross-examination whether he was with the appellant and the deceased on 26 September 2010, ie the date of the incident. To recapitulate, these were his ambivalent answers:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> At the close of the prosecution case, the learned trial judge was satisfied that on a maximum evaluation of the evidence, the prosecution had proven a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180 of the CPC</LINK>, and explained away the contradictions and inconsistencies by reference to this witness's then state of mind (being pre-occupied with the health of his wife and child) and the lapse of time that had transpired between the date of the examination-in-chief and the date of the cross-examination, which was a lapse of about a year. With respect, we could not agree with this assessment. A person who was portrayed as being a witness to a hideous crime where the victim was hit with an axe four times on the head, stabbed twice on the neck, dragged to the kitchen area and hit again on his hands with the axe, could not have forgotten the gruesome facts that easily, even after a year after his examination-in-chief, and even when under some mental strain worrying about the health of his wife and child. This same witness, allegedly under duress, and on his own evidence, helped the accused to carry the body which was thrown into the pond, returned to the house and fetched water for the accused to clean the bloodstains for which he even lent his clothes to wipe away the bloodstains, subsequently methodically disposing the items of clothing into a drain nearby, and thereafter accepted RM100 from the appellant and a handphone belonging to the deceased. It was highly improbable and in defiance of logic for the witness to have completely forgotten these events.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The learned judge was also swayed by the corroborative evidence, but these, in our view, did not directly and irresistibly link the evidence with the accused. The post-mortem merely stated medically the cause of death. It did not prove irresistibly that the accused cause the wounds which led to the death. The DNA evidence likewise did not show the appellant as a contributory. On the other hand, there was evidence of SP6's DNA on the seized items. The presence of the "unknown contributory", however, was inconsequential, since on the evidence the house had been occupied by SP3, the previous owner and friend of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act</LINK> too could not be regarded on its own as irresistibly leading to proof that these weapons were used by the appellant to murder the deceased. It was not coupled with any admissible evidence of a confession as to the killing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112</LINK> statements too constituted weak evidence, quite apart from being hearsay held to be admissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act</LINK>. It denied the opportunity for the appellant to test the veracity of these statements providing motive for the murder by cross-examining these persons. On this we agreed with the appellant's position that the trial judge had failed to direct his mind to the weight to be attached to this particular unsatisfactory evidence. This failure by itself could lead to a miscarriage of justice. An accused person is entitled to a fair trial and where an accused loses a chance of acquittal which is fairly open to him because of a substantial miscarriage of justice occasioned by a misdirection by the trial judge, the conviction becomes unsafe.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> All said, the strongest or the weakest evidence remained with the direct evidence of SP6. In this connection, we agreed with the submission by appellant's counsel that the court should accept the existence of a reasonable doubt in the accused's favour where a witness for the prosecution led two sets of evidence which were contradictory with each other on a fundamental matter, the inevitable conclusion was the court would be left with no trustworthy evidence upon which a conviction could be based.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> With respect, in our view, the trial judge should have discharged and acquitted the accused even at the close of the prosecution case, since on a maximum evaluation of the evidence, no <i>prima facie</i> case could be regarded as established. It was incumbent on the trial judge to assess on a maximum evaluation basis the credibility of SP6, which was unfortunately not done arising from an improper judicial evaluation and appreciation of the totality of the witness's evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> As for the decision at the end of the trial, we found a serious misdirection on the part of the trial judge when the decision was essentially based on the issue of the believability of the appellant's evidence as against the prosecution evidence. The law on this has been well-established: it is not a question of whether a trial judge believes the story of the accused is truthful or not, but whether, at the end of the trial, the accused has succeeded in raising a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. In our view, the failure of appellant's counsel to put a direct question to SP6 that he (SP6) was the person who caused the death of Mapillai, the deceased, was just a factor to be considered , and in a criminal trial could not be determinative. The general rule that if the opposing side's version of the facts is not challenged on a material matter, then it is deemed admitted, fits more easily in a civil case, not a criminal trial, where the ultimate question is whether a reasonable doubt has been raised in the prosecution case. In any event, the question was put directly through another witness, ie SP22.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> On the totality of the evidence and the law, and after considering submissions of counsel and DPP, we found the conviction by the High Court in this appeal unsafe. There was a miscarriage of justice which required us to set aside the conviction and the sentence of death of the High Court. The appellant was thereby acquitted and discharged.</p>
