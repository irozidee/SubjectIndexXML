    <p>The appellant and several others had sued the 3rd respondent over a dispute involving the ownership of land held under Native Land Title ("Native Land"). During the trial, the 3rd respondent had relied on his Native Certificate - which declared him to be a native - to entitle him to own the Native Land. The appellant complained that the 3rd respondent's Native Certificate was either forged or did not exist at all. He thus applied by letter to the 1st respondent to review the Native Certificate issued to the 3rd respondent under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Interpretation (Definition of Native) Ordinance (Sabah Cap 64) ("the Ordinance")</LINK>. The 1st respondent however rejected the application on <i>inter alia</i> the grounds that it had no power to do so under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>, and that the appellant was not an aggrieved applicant for a Native Certificate that had been refused by the Native Court. The appellant applied for judicial review in the High Court. However the High Court dismissed the application on the basis that the appellant did not have the <i>locus standi</i> under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal where the following two main issues arose for determination: (i) whether the appellant had the <i>locus standi</i> under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> to make the application; and (ii) whether the 1st respondent had the jurisdiction to entertain such application for review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal with costs)</p>
    <p>Per Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA delivering the majority judgment of the court:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The expression "final decision" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(4) of the Ordinance</LINK> with regards to a declaration by a Native Court as to the native status of any person is only final and conclusive for all purposes related thereto after the declaration has been subject to a review or an appeal either to the District Officer or to a Board of Officers appointed by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri for that purpose pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It is the general principle of construction that where the words of a statute are not ambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning and the court should not read any additional words or expressions into the statute in order to arrive at or to give meanings to those words as the court thinks what they should be. One must also have regard to the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> so as to achieve a harmonious construction amongst various provisions of a statute. In the instant case, the High Court did not refer to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A</LINK>. The court must apply the basic principle as to the construction of statutes that is to give the words of a statute their plain and ordinary meaning with the view of promoting the purpose of the statute as envisaged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A</LINK>. (paras 28-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The Ordinance was made for the purpose of providing a more precise definition of the expression "native" under any written law applicable to the State of Sabah in force at the commencement of the Ordinance or any written law coming to force after the commencement of the Ordinance. There are only two exclusions from this statement of purpose. First, the interpretation of the expression "native" in the Ordinance does not apply to the Ordinances set out in the Schedule to the Ordinance. Secondly, it does not apply to any expression of "native" if such expression has been given an express definition or meaning in the written laws which were either in force at the time of the commencement or that came into force after the commencement of the Ordinance. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> It is not quite correct to say that subsections (1), (2) and (3) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK> are interrelated in such a manner that they can be termed as a 'nesting provisions' because the earlier provisions were made subject to the later provisions. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">Section 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> uses the expression "any declaration" as a general expression. The phrase imports a wide meaning. If what was meant was that it only concerned the aggrieved applicant, then it would have been couched as "any declaration adverse to the applicant" because that would probably be the only situation where a declaration made by the 1st respondent could be challenged. The phrase "any declaration" must include, any declaration which may not be adverse against the applicant but may be adverse to third parties who may not be parties in the application, but who may however have interest in the status of the applicant declared as a native. (paras 36-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The manner of drafting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> does not support the High Court judge in his construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>. A plain reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Ordinance</LINK> would seem to suggest that an application to a Native Court for declaration of a native status of Sabah may be made <i>ex parte</i>. There is nothing in the section or in the Ordinance itself that requires an applicant to serve his or her application for such declaration on any party. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">Section 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> is also silent as to the party or person who may seek a review of the declaration made by a Native Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(2) of the Ordinance</LINK> to a District Officer or Board of Officers appointed by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri for that purpose. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> An unsuccessful applicant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Ordinance</LINK> would, in all circumstances be able to appeal to a District Officer or Board of Officers against the refusal of a Native Court to grant the declaration instead of relying on the power of review or revision or scrutiny of the District Officer or the Board of Officers. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> With regard to any appeal in respect of any declaration made by the Native Court, such appeal would necessarily be confined to the applicant and the respondent before the Native Court. An appeal must be, as a general rule, made by the parties who are aggrieved by the decision of the Native Court in respect of the declaration made by it under subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>. (para 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> In order for an applicant to have <i>locus standi</i> to file for a judicial review, the applicant has to show he has a real and genuine interest in the subject matter. In the instant case, it was obvious on the factual matrix of the appellant's complaint in the High Court in the civil suit and his letters to the 1st respondent, that the appellant had a real and genuine interest in the subject matter, to wit, the declaration as to the native status of the 3rd respondent. The two issues for the determination of the Court of Appeal had to be answered in the affirmative. <i>Malaysian Trade Union Congress &amp; Ors v. Menteri Tenaga, Air &amp; Komunikasi &amp; Anor (folld)</i>. (paras 41-43)</p>
    <p>Per Rohana Yusuf JCA (dissenting):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The grounds of application cited in the appellant's application for judicial review were of no relevance to the instant appeal. The 1st respondent did not consider the merits of the appellant's application for review because according to the 1st respondent, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>, the appellant was not entitled to apply for a revision of the Native's Court decision to the 1st respondent. (para 49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">Section 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> must be construed in its plain and ordinary meaning. It must not be confused with the test of "adversely affected person". The word "adversely affected person" is not mentioned in s 3(3) and cases on <i>locus standi</i> applying such were therefore of no consequence. Where the words give rise to a different meaning, then a purposive approach would have to be adopted. A statute must be read and construed as a whole and not be taken in isolation. (paras 52-53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Reading the provisions in context and as a whole, there was no room for a third person to lodge an appeal under s 3(3) against the decision made by the Native Court. That right was only opened to the applicant before the Native Court under s 3(1) which surely would have been the 3rd respondent in the context of the instant appeal. The court could not read into s 3(3) by adding into it, any other person than the applicant. (para 58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the test of "adversely affected person" to determine locus for a judicial review did not apply. Even if it could be argued that an "adversely affected" test may be read into s 3(3), the appellant had not demonstrated how he was affected especially when he and the other plaintiffs in the civil suit had their ownership to their land restored by the High Court. (para 61)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The 1st respondent in the instant case had correctly interpreted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>. The decision of the 1st respondent was therefore not irrational or suffered from <i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness. There was no good reason for the decision of the 1st respondent to be impugned and the appeal of the appellant ought to be dismissed. (para 62)</p>

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant who was the applicant before the High Court against the decision of YA David Wong Dak Wah J given at Kota Kinabalu High Court on 25 May 2012 dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review against the 1st respondent's decision dated 21 January 2012 which ruled that the 1st respondent has no power to review the Native Certificate issued to and held by 3rd respondent in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard the appeal on 19 May 2014 and 22 May 2014. We then adjourned the matter for deliberation. We have reached a decision; but it is a split decision. My learned brother Justice Abang Iskandar and I had agreed that this appeal be allowed. However, our learned sister Justice Rohana Yusuf holds a different view as stated in her dissenting judgment. We, the majority, now give our reasons for our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> To be noted is that the 3rd respondent is neither a party to the Judicial Review No: BKI-13JR-5/2 (the subject matter of this appeal before the High Court at Kota Kinabalu) nor a party in the proceeding before the 1st respondent's under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Interpretation (Definition of Native) Ordinance (Sabah Cap 64)</LINK> ("the Ordinance").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> However, in the judicial review proceedings before the High Court, the 3rd respondent was served with the cause papers and opportunity was given to the 3rd respondent's counsel to tender his submissions on the applicant's / appellant's application for judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The background facts to the judicial review before the High Court and also the review before the 1st respondent under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> are as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> By a suit (S-21-62-2009), the appellant and 97 others had sued Chua (the 3rd respondent) in respect of a dispute as to the ownership of various parcels of native title land totaling 395.62 acres at Sungai Sugut, Labuk, Sabah (Native Lands). The legal basis of the suit was grounded on misrepresentation, nonest factum and inequality of bargaining power. During the trial of that suit, the 3rd respondent had relied on his Native Certificate (which declared that he is a native) to entitle him to own the Native Lands. Learned counsel for the appellant informed the court that in view of undisputed case law, (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_504;"><i>Datuk Syed Kechik Bin Syed Mohamed v. Government Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 504</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 101 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_396;"><i>Joseph Paulus Lantip v. Lian Kee Chu &amp; Ors</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 396</LINK>), the appellant could not challenge the authenticity of the 3rd respondent's Native Certificate in that suit itself and his only revenue was to seek a review before the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant had referred to the 1st respondent his complaint to have the Native Certificate issued to and held by the 3rd respondent reviewed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> vide a letter dated 16 March 2011. The gist of the complaint was that the Native Certificate issued to and held by the 3rd respondent was either forged or did not exist at all. In his letter the appellant cited correspondences from various public and private sources purportedly stating that the Native Certificate in the possession of the 3rd respondent did not exist as it was never issued by the relevant Native Court, namely, the Native Court of Beluran.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant alleged that the 3rd respondent's Native Certificate was "either forged or did not exist at all" because the 3rd respondent's mother was not one "Mariamah binti Berahim" of Sino-Brunei descent as the 3rd respondent had testified that both his parents are from China.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 20 January 2012, the 1st respondent rejected the application by the appellant to review the status of the Native Certificate issued to the 3rd respondent in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In its written decision delivered on 20 January 2012 in respect of the application for review by the appellant, the 1st respondent had stated the reasons for dismissing the application as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In the judicial review proceedings before the High Court it was submitted for the appellant that to construe <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> narrowly by limiting the class of people who are entitled to seek for review of the Native Certificate to only applicants for Native Certificate is irrational on ground of "<i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness". It was argued that the interpretation which the 1st respondent give to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> is so outrageous that it will result in absurdity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant also argued before the High Court that his <i>locus standi</i> in the judicial review cannot be questioned as he is a native of Sabah and, he and 97 natives were involved in a court dispute concerning ownership of the Native Lands with the 3rd respondent who had in his testimony in court relied on his Native Certificate to justify his ability to hold the Native Lands. Further, it was argued before the learned trial judge that, to sustain the 1st respondent's construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> would mean that the appellant would be denied his right of access to justice which would infringe <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> which states that "all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In dealing with the judicial review application before him, the learned High Court Judge was of the view that the crux of the application is undisputedly the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>. Section 3 is re-produced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Applying the principle stated by Seah SCJ in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_609;"><i>NKM Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Pan Malaysia Wood Bhd</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 609</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 39, the learned judge held that in constructing any provision of a statute the court is not concerned with the policy of the statute. In other words, the court is not concerned with the consideration as to why the statute was introduced in the first place. The learned judge went on to say that the words employed by the legislature in a statute must be given their plain and natural meaning; if however the words used attract different meanings, then the court must adopt a purposive approach in interpreting or in the construction of a provision in a given statute. We have no quarrel with this principle. Indeed, our view is that in interpreting a statute, the court must have regard to the purpose of the statute (this is the purposive approach). And in doing so the court must give the words used in the statute their plain and ordinary meaning. We think it is not correct to say that the purposive approach is resorted to only when, applying the plain and ordinary meaning to the words of a statute, it gives rise to different meanings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Having said that, we noted that the learned judge was also of the view that the sole purpose of the Ordinance is to provide mechanism to people who are qualified under the Ordinance to apply to a Native Court to have his status declared as a native of Sabah as defined in the same Ordinance. The learned judge further held that the Ordinance does not contain any specific provision for challenge by third party before or after the declaration of the native status. The learned judge disagreed with learned counsel for the appellant's suggestion that the court must read into <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> to allow strangers or third party with interest to intervene in the application proceeding for native status. The reason for this is explained by the learned judge in his judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Therefore, the learned judge held that the natural inference is that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>, the review or the appeal to the Board of Officers (the 1st respondent) could only refer to person who had failed to obtain a declaration as to his or her native status before the Native Court. The learned High Court judge held further that those natives who were unsuccessful in their claim for native status would still have a remedy to right any incorrect decision of the Native Court by resorting to the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1992_003;16.;;">s 16 of the Native Courts Enactment 1992</LINK> which gives a District Native Court a power of revision by calling and examine the records of proceedings of a Native Court in order to satisfy itself as "to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of such court." In his final analysis therefore, the learned judge concluded that the appellant does not have <i>locus standi</i> under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We are of the view that there are two primary issues in this appeal. The first issue is whether the appellant has the <i>locus standi</i> under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> to make the application to the 1st respondent to review a declaration made by a Native Court in exercising of its powers under the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1992_003;16.;;">Native Courts Enactment 1992 (in particular s 16)</LINK> on the native status of a third party when the appellant is not a party to the application for the declaration of the native status of that third party pursuant to subsection 3 of the Ordinance before the Native Court. The second issue is whether the Board of Officers, (ie the 1st respondent) has the jurisdiction to entertain such application for review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the same Ordinance</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> To address these issues we will start by looking at the scope of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;;">the Ordinance Cap 64</LINK> which came into force on 10 December 1989.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> To be noted, the short title to the Interpretation Ordinance is stated as "The Interpretation (Definition of Native) Ordinance". The long title is stated as "To define the expression 'native' in a more precise manner and to make certain consequential provision thereon". It is obvious therefore that the purpose of the Ordinance is to provide for a clear and precise definition of the expression 'native' and to provide for consequential provisions relating thereto. This purpose is made clearer by the provisions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(1) and (2) of the Ordinance</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">Section 2(1) of the Ordinance</LINK> provides that wherever the word 'native' used as a substantive, occurs in any written law enforced at the commencement of the Ordinance or any written law coming into force after the commencement of the Ordinance, unless expressly otherwise enacted in the respective Ordinances or written law, shall have the meaning ascribed to it in one of the paras (a), (b), (c), or (d) of the said s 2(1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The definition of expression 'native' under paras (a), (b), (c) or (d) is further clarified by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Ordinance</LINK>. However, to rely on the definition of 'native' given under subsection (1)(b), (c) and (d) and subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2 of the Ordinance</LINK> is not sufficient to give recognition to any person as a native of Sabah. This is because <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(3)</LINK> of the same Ordinance provides that no claim by any person to be a native by virtue of the provisions of paras (b), (c) and (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(1) of the Ordinance</LINK> shall be recognised as valid unless supported by an appropriate declaration made by a Native Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> At this point it is pertinent to note that under paras (a) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(1) of the Ordinance</LINK>, a person whose parent are or were members of a people indigenous to Sabah does not require a declaration of his or her status as native by a Native Court for such person to be recognised as native of Sabah. But, for a person claiming to be native of Sabah under paras (b), (c) and (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(1) of the Ordinance</LINK>, a declaration by a Native Court as to the person's native status is required for purposes of a valid recognition of such status. It is also to be noted that one of the criteria for a person to claim that he or she is native of Sabah under para (b), (c) and (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(1) of the Ordinance</LINK>, such person must ordinarily be resident in Sabah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It is settled law that on the authorities cited earlier in this judgment that the Native Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and determine an application for declaration of a native status made to it by any person. However, that exclusive jurisdiction is qualified by subsections (2) and (3) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>. Subsection (2) reads 'subject to subsection (3) of this section, (ie s 3) ... any Native Court ... shall have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and determine any such application and to make such declaration ...' (the word in bracket is added for emphasis). Subsection (3) provides 'any declaration of any Native Court made in exercise of jurisdiction confer upon it by s 2 shall be subject to review by, an appeal to the District Officer or a Board of Officers appointed by Yang di-Pertua Negeri for that purpose'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is also pertinent to note that subsection (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK> is couched in the following words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Looking at the scheme of things in the Ordinance, it appears to us that the expression "final decision" in subsection (4) of the Ordinance quoted above, with regards to a declaration by a Native Court as to the native status of any person is only final and conclusive for all purposes related thereto after the declaration had been subject to a review or an appeal (if any) either to the District Officer or to a Board of Officers appointed by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri for that purpose pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On this issue of finality as to the declaration of a native status by a Native Court in Sabah, we observed that in the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_504;"><i>Datuk Syed Kechik Bin Syed Mohamed v. Government Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 504</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 101, Lee Hun Hoe CJ (Borneo) at p 108 of the report whilst stating that the Native Court have the exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and determine an application for a declaration of a native status, also acknowledged that that declaration maybe appealed against under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> as if it were proceeding or order of the court. However, in that case there was no appeal against the declaration which was in issue; so therefore the declaration in that case was final and binding pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(4) of the Ordinance</LINK>. We also observe that the court in that case did not consider the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> as to the issue of <i>locus standi</i> of an applicant or the jurisdiction of the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Now, we return to the question of interpretation and construction of a provision of statute. First, we state the general principle. The law reports are replete with cases on the principles of construction of statute. The general principle is that where the words used in the statute are clear and unambiguous then those words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning. In such cases there is no question of construction. It has been said that the basic task of the court is to give effect to the true meaning of what Parliament had intended. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_212;"><i>Lau Keen Fai v. Lim Ban Kay &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 212</LINK>; [2012] 2 MLJ 8; [2012] 1 CLJ 569, Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin CJ (Malaya) said as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_712;"><i>Thein Hong Teck &amp; Ors v. Mohd Afrizan Husain &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 712</LINK>; [2012] 2 MLJ 299; [2012] 1 CLJ 49; [2012] 1 AMR 489, the Federal Court in emphasising the same principle had said that "it is not the function of the court to rewrite the statute in a way in which
it considers reasonable. In other words, the court is not entitled to read words into a provision of a statute". The court then went on to quote the following passage by Lord Loreburn LC in <i>Vickers, Sons and Maxim Ltd v. Evans</i> [1910] AC 444:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In yet another case Mohd Ghazali FJ in delivering one of the judgments in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_23;"><i>Dr Koay Cheng Boon v. Majlis Perubatan Malaysia</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 23</LINK>; [2012] 3 MLJ 173; [2012] 4 CLJ 445, had said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Thus, from all the authorities cited above, it is the general principle of construction that where the words of a statute are not ambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning and the court should not read any additional words or expressions into the statute in order to arrive or to give meanings to those words as the court thinks what it should be. However, one must also have regard to the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> so as to achieve a harmonious construction amongst various provisions of a statute. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">Section 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We notice that in his judgment, the learned High Court Judge had not referred to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> as cited above, though His Lordship did mention that if the words of a statute are capable of more than one interpretation then the court must resort to the purposive approach in the construction of the relevant provisions of a statute that the court was asked to interpret. We take a different view. We are of the view that first and foremost the court must apply the basic principle as to the construction of statute that is to give the words of a statute their plain and ordinary meaning with the view of promoting the purpose of the statute as envisaged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In construing of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_FS_ACT_yyyy_actno;sectionno.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>, the learned High Court Judge held the view that the sole purpose of the Ordinance is to provide a mechanism to people who are qualified under the Ordinance to apply to a Native Court to have his status declared as a native of Sabah. The learned judge went further to state that the Ordinance does not contain any specific provisions for challenge by a third party before or after the declaration of the native status. The learned High Court Judge disagreed with the suggestion by the learned counsel for the appellant before him that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> allows strangers or third party with interest to intervene in the application proceeding for native status. The reasons given by His Lordship for disagreeing with this suggestion are firstly, he said that "if that was the intention of the legislators; they could have easily put the words 'subject to appeal for review by a party apart from the person claiming to be a native for native status' or similar words to that effect in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Interpretation Ordinance</LINK>." And it is an established rule of construction that the court should not insert words into a legislation. In the words of learned judge the court task is "to interpret and not to legislate". The second reason given by the learned judge is that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1), (2) and (3) of the Ordinance</LINK> are interrelated or to borrow the expression used by learned counsel for the 1st respondent, are a series of 'nesting provisions'. The argument for this proposition is that each of the subsection is made subject to the subsection immediately preceding it and the learned High Court Judge held that this "leads to the natural conclusion that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1)</LINK> is the parent provision with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(2) and (3)</LINK> as the offspring provision so to speak." It is the view of the learned High Court Judge that the Ordinance "was created by the legislators to ensure that qualified persons are not disenfranchised from their rights to be called as natives of Sabah and hence obtaining the protection and privilege accorded to them by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;153.;;">art 153(2) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In the result, the learned High Court Judge made two conclusions based on his analysis of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>. The first conclusion is that in his view, "the natural inference is that the review or appeal to the 1st respondent could only refer to the person who had failed to obtain native status before the Native Court." His Lordship's second conclusion is that for those who were successful in their claim for declaration of their natives status, such declaration could be called for revision by the District Native Court pursuant to its power of revision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1992_003;16.;;">s 16 of the Native Courts Enactment 1992</LINK> for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceeding of a Native Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Though we agree with the learned High Court Judge's statement on the law, that is, it is an established rule of construction that the court should not insert words into a legislation, we have a different view as to His Lordship's construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK> as regard to the so called 'nesting provisions' and the natural inference that only a person who was unsuccessful in obtaining a declaration as to his native status can apply for a review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> either to a Native Court or to the Board of Officers and His Lordship's view as to the purpose of the Ordinance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Our reasons are as follows. Firstly, as to the purpose of the Ordinance, it is quite obvious from the reading of the long title of the Ordinance that the Ordinance was made for the purpose of providing a more precise definition of the expression "native" under any written law applicable to the State of Sabah in force at the commencement of the Ordinance (which was 10 December 1952) or any written law coming to force after the commencement of this Ordinance. There are only two exclusions from this statement of purpose. First, the interpretation of the expression "native" in the Ordinance does not apply to the Ordinances set out in the Schedule to the Ordinance. Secondly, it does not apply to any expression of "native" if such expression has been given an express definition or meaning in the written laws which either in force at the time of the commencement or that come into force after the commencement of the Ordinance. What this means in our view is that if the expression "native" appears in any written law in force at the commencement or that comes into force after the commencement of the Ordinance, then in order to ascertain whether a person claiming to be a native is in fact a native of Sabah, resort must be made to the provisions of the Ordinance in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3</LINK>. If the person claims that he is a native by virtue of para (a) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(1) of the Ordinance</LINK>, such person must show that both of his parents are or were members of a people indigenous to Sabah. If a person claims he is a native by virtue of paras (b), (c) and (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;2.;;">s 2(1) of the Ordinance</LINK>, such person must show that he had met all the requirements of the relevant paragraphs of that subsection (1). In addition to that, and to have his or her claim valid, such person would be required to have a declaration made by a Native Court pursuant to an application made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Ordinance</LINK> that he or she is a native.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Secondly, we do not think that it is quite correct to say that subsections (1), (2) and (3) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK> are interrelated in such a manner that it can be termed as a 'nesting provisions' because the earlier provisions were made subject to the later provisions. The subsections are interrelated no doubt; however the qualifier 'subject to the provision of subsection (3) of this section, ...' in subsection (2) only relates to subsection (3) in respect of the exclusivity of the jurisdiction of a Native Court to entertain and determine at the application for a declaration as to the native status of an applicant. By this qualifier it seems to us that the exclusive jurisdiction of a Native Court in respect of such application does not means finality in its determination. This is because subsection (3) provides that the exercise of the jurisdiction is '... subject to review and scrutiny by, and appeal to the District Officer or a Board of Officers appointed by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri for the purpose.'</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Thirdly, the wording of subsection (3) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK> starts with the expression 'Any declaration of any Native Court ...' There is no qualifier in subsection (3). For example, the subsection does not confine itself to the applicant or an aggrievedparty before the Native Court or the Board of Officers before a review and scrutiny can be done by the District Officer or a Board of Officers. It is also pertinent to note that in the subsection, after the expression 'subject to review and scrutiny by' there is a comma then followed by the expression 'an appeal to'. This, in our mind shows that the review and the scrutiny of the exercise of any declaration can be made either at the instant of the District Officer or a Board of Officers appointed by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri for the purpose on its own volition or on an application or at the instant of any interested party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> It is pertinent to note that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> uses the expression "any declaration" as a general expression. To our minds, this phrase imports a wide meaning. If what was meant that it only concerns the aggrieved applicant, then it would have been couched as "any declaration adverse to the applicant" because that would probably be the only situation where a declaration made by the 1st respondent may be challenged. We cannot think of any other declaration which may be challenged by the applicant as regards the outcome of his application to be recognised as a native of Sabah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> But, by employing the phrase as it did, to wit "any declaration", that must include, any declaration which may not be adverse against the applicant but it may be adverse to third parties who may not be parties in the application, but who may however have interest in the status of the applicant declared as native.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The choice of such phrase, to our minds, has opened the door for third parties with real interests, such as the appellant here, to be allowed in and be heard about their grievance arising out of the declaration of the 3rd respondent as native of Sabah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The subsection does not contain any expression such as "an aggrieved person or party" or such similar words or expression in relation to the expression "any declaration". This manner of drafting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> certainly does not support the conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in His Lordship's construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>. A plain reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Ordinance</LINK> would seem to suggest that an application to a Native Court for declaration of a native status of Sabah may be made <i>ex parte</i>. There is nothing in the section or for that matter in the Ordinance itself that requires an applicant to serve his or her application for such declaration on any party. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">Section 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> is also silent as to the party or person who may seek a review of the declaration made by a Native Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(2) of the Ordinance</LINK> to a District Officer or Board of Officers appointed by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri for that purpose. In this regard, we are also of the view that the reasoning by the 1st respondent, in rejecting the appellant's application on the ground that it has no power to hear the application because it had read the phrase "Any person claiming to be a native ..." in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Ordinance</LINK> together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> of the same Ordinance and conclude that the person who is the subject of a revision or scrutiny under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> must necessarily be the person claiming to be a native under subsection (1) is flawed. We say so because we find nothing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) and 3(3) of the Ordinance</LINK> that warrants such reading of the two provisions. Further, we are of the view that an unsuccessful applicant under subsection (1) would, in all circumstances be able to appeal to a District Officer or Board of Officers against the refusal of a Native Court to grant the declaration instead of relying on the power of review or revision or scrutiny of the District Officer or the Board of Officers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> However, with regard to the appeal in respect of any declaration made by the Native Court, the appeal would, in our opinion necessarily be confined to the applicant and the respondent before the Native Court. We say so because it is common sense that an appeal must be, as a general rule, made by the parties who are aggrieved by the decision of the Native Court in respect of the declaration made by it under subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of the Ordinance</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> At this juncture, we would refer to the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_2_1;"><i>Malaysian Trade Union Congress &amp; Ors v. Menteri Tenaga, Air &amp; Komunikasi &amp; Anor</i> [2014] 2 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 145; [2014] 2 CLJ 525; [2014] 2 AMR 101, where the court had ruled that in order for an applicant to have <i>locus standi</i> to file for a judicial review, the applicant had to show he had a real and genuine interest in the subject matter. In that case the Federal Court had to deal with the issue of <i>locus standi</i> in respect of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress (MTUC) as an applicant to have access to a copy of concession agreement and the audit report justifying 15% increase in water tariff. MTUC had earlier applied to the Minister in charge of power, water and communication to have a copy of the two documents in the light of Syabas's (the water concessioner in Federal Territory and Selangor) application for an increase of the water tariff by 15% and the approval by the Minister of that application. The Minister refused the MTUC the rights to have access to the two documents. MTUC with 13 Others then filed an application for judicial review of the Minister's decision refusing them access to the two documents, seeking an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the Minister's decision and for an order of <i>mandamus</i> directing the Minister to disclose the two documents. At the High Court, the judicial review was allowed. One of the reasons was that the High Court found that the appellant in that case have <i>locus standi</i> to bring the action, the appellant being paying water consumers in the area covered by the concession agreement. On appeal to the Court of Appeal by the respondent, the Court of Appeal by majority allowed the appeal on the ground that though MTUC had satisfied the test of threshold <i>locus standi</i>, the 2nd to 14th appellants had not satisfied the test. The appellant then appealed against the Court of Appeal's decision to the Federal Court; and the Federal Court speaking through the judgment of Hasan Lah FCJ dismissed the appeal on the ground that the audit report was an official secret document for the purposes of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_88;2.;;">s 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1972</LINK> and the two documents cannot be disclosed by the Minister to a third party without the agreement of the other parties to the concession agreement by virtue of cl 45 of the concession agreement. However, on the issue of <i>locus standi</i> the Federal Court found for the appellant MTUC because MTUC had shown a real and genuine interest in the subject matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In our present case the facts as found in the suit S-21-62-2009, the applicant and 97 Others had sued the 3rd respondent in respect of a dispute as to the ownership of various parcels of native title land totaling 395.62 acres at Sungai Sugut, Labuk, Sabah (Native Lands). The legal basis of the suit was grounded on misrepresentation, <i>non est factum</i> and inequality of bargaining power. During the trial of that suit, the 3rd respondent had relied on his Native Certificate (which declared that he is a native) to entitle him to own the Native Lands. Then, in his letter of complaint dated 16 March 2011 to the Board of Officers, the appellant had complained amongst others that the Native Certificate issued to and held by the 3rd respondent was either forged or did not exist at all. The appellant cited in his letter correspondences from various public and private sources purportedly stating that the Native Certificate in the possession of the 3rd respondent did not exist as it was never issued by the relevant Native Court, namely, the Native Court of Beluran. Applying the principle as to the test to be applied in respect of the issue as to <i>locus standi</i> as propounded by the Federal Court in <i>Malaysian Trade Union Congress &amp; Ors (supra)</i>, it is obvious on the factual matrix of the applicant's complaint in the High Court in suit S-21-62-2009 and his letters to the Board of Officers, (ie the 1st respondent), the appellant had a real and genuine interest in the subject matter to wit the declaration as to the native status of the 3rd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> On the above reasons, we are of the opinion that the two issues identified earlier in this judgment which require our determination must be answered in the affirmative. Accordingly, we will allow the appeal with costs.</p>

      <b>Rohana Yusuf JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The appellant, Madlis Azid @ Aziz, was earlier a litigant in a civil suit before the High Court at Sandakan vide Suit No: S-21-62-2009 against one, Chua Yong Kim (Chua). In that civil suit the appellant and 97 others filed a claim against Chua over a dispute in the ownership of native lands totalling 395.62 acres situated at Sungai Sugut, Labuk, Sabah (Native Lands). In that suit, Chua, in reliance on a Native Certificate issued by the Native Court, maintained that he is a Native and is therefore entitled to stake his claim over the Native Lands.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> At all material times, the appellant was mindful of the various decided cases that affirmed the exclusiveness of the Native Court's power to declare any person a Native. This exclusive power is granted pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of The Interpretation (Definition of Native) Ordinance Cap 64 (Cap 64)</LINK>. The appellant then sought to challenge the status of Chua as a Native granted by the Native Court, before the Board of Officers (the Board) pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of Cap 64</LINK>. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> the Board is empowered to review the decision of the Native Court made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) of Cap 64</LINK>. The appellant's application was accordingly rejected by the Board.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The decision of the Board was made on 20 January 2012. The Board's decision was premised on the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of Cap 64</LINK>. In essence the Board was of the view that under that section, the application to appeal, review or to scrutinise Chua's Native Certificate was not opened to the appellant. It follows therefore that only ifChua, as the applicant for a declaration as a Native, had been aggrieved that he may do so under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> but not the appellant. In other words, only an applicant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1)</LINK> who is a party to the proceedings before the Native Court may make application to appeal, review or scrutinise the Native Certificate before the Board. The decision of the Board is found at pp 135-138 of vol 2 part C of the Appeal Records.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The appellant sought to obtain a redress against the decision of the Board by way of a judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (RHC)</LINK>. His application was made on 2 February 2012 as found of pp 37-38 of vol I part A of the Appeal Records. Though Chua was not cited as a party to the judicial review application, the same was served on him. At the stage where leave was considered, leave to submit before the court on the application for judicial review was granted to Chua's counsel. After hearing submissions by all parties, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review. The learned High Court Judge agreed that no error was committed by the Board in deciding that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> was not opened to the appellant. It was only opened to the applicant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1)</LINK>. The appellant appealed against the decision of the High Court, in the present appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In his application for judicial review before the High Court, the appellant states that the Board had acted unreasonably, irrationally and unlawfully in dismissing the application because the Board failed to consider the merits of the application listed in para 4(b) of his application. The full grounds cited in that paragraph are these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In my view, the grounds of application cited above are of no relevance to this appeal. There is no doubt the Board did not consider the merits of the appellant's application for review. This is because according to the Board, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> the appellant was not entitled to apply for a revision of the decision of the Native Court to the Board on a certificate issued to Chua.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> This appeal rests on one sole issue, that is, whether the decision of the Board to deny the appellant application to review the decision of the Native Court for the reason that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> does not permit appeal by any other person other than the applicant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1)</LINK>, was correct in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> What is before us in this appeal is therefore whether the Board had correctly construed <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of Cap 64</LINK> in denying the appellant the right under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of Cap 64</LINK>. In determining this issue it would fall squarely on the true construction of that section.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> It must be borne in mind that the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> must be construed in its plain and ordinary meaning and it must not be confused with the test of "adversely affected person" as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant. The word "adversely affected person" is not mentioned in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK> and cases on <i>locus standi</i> applying such test is therefore of no consequence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> I now come to the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of Cap 64</LINK>. In construing this provision, I agree with the approach taken by the learned High Court Judge following the cardinal rule of interpretation that a statute must first be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Unless the words give rise to a different meaning then a purposive approach would have to be adopted. I would also add that a statute must be read and construed as a whole and not to be taken in isolation. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_58;"><i>PP v. Tan Tatt Eek &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 685; [2005] 1 CLJ 713; [2005] 2 AMR 353, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_10;"><i>Megat Najmuddin Dato' Seri (Dr) Megat Khas v. Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 10</LINK>; [2002] 1 MLJ 385; [2002] 1 CLJ 645; [2002] 1 AMR 1089, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_407;"><i>Chin Choy &amp; Ors v.

KS Gill &amp; Co</i> [1946] 1 MLRA 41</LINK>; [1946] 1 MLJ 131 and <i>Magor and St Mellons RDC v. Newport Corporation</i> [1952] AC 189).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Upon my examination of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 of Cap 64</LINK>, I agree with the finding by the learned trial judge that s 3 was enacted with a sole objective of laying down the process or mechanism of how a person may apply to be declared a Native. Under s 3(1) the Native Court is empowered to declare a person to be a Native:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Section 3(2) confers exclusive jurisdiction to Native Court to entertain and determine an application made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(1) of Cap 64</LINK>, but it is subjected to s 3(3). Under s 3(3) the District Officer or the Board of Officers can review, scrutinise or determine an appeal on a declaration made under s 3(2). The language used in s 3 shows a process which enables a person to apply to be declared a Native, followed by section in s 3(2) which gives exclusive power to the Native Court to make that declaration subject to review, scrutiny or appeal under s 3(3). It flows from this provision that an applicant aggrieved by the decision of the Native Court under s 3(1) can invoke s 3(3) to lodge a complaint to the Board. It is axiomatic then that the person who could be aggrieved by the Native Court's decision made under s 3(2) must therefore be an applicant who may have been denied a declaration, or in some way aggrieved by the decision of the Native Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The scheme and structure of s 3 as a whole, in its plain and ordinary meaning and language cannot cause s 3(3) to be expanded to include any other person other than the applicant himself. The language of the provision it self reads "any declaration of any Native Court made in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by subsection (2) shall be subject to review and scrutiny by, and appeal to the District Officer or a Board of Officers appointed by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri for the purpose." The only person who can be aggrieved by the decision of the Native Court pursuant to s 3(1) would be the applicant. It is inconceivable to say that any other person would be aggrieved by the decision of the Native Court in the scheme of s 3. Thus a third person like the appellant here cannot invoke s 3(3) simply because the decision under s 3(2) does not affect him in any way whatsoever. He is a stranger to the application for declaration by Chua.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> For illustration this provision can be compared with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order53;SN4.;;">O 53 r 4 Rules of Court 2012</LINK>, which states that "Any person who is adversely affected by the decision of any public authority shall be entitled to make application." In determining the adversely "affected person" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK>, there are ample case authorities that had decided on how a person can be adversely affected (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_2_1;"><i>Malaysian Trade Union Congress &amp; Ors v. Menteri Tenaga, Air &amp; Komunikasi &amp; Anor</i> [2014] 2 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 145; [2014] 2 CLJ 525; [2014] 2 AMR 101 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_197;"><i>Ahli-Ahli Suruhanjaya Yang Membentuk Suruhanjaya Siasatan Mengenai Rakaman Klip Video Yang Mengandungi Imej Seorang Yang Dikatakan Peguambela Dan Peguamcara Berbual Melalui Telefon Mengenai Urusan Pelantikan Hakim-Hakim v. Tun Dato' Seri Ahmad Fairuz &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 197</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 490; [2012] 1 CLJ 805). Whereas s 3(3) is sequential to s 3(1) and s 3(2). It is not a provision that stands by itself but it is inextricably linked with one and the other and therefore must be read in context with the other subsections of s 3 (see <i>Shim Tshun Fatt v. PP</i> [2000] 3 MLRH 511 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_437;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 437</LINK>; [2014] 1 CLJ 289; [2014] 1 AMR 9).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Thus, reading the provisions in context and as a whole, there is no room for a third person to lodge an appeal under s 3(3) against the decision made by the Native Court. That right is only opened to the applicant before the Native Court under s 3(1) which surely would have been Chua in the context of the present appeal. The court cannot read into this provision by adding into it, any other person than the applicant. This, the court cannot add, when the legislator does not intend to add. I agree with the learned High Court Judge that if the legislator intended so, it could easily put the words "subject to appeal for review by a party apart from the person claiming to be a native for native status or some similar words to that effect". It is not for the court to read into the law what is not intended by the legislature. I am guided by the decision of the Supreme Court through the judgment of the late George Seah SCJ in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_609;"><i>NKM Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Pan Malaysia Wood Bhd</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 609</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 39, who reiterated in that case that, the constitutional function of the court is to interpret the law and to enforce it. Further he said, "The duty of the court and its only duty is to expound the language of the Act in accordance with settled rules of construction. The court has nothing to do with the policy of the Act which it may be called upon to interpret." Guided by these principles, I am of the view that s 3(3) is clear in its meaning and the only way to interpret s 3(3) is to say that the right to review under that section refers only to the applicant under s 3(1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Though in general, the option available to any person who claims to have been "adversely affected" by a decision of a public authority is by way of judicial review, we are not here to deliberate on whether the appellant has such right. We are here to deliberate on the locus of the appellant or the right of the appellant to invoke s 3(3) in applying for a review of a the decision of the Native Court in issuing the Native Certificate to Chua, to the Board. It is also for this reason that I am of the view that the test of "adversely affected person" to determine locus for a judicial review does not apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Besides, the appellant himself was aware of numerous decisions that declaration by the Native Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3 Cap 64</LINK> is conclusive unless reviewed or appealed upon under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3)</LINK>. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_504;"><i>Datuk Syed Kechik Bin Syed Mohamed v. Government Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 504</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 101, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_396;"><i>Joseph Paulus Lantip v. Lian Kee Chu &amp; Ors</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 396</LINK>). However, in this judicial review application the appellant is not applying for a review of the Native Court's decision in issuing the Native Certificate to Chua. The appellant instead is appealing against the decision of the Board to reject his application to review the decision of the Native Court in issuing the certificate to Chua.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Even for a moment, if it can be argued that an "adversely affected" test may be read into s 3(3), the appellant has not demonstrated how he was affected especially when he and the 97 other plaintiffs in the suit S21-622009 had their ownerships to their land already restored by the High Court of Sandakan on 23 December 2011. In this regard, I completely agree with the learned High Court Judge that the status of Chua is no longer a life issue and is merely academic.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> For the above reasons, I am of the view that the Board or the 1st respondent had correctly interpreted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1952_064;3.;;">s 3(3) of Cap 64</LINK>. The decision of the Board is therefore not irrational or suffers from <i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness. There is no good reason for the decision of the Board to be impugned and hence I would dismiss the appeal of the appellant and uphold the decision of the learned trial judge.</p>
