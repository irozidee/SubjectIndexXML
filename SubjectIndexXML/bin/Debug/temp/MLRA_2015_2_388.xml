    <p>The appellant was charged with trafficking in methamphetamine, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act")</LINK>. The prosecution's case was that at the material time, a police party led by SP6 raided a room in a house where the appellant was sleeping. SP6 woke up the appellant, identified himself as a police officer and administered the caution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1)(b) of the Act ("exh P14")</LINK>. SP6 then asked the appellant whether the appellant kept any illegal substance, and the appellant answered that he had, and subsequently climbed a shoe rack and from the top of the cupboard, the appellant took a plastic packet containing crystal-like substances, which were later confirmed by the chemist ("SP4") to be methamphetamine ("the drugs"). At the end of the prosecution's case, the trial judge found that the appellant had possession of the drugs and having invoked the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>, the trial judge called upon the appellant to enter his defence. The appellant, in his defence, disputed SP6's version of events leading to the recovery of the drugs. The appellant contended that the drugs were recovered as a result of a search of the room by the police. The appellant further stated that the drugs belonged to one Mohd Fadli Sham ("SP7"). According to the appellant, SP7 had come to his room and wanted to keep something in the appellant's room. After his arrest, the appellant informed SP6 about SP7 and led the police to SP7's house. SP7 was subsequently arrested by the police. At the end of the defence case, the trial judge reduced the charge to one of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2) of the Act</LINK>, and sentenced the appellant accordingly. Aggrieved, the appellant appealed against the conviction and sentence, while the prosecution appealed against the reduction of the charge. In the present appeals, the appellant submitted, amongst others, that the trial judge misdirected himself when he acted on exh P14, which was inadmissible as there was no oral evidence given by SP6 of the statutory caution that was administered; that the act of the appellant in climbing the shoe rack and taking the plastic packet amounted to a statement and as such was also inadmissible; that there was violation of a right to fair trial as the trial judge's reliance on exh P14 and its contents, his invocation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950 ("s 27 EA")</LINK> based on the appellant's statement and his reliance on the conduct of the appellant were highly prejudicial to the appellant; and that the appellant was entitled to an acquittal, as the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> had been rebutted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal and dismissing the prosecution's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant appeal, SP6 did not state in his evidence the caution that was administered on the appellant. What SP6 did was to testify that he prepared a note every time he conducted a raid. In light of the evidence of SP6, the statutory caution was not properly administered by SP6 and if administered was not understood by the appellant. Based on the principles in <i>Francis Antonysamy v. PP</i>, exh P14 was inadmissible as there was no oral evidence of SP6 on the statutory caution administered to the appellant as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1) of the Act</LINK>. Since exh P14 was inadmissible, it followed that the contents thereof could not be relied upon. (<i>Francis Antonysamy v. PP (folld)</i>). (paras 20-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The appellant's answers given to SP6 were confessions and apart from the alleged confessions by the appellant, there was no other information provided by the appellant that lead the police to the discovery of the drugs. Hence, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 EA</LINK> was not applicable. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The version of SP6 that the drugs were taken by the appellant from the top of the cupboard after the appellant had confessed to keeping it was challenged by the defence. It was the defence version that the drugs were recovered as a result of the search by the police. This was an important aspect of the defence but nowhere did the trial judge address this aspect of the defence. This failure amounted to a misdirection and had occasioned a failure of justice to the appellant which rendered reliance on the conduct of the appellant unsafe. (<i>Lim Pah Soon v. PP (refd)</i>). (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Regarding the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>, the presumption cannot be said to have been rebutted without sufficient evidence, namely evidence which was reasonably sufficient to invite belief in its probable truthfulness. In this instance, there was sufficient evidence from SP7 who had admitted going to the appellant's house. In the light of the evidence of SP7, the issue of whether it was SP7 who had kept the drugs in the appellant's room was left at large, and the defence of the appellant that the drugs were placed by SP7 was credible, probable and logical and had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. (<i>Attan Bin Abdul Gani v. PP (refd)</i>; <i>PP v. Teh Eng Wah (refd)</i>). (paras 30-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The reasonable conclusion from the evidence of SP6 was that the arrest of SP7 was pursuant to the appellant's information that SP7 came to his room and had kept the drugs there. In fact, the trial judge had made an affirmative finding on the role of SP7. Yet, the trial judge found that the appellant had control and knowledge of the drugs on the premise that the appellant knew SP7 was a drug addict and the appellant knew that SP7 had access to the house and to the appellant's room. Here, the trial judge erred in his premise in finding possession against the appellant. (paras 33-35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The conviction of the appellant on possession was not safe. If the drugs belonged to and were kept by SP7, the appellant had no power to deal with and to dispose of the drugs. Absent the physical element of possession, the conviction of the appellant for the offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2) of the Act</LINK> was not sustainable.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Mohd Fakri Mohd Rozali (the appellant) was charged in the High Court at Kota Bharu for trafficking in 156.02 grams of methamphetamine, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the end of the defence case, the learned trial judge relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_547;"><i>Balachandran v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 547</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 301; [2005] 1 CLJ 85; [2005] 1 AMR 321 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311 and reduced the charge to one of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2) of the Act</LINK>. The appellant was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest and 10 strokes of the rattan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Aggrieved by the above decision, both the appellant and the prosecution filed their respective appeals. Appeal No: D-05-9-01-2014 is the appellant's appeal against the conviction and sentence and Appeal No: D-05-10-01-2014 is the prosecution's appeal against the reduction of the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Briefly, the prosecution's case is as follows. On 3 August 2012, a police party led by SP6 raided an unnumbered house at Jalan Pasir Hor, Kampung Padang Enggang, Kota Bharu. He went to the room where the appellant was sleeping. SP6 woke up the appellant, identified himself as a police officer and administered the caution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1)(b) of the Act</LINK>. SP6 asked the appellant whether the appellant kept any illegal substance. The appellant confessed that he kept some 'ais'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> When SP6 asked the appellant where it was, the appellant then climbed the shoe rack and from the top of the cupboard, the appellant took a plastic packet containing crystal like substances which were later confirmed by the chemist (SP4) to be methamphetamine, the subject matter of the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case the learned trial judge made the following findings (Rekod Rayuan: ms 143):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Having found that the appellant had possession of the drugs and having invoked the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> by virtue of the weight of the methamphetamine, the learned trial judge called upon the appellant to enter his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In his evidence given under oath, the appellant disputed the version of SP6 as regards the recovery of the drugs. His version was that the drugs were recovered as a result of a search of the room. The appellant further stated that the drugs belonged to Mohd Fadli Sham also known as Pok San (SP7). According to the appellant, on 3 August 2012, SP7 came to his room where SP7 had told the appellant that he wanted to keep something in the appellant's room. After his arrest, the appellant informed SP6 about SP7 and led the police to SP7's house. SP7 was subsequently arrested by the police.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At the end of the whole case, the learned trial judge said (Rekod Rayuan: ms 155):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We heard both the appeals together at the end of which we had allowed the appeal by the appellant and dismissed the appeal by the prosecution. We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant canvassed the following grounds of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On the first ground, the complaint of learned counsel for the appellant was that in relying on exh P14 to find a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking and ultimately to convict the appellant for the offence of possession, the learned trial judge had failed to address the question of admissibility of exh P14.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was submitted by learned counsel that P14 was inadmissible as there was no oral evidence given by SP6 of the statutory caution that was administered by SP6 on the appellant. Further, the act of the appellant in climbing the shoe rack and taking the plastic packet, submitted learned counsel, amounts to a statement and as such was also inadmissible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The second issue canvassed by learned counsel was taken as point of law. It was the submission of learned counsel that an accused person is entitled to a fair trial and as decided by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_286;"><i>Lee Kwan Woh v. PP</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 286</LINK>; [2009] 5 MLJ 301; [2009] 5 CLJ 631, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> guarantees that right.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In the instant appeal, it was submitted that the reliance by the learned trial judge on exh P14 and on the contents and the invocation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> and thereafter acted on the conduct of the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;8.;;">s 8</LINK>, represented an "overkill" and was highly prejudicial to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On the third ground, it was submitted that by reason of the finding that the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> had been rebutted, the learned trial judge ought to have acquitted the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In appealing against the reduction of the charge from trafficking to one of possession, learned deputy submitted that exh P14 was correctly admitted as caution was administered by SP6. Learned deputy contended that exh P14 was only corroborative evidence and that the learned trial judge did not rely on exh P14 in finding a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Relying on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_682;"><i>Mohd Zaiham Mislan v. PP</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 682</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 737; [2010] 1 CLJ 1, learned deputy argued that the conduct of the appellant in climbing on the shoe rack to take the drugs on top of the cupboard is admissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A of the Act</LINK> without the need for the prosecution to show that caution had been administered. Such conduct of the appellant, submitted learned deputy, was correctly considered by the learned trial judge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;8.;;">s 8</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Finally learned deputy submitted that the learned trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had rebutted the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> as the denial by the appellant without any other evidence was not capable of rebutting the presumption on the balance of probability.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In support of the argument that exh P14 was inadmissible, learned counsel cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_230;"><i>Francis Antonysamy v. PP</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 230</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 389; [2005] 2 CLJ 481; [2003] 2 AMR 455 where the Federal Court said at p 233:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> As in <i>Francis Antonysamy (supra)</i>, in the instant appeal, SP6 did not state in his evidence the caution that was administered on the appellant. What SP6 did was to testify that he prepared a note every time he conducted a raid. His evidence was as follows (Rekod Rayuan: ms 37):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> At p 49:Rekod Rayuan:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In the light of the above evidence of SP6, we were not satisfied that statutory caution was properly administered by SP6 and if administered was understood by the appellant. Learned deputy offered no submission on why we ought not to follow <i>Francis Antonysamy</i>, a decision of the Federal Court, though learned deputy cited <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_682;"><i>Mohd Zaiham Mislan v. PP</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 682</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 737; [2010] 1 CLJ 1, another Federal Court decision. In <i>Mohd Zaiham (supra)</i> the Federal Court through Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin FCJ (as His Lordship then was) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We noted that in the case of <i>Mohd Zaiham (supra)</i>, caution was in fact administered and explained to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Based on the principles in <i>Francis Antonysamy (supra)</i> we found merits in the submission by learned counsel for the appellant that exh P14 was inadmissible as there was no oral evidence of SP6 on the statutory caution administered to the appellant as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1) of the Act</LINK>. Since exh P14 was inadmissible, it follows that the contents thereof could not be relied upon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> From the judgment of the learned trial judge, it was apparent that apart from exh P14, the learned trial judge relied on the following evidence to find a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Learned counsel's grievance, which formed the second ground of appeal, was on the following approach of the learned trial judge which was contended to be highly prejudicial to the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another complaint was that the answers given by the appellant, namely "Ya, saya punya" and "saya punya" were clear confessions which learned counsel contended, on the authority of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_239;"><i>Krishnan Ramar v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 239</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 292; [1987] CLJ (Rep) 145, that they do not lead to discovery of the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We agreed with learned counsel that the answers "Ya, saya punya" and "saya punya" were confessions and that apart from the alleged confessions by the appellant, there was no other information provided by the appellant such as to lead the police to the discovery of the drugs. On the facts, it was our view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK> was not applicable in the instant case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> As for the reliance of conduct under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;8.;;">s 8 of the Evidence Act</LINK>, it has been emphasised by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_181;"><i>Ibrahim Mohamad &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 181</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 387; [2011] 4 CLJ 113 that evidence of conduct must not be considered in isolation but together with other aspects of the case. Further, an inference of knowledge many be drawn from proved facts (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717). We noted that the version of SP6 that the drugs were taken by the appellant from the top of the cupboard after the appellant had confessed to keeping it was challenged by the defence. It was the defence version that the drugs were recovered as a result of the search by the police. This was an important aspect of the defence but nowhere did the learned trial judge address this aspect of the defence. This failure in our judgment, amounts to a misdirection and had occasioned a failure to justice to the appellant (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2013_168;"><i>Lim Pah Soon v. PP</i> [2013] MLRAU 168</LINK>; [2013] 6 MLJ 252; [2013] 8 CLJ 800) which renders reliance on the conduct of the appellant unsafe.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As regards the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>, we agreed with the submission of learned deputy that the presumption cannot be said to have been rebutted without sufficient evidence, namely evidence which is reasonably sufficient to invite belief in its probable truthfulness (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1969_1_58;"><i>Attan Bin Abdul Gani v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1969] 1 MLRH 58</LINK>; [1970] 2 MLJ 143b). In the instant appeal, we found that there is sufficient evidence from none other than Pok San himself (SP7) who had admitted going to the appellant's house at 6am on 3 August 2012 (Rekod Rayuan: pp 61, 64).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Seen in the light of the evidence of SP7, it was our view that the issue whether it was SP7 who had kept the drugs in the room was left at large. We found that the defence of the appellant that the drugs were placed by SP7 was credible, probable and logical and had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1999_3_502;"><i>PP v. Teh Eng Wah</i> [1999] 3 MLRH 502</LINK>; [1999] 8 CLJ 451).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The appellant's version that he had informed the police about SP7 was supported by the following evidence of SP6 (pp 43-44:Rekod Rayuan):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> If, as contended by the prosecution that the appellant had confessed that the drugs were his and his alone, there was no necessity for the appellant to provide a name to SP6. The reasonable conclusion from the evidence of SP6 was that the arrest of SP7 was pursuant to the appellant's information that SP7 came to his room and had kept the drugs there. In fact the learned trial judge had made an affirmative finding on the role of SP7 as follows (p 155: Rekod Rayuan):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Notwithstanding the learned trial judge's affirmative finding on the role of SP7 as regards the drugs found in the appellant's room, His Lordship found (p 155: Rekod Rayuan):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> From the above, the learned trial judge found that the appellant had control and knowledge of the drugs on the premise, that the appellant knew SP7 was a drug addict and the appellant knew that SP7 had access to the house and to the appellant's room. The learned trial judge, in our view erred in his premise in finding possession against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Given the defence which we found to be not inherently improbable, and given the evidence of SP7, we were of the view that the conviction of the appellant on possession is not safe. If the drugs belonged to and were kept by SP7, the appellant had no power to deal with and to dispose the drugs. Absent the physical element of possession, we found that the conviction of the appellant for the offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2)</LINK> is not sustainable. We therefore unanimously allowed the appeal of the appellant. The conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court was set aside. The appellant was acquitted and discharged. The appeal by the prosecution was dismissed.</p>
