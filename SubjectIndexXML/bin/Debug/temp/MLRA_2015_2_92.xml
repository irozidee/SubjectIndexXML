      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant's appeal arose from the High Court's decision to set aside ten paragraphs and vary two paragraphs in an arbitration award following the respondent's application made to the court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">ss 37(1)(a)(iv), (2)(b), (3)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">42 of the Arbitration Act 2005 ('the Act')</LINK>. The award stemmed from a dispute pertaining to the respondent's "extra over" claim for payment for piling works done in a design-and-build construction contract wherein the respondent was the main contractor and the appellant was the employer. The claim was made as the respondent had to bore through hard rock in the course of piling works resulting in a variation of the design required by the appellant. At the outset, the arbitrator formulated four issues for the parties' consideration, namely: (i) what was "hard rock" for the purposes of the contract; (ii) whether hard rock was encountered during the piling works; (iii) if yes, whether extra-over payment was due for boring through hard rock?; (iv) if yes, at what rate. All parties agreed with the formulated issues. However, after the close of submissions by the parties, the arbitrator requested them to submit further written submissions and clarifications on the length of hard rock that was bored. The arbitrator then, having found that the respondent was entitled to its claim, nevertheless went on to dismiss it on the ground that the quantum of hard rock that was bored during the piling works was not proved. In the High Court, the learned judge found that the conclusion on quantum by the arbitrator was flawed on the ground that the arbitrator had decided on a "new difference", ie the matter of length or quantity of hard rock, which was not an issue of concern between the contracting parties and irrelevant to the issue of entitlement to the extra over claims, there being no dispute on that issue. The learned judge then proceeded to set aside and vary the relevant paragraphs to allow the respondent's claim up to the amount of RM3,300,727 with costs of the arbitration. Hence, the appeal by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Due recognition was given to the principles of finality of awards, party autonomy and minimal court intervention in the context of the Model Law legal regime, and the more general considerations that the courts should be arbitration-friendly and pro-enforcement. However, an award should not be allowed to stand in the face of a clear excess of jurisdiction and a breach of the equally important principle that the arbitration proceeding was consensual and the mandate of the chosen arbitrator was limited to the terms of the submissions and agreed issues. If four issues had been agreed, the arbitrator could not, on his own volition, add another issue (particularly without prior consensus and after the close of the case of the parties), as that would result in gross unfairness. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> On the facts of the case, the respondent had lost its opportunity to introduce evidence through witnesses to establish the length and quantity of hard rock bored, or to prove by evidence that it would be commercially impractical to do so. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The learned judge chose not to proceed further to consider the issue of breach of natural justice rules and the issue of conflict with "public policy", choosing instead to rely wholly on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(a)(iv) of the Act</LINK> since the setting aside argument was not premised on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(b)</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">Section 37(2)</LINK> only came into play when "conflict with public policy of Malaysia" was made a ground under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(b)</LINK>. Therefore, the appeal herein did not need to address the issue of conflict with the public policy of Malaysia. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was no reason to interfere with the decision of the learned judge on the setting aside of the ten paragraphs. The facts showed that the learned arbitrator had introduced a "new difference" irrelevant to the issues as submitted and agreed between the parties. A breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(a)(iv) of the Act</LINK> could be the basis of a setting aside of the whole or part of an award though it did not permit the court to vary an award. (paras 40-41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The power to effect a variation was only available under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> which the learned judge rightfully formed the basis to vary paras 152 and 153 of the award. However, with the insertion of subsection (1A) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>, the court was cautioned against setting aside or varying an award unless the error of law substantially affected the rights of parties. The issue of what constituted a question of law was helpfully addressed by Nallini Pathmanathan J in <i>Exceljade Sdn Bhd v. Bauer (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.</i> (paras 41, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 &amp; 59)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The learned judge allowed only two out of the six questions of law referred to the High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>, namely Questions (v) and (vi). Questions (i) to (iv) were essentially questions of facts "dressed up" as questions of law. Hence, the learned judge was right in dismissing them. The same could not be said as regards questions (v) and (vi). (para 61)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A. Subject Matter And The Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The subject matter of this appeal is an arbitration award which was challenged by the present respondent, Perwira Bintang Holdings Sdn Bhd, in the High Court on the basis of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(a)(iv), 37(2)(b) and 37(3) of the Arbitration Act 2005 ("the Act")</LINK> to set aside identified paragraphs in the Final Award dated 24 October 2012 ("the Award"). Altogether, the application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37 of the Act</LINK> was to set aside ten paragraphs in the Award. These paragraphs are paras 117, 118, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 139 and 140. As a further and alternative prayer, Perwira Bintang Holdings Sdn Bhd also applied to set aside or vary in part, or in whole, the Award under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The arbitration concerned a domestic arbitration in relation to a claim for "extra over" payment for piling work through "hard rock" in a design-and-build construction contract where Perwira Bintang Holdings was the main contractor, and the Government of Malaysia the owner/employer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Perwira Bintang Holdings Sdn Bhd was the claimant in the arbitration proceeding, and the plaintiff in the High Court action to set aside or vary the Award. Hence, the present appellant, the Government of Malaysia, was the respondent in the arbitration and the defendant in the High Court action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The sole arbitrator in fact found for the present respondent on the issue of liability, but dismissed its claim since it had not proven the quantum of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> For clarity, we will refer to the parties by name, namely the Government of Malaysia ("Government") as the appellant and Perwira Bintang Holdings Sdn Bhd ("Perwira Bintang") as the respondent in this appeal. The respective positions of the parties are thus as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>B. Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The High Court, for reasons to be stated later in this judgment, allowed Perwira Bintang's application and struck out the earlier mentioned paragraphs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37</LINK> and two other paragraphs (paras 152 and 153) under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>. Being dissatisfied with the High Court's decision, the Government brings this appeal. The Memorandum of Appeal rests on the basic grounds that the learned High Court Judge had erred as a whole, in law and on the facts, in allowing Perwira Bintang's application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>. More specifically, the learned judge is said to have erred in law and in fact when setting aside paras 117, 118, 120 to 125, 139 and 140 of the Award when deciding to vary para 152 of the Award to allow Perwira Bintang's claim for RM3,300,727.00, and when deciding to vary para 153 of the Award (which related to costs of the arbitration).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It will be seen, therefore, that the application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37</LINK> was to set aside part of the Award, whereas the application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> was to vary two paragraphs of the Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C. The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">Section 37</LINK> Argument</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Under the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37</LINK> application, the argument centred on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(a)(iv)</LINK> on the basis that the arbitrator had decided on an award which dealt with a "dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration." This is clearly a "jurisdiction" argument. Perwira Bintang also argued on the basis of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(2)(b)</LINK>, a procedural point on a breach of the rules of natural justice, and a point, as we understand it, which flowed from the basic jurisdiction point. The third ground under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37</LINK> related to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(3)</LINK>, which is another procedural issue to allow the separation of the offending parts of the Award from the unobjectionable parts so as to allow the setting aside of these offending parts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>D. The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">Section 42</LINK> Argument</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As for the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> argument, this aspect of the case concerned a "reference on questions of law" said to "arise from the award". Six questions of law were raised. The learned judge decided on only two, and, as already alluded to, varied the two paragraphs, namely paras 152 and 153 of the Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>E. The Underlying Policy Considerations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Underlying these detailed legal arguments is the important issue of the extent to which courts should interfere with an arbitration award in the context of the Act which has made it clear in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;8.;;">s 8</LINK> (as amended) that no court shall intervene in matters governed by the Act "except where so provided in [the] Act." The policy to be adopted by our courts is that of minimal intervention consistent with the policy underlying the UNCITRAL Model Law, which Malaysia has incorporated with suitable amendments. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">Section 37</LINK> mirrors the Model Law (art 34). However, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> has no direct equivalent provision in the Model Law. Nevertheless, this court has to carefully consider whether we should strictly construe and adhere to the principles of party autonomy, finality of arbitration awards and minimal court intervention rigidly on the facts of this appeal, even though in the context of a domestic arbitration. We have kept these issues uppermost in mind, since the grounds advanced by Perwira Bintang and addressed by the learned judge in the High Court, have brought these issues to the fore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Suffice for us to refer to our Federal Court judgment in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_214;"><i>The Government Of India v. Cairn Energy India Pty Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 214</LINK>; [2012] 3 CLJ 423 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_383;"><i>Ajwa For Food Industries Co (MIGOP), Egypt v. Pacific Inter-Link Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 383</LINK>; [2013] 2 CLJ 395 as authorities in point.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In <i>The Government Of India v. Cairn Energy India Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, Richard Malanjum CJ (Sabah &amp; Sarawak) held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In <i>Ajwa For Food Industries Co (MIGOP)</i>, <i>Egypt v. Pacific Inter-Link Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal (supra)</i>, Ramly Ali JCA (now FCJ) stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We will address these general issues at appropriate stages in this judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>F. The Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Turning now to the background facts, Perwira Bintang succeeded in its claim to establish liability for the payment of the "extra over" claim, but failed in establishing quantum such that the arbitrator dismissed its claim. In the originating summons action, the learned judge set aside the paragraphs earlier mentioned and varied the award to allow Perwira Bintang's claim up to the amount of RM3,300,727.00 with costs of the arbitration in its favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The contract in question was for a contract sum of RM320 Million. It was a design-and-build negotiated contract for the construction of an Office Tower Block in Bukit Aman for the project described as "Cadangan Pembinaan Kompleks KDN/KA &amp; Logistik, Bukit Aman". As noted earlier, the subject matter of the dispute between the parties was payment for piling works. The description and rates for the piling works were based on provisional bills of quantities. The rates were included in the "contract sum analysis" identified in the contract as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2</LINK>, Appendix 5 of Part 5. The rates for both preliminary piles and working piles were stated as:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The relevant document appears at pp 213-214 of the Appeal Record, vol II, Part C.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> For emphasis, we underscore the words "in all soils (excluding hard rock)".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Perwira Bintang had to bore through hard rock/material in the course of the piling works resulting from a variation in the design required by the Government. The changes made to the original piling works design were to suit "aspects of suitability, functionality and safety pursuant to directions from Cawangan Pakar dan Kejuruteraan Awam" of JKR. (See para 72.5.2 of the Award)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It is not in dispute that Perwira Bintang had to bore through hard rock/ material, and on the pleadings, the Government did not dispute the presence of hard rock. While Perwira Bintang and the Government both agreed that there was no express rate stated for boring through hard rock, each party took completely different positions. Perwira Bintang argued it was entitled to be paid at market rate for the piling through hard rock. The Government, on the other hand, disclaimed liability by resorting to cls 27.3 and 27.4 of the contract under which allegedly any extra costs occasioned by any variation to the piling design had to be borne by Perwira Bintang itself. The expert opinions adduced in the arbitration proceeding confirmed the presence of hard rock, being rock with "uniaxial compressive strength values in excess of 50 MPa". There was agreement too on the rate for boring through hard rock, namely RM1,091.00 per metre for 600mm diameter bored pile and RM2,929.00 per metre for 1500 mm diameter bored pile.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The general length of the piling through hard rock was available from the piling records, and this formed the basis of Perwira Bintang's claim for the extra over payment, namely 1,077 m of bored length in respect of 1500 mm piles and 134 m of bored length for 600 mm piles. However, the exact length of the hard rock encountered was not established. On this basis, the arbitrator, having found in favour of Perwira Bintang on liability, nevertheless dismissed the claim on quantum.</p>

      <b>G. Finding Of "New Difference" By The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The learned High Court Judge considered the background facts in some detail. Her Ladyship also evaluated the issues formulated by the arbitrator, as agreed and modified by both parties. Her Ladyship considered the detailed finding of the arbitrator, which was quoted <i>in extenso</i>, but concluded that the arbitrator had decided on a dispute which was not contemplated by, or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration. This is an area of arbitration law which allows the court to set aside an award on the ground that an arbitrator had decided on a "new difference" which is irrelevant to the claim, the "new difference" being understood as a new dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the arbitration submission. The underlying rationale for this rule rests on the consensual nature of arbitration. Parties are not compelled to resort to arbitration contractually, but if they provide for it and refer their dispute to arbitration, the mandate of the arbitrator must be limited to the terms defined by the parties for him to exercise his jurisdiction. If the arbitrator strays from the confines of this mandate, he will be acting in excess of his jurisdiction, even though he may have the initial and primary jurisdiction to arbitrate between the parties. This rationale is stated succinctly by the Court of Appeal, Singapore in <i>PT Prima International Development v. Kempinski Hotel SA &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2012] SGCA 35:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> This case was cited by Her Ladyship, together with several other decisions of the Singapore courts, such as <i>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v. Dexia Bank SA</i> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597, <i>CRW Joint Operation v. PT Perusahaan Gas Negara</i> [2011] 4 SLR 305 and <i>Sui Southern Gas Co Ltd v. Habibullah Coastal Power Co (Pte) Ltd</i> [2010] 3 SLR 1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> These persuasive cases, and others, that have been addressed by our courts lay down one basic principle - an arbitrator must decide the dispute according to the scope of the arbitration and he cannot decide the dispute on issues that have not been raised or addressed by the parties. This basic principle arose in the High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2013_3_9;"><i>Government Of The Lao People's Democratic Republic v.

    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We now turn to consider whether on the facts and circumstances of this present appeal, there was a "new difference" introduced and decided by the arbitrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We start with considering the issues that were before the arbitrator. At the outset, the arbitrator had formulated four issues for the parties' consideration, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Perwira Bintang as the claimant agreed with these formulated issues. The Government restated the issues to read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> To quote the pertinent parts of the Award:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Thus, it was acknowledged there were five related issues. The Rock Boring Rate was agreed between the parties. The Government disputed whether "hard rock" was encountered by an amendment to its pleaded defence, and an attempt to draw a distinction between hard rock and rock. Further, the Government took the position that the contract did not allow for extra-over payment in any event. The Government paid for the length of the piling but at the "all soils" rate. The pertinent amendments to the defence read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> After the close of the submissions by the parties, the arbitrator had requested both parties to submit further written submissions and clarification. This part of the proceeding is noted in the Award in paras 57 and 58, which we quote below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The further written submissions of the parties appear from pp 473 to 495 of the Appeal Record, Part C, vol III. Perwira Bintang argued that the Government must remain bound by its pleaded case and not resile from its position that Perwira Bintang had bored through hard rock. Perwira Bintang raised the issues of estoppel and the principle that the arbitrator should not attempt to improve the pleaded case of the Government. As for evidence of the length and quantity of rocks with qu values in excess of 50 MPa, Perwira did allude to the argument that it would have been "practically impossible" to do so. See paras (39) to (41) of Perwira Bintang's submission appearing at p 487 of the Appeal Record, Part C, vol III:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The arbitrator dealt with the evidence, the law and the respective submissions of the parties in considerable detail. In his "Summary of Findings", the arbitrator stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The learned judge, as we have seen earlier, treated this conclusion on quantum by the arbitrator as flawed since the arbitrator had decided on a "new difference", as the term is understood in the cases. Her Ladyship found the arbitrator's conclusion as "almost perverse" and "requires the intervention of this court." Her Ladyship held that it was "quite apparent" that the Award "involved a new difference or such matters which would have been irrelevant to the issues requiring determination", stating that the "new difference" was "the matter of length or quantity of hard rock which was irrelevant to the issue of entitlement to the extra over claims because there was no dispute on this as seen from the documentation and conduct of the parties." Her Ladyship also noted that the Government made no reference to the issue of proof of the length or quantity of hard rock in its submissions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Her Ladyship stated at paras [86] to [90] of her judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>H. The Findings Of This Court On <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;7.;;">Section 37</LINK> And The Policy Considerations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We have considered the Appeal Record, in particular the reasoning and findings of the arbitrator. Inasmuch as our courts must embrace the principles of finality of awards, party autonomy and minimal court intervention in the context of the Model Law legal regime, and the more general considerations that our courts should be arbitration-friendly and pro-enforcement, we cannot allow an award to stand in the face of a clear excess of jurisdiction and a breach of the equally important principle that arbitration proceeding is consensual and the mandate of the chosen arbitrator has to be limited to the terms of the submissions and the agreed issues. If four issues have been agreed, the arbitrator cannot, on his own volition, add another issue (particularly without prior consensus and after the close of the case of the parties), for to allow this will result in gross unfairness. On the facts of this case, Perwira Bintang had lost its opportunity to introduce evidence through witnesses, if need be, to establish the length and quantity of hard rock bored, or even to prove by evidence that it would be commercially impractical to do so. Her Ladyship chose not to proceed further to consider the issue of breach of natural justice rules and the issue of conflict with "public policy", choosing instead to relying wholly on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(a)(iv) of the Act</LINK>. The reluctance to proceed further is warranted, since the setting aside argument is not premised on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(b)</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">Section 37(2)</LINK> comes into play only when "conflict with public policy of Malaysia" is made a ground under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(b)</LINK>. Thus, we too are of the view that this appeal does not need to address the issue of conflict with the public policy of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Hence, on the setting aside of the ten paragraphs, we see no reason to interfere with the decision of the learned judge below. We agree that on the facts of this appeal, the learned arbitrator had introduced a "new difference" which was irrelevant to the issues as submitted and agreed between the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> As noted earlier, a breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37(1)(a)(iv) of the Act</LINK> can be the basis of a setting aside of the whole or part of an award, but it cannot permit the court to vary an award. The power to effect a variation, however, is available under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>. It was on this basis that the learned judge varied paras [152] and [153] of the Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>I. The Detailed Arguments On <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">Section 42</LINK>: Reference On Questions Of Law</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We now address the arguments on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>, which concerns a reference on a question or questions of law arising from an award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Decision On The Reference On Questions Of Law Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">Section 42 Of The Act</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Unlike the evaluation and analysis of the dispute under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37 of the Act</LINK>, the learned judge devoted only six paragraphs of the comprehensive judgment to that aspect concerning <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>. There were altogether six questions of law posed to the court, but Her Ladyship was persuaded by only two of these, namely Questions of Law (v) and (vi).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The stand taken by the appellant is that all six questions of law are essentially questions of fact "dressed up" as questions of law, and therefore cannot fall within the ambit and purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">Section 42(1)</LINK> provides that any party "may apply to the High Court to determine any question of law arising out of an award." An amendment in 2011 has included subsection (1A) which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Developing Case Law</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We have considered the several cases, which have been decided by our courts on the approach to be taken, and the meaning to be ascribed to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>. Both parties have referred to an earlier decision of the High Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_14_331;"><i>Majlis Amanah Rakyat v. Kausar Corporation Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 14 MLRH 331</LINK> (over which I presided). I then had occasion to offer the following view:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In the subsequent case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_3_948;"><i>Maimunah Deraman v. Majlis Perbandaran Kemaman</i> [2010] 3 MLRH 948</LINK>; [2011] 9 CLJ 689, parties had agreed that the same jurisprudence should apply. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2013_5_370;"><i>Lembaga Kemajuan Ikan Malaysia v. WJ Construction Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] 5 MLRH 370</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 98; [2013] 8 CLJ 655, a similar sentiment was echoed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In this appeal too, counsel for the respondent agrees likewise. Counsel for the appellant, however, has also referred to the more recent decision of the High Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2013_986;"><i>Exceljade Sdn Bhd v. Bauer (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] MLRHU 986</LINK>; [2014] 1 AMR 253, where a less limited view of the provision has been proffered. Nallini Pathmanathan J (now JCA) was of the view that the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;24.;;">s 24 of the Arbitration Act 1952</LINK> (the "error of law on the face of the award" test) should not be extended to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the present Act</LINK>. Nallini Pathmanathan J held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The views expressed in <i>Exceljade (supra)</i>, clearly differs from the earlier view expressed in <i>Majlis Amanah Rakyat v. Kausar Corporation Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, where I had expressed the view that the governing principles on error of law on the face of the award was "too well entrenched in our law to be simply discarded as an accident of legislation." Counsel for the respondent has expressly referred to this passage and agreed with it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> As indicated earlier, <i>Majlis Amanah Rakyat v. Kausar Corporation Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, was the first case argued and reported on the new <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>, prompting me to also add the following passage in the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Since this case was decided, Parliament has inserted subsection (1A) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>, such that as a matter of statutory interpretation, the court is now cautioned against setting aside or varying an award unless the error of law substantially affects the rights of parties. It would thus appear this particular jurisdiction is not to be lightly exercised by the courts, as indicated by the very terms of the provision:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The statutory wording mandates the court to dismiss ("shall dismiss") the reference on the question of law unless the question of law affects in a substantial way the rights of the party or parties. Additionally, the court may require the arbitral tribunal to provide the reasons for its award if the award does not contain the reasons, or contain reasons that are not in sufficient detail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Effect Of <i>Exceljade</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> With the amendment, and reading the provision in its overall context, the views expressed in <i>Exceljade (supra)</i>, should perhaps now be preferred. However, on the special facts of a particular appeal, the previous jurisprudence and the new law may just overlap. This is the position taken by the appellant. Counsel for the appellant submits:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Nevertheless, the <i>Exceljade</i> approach will align our law with that of other jurisdictions where the old jurisprudence on "error of law on the face of the award" has been rejected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Our Act, being closely modelled on the New Zealand legislation, it will be helpful in particular to state the approach taken in that jurisdiction, although, unlike our law, NZ law has an express statutory definition of "question of law", in the form of cl 5(10)(a), (b) of Schedule 2 of the Arbitration Act 1996. Nevertheless, the common statutory wording "arising out of an award" appears in both. A leading text in New Zealand, <i>Williams &amp; Kawharu on Arbitration</i> (Lexis Nexis NZ; 2011) analyses the law thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The broader approach that a question of law "arising out of an award" should not be taken to mean that the question of law must appear "on the record", (ie within the four corners of an award), will be consistent with our own statutory scheme, especially when <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42(4)</LINK> is considered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Some Governing Principles Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">Section 42</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> On the present case-authorities, a number of propositions can be stated as guidelines. We enumerate these below, without intending them to be exhaustive, since clearly the law has to be developed further.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Issue Of Recognising What Is A Question Of Law</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> It has to be stated and recognised, however, that the issue of what constitutes "a question of law" is a difficult one. Nallini Pathmanathan J in <i>Exceljade (supra)</i>, has helpfully addressed this vexed issue by drawing on the acute observations of Mustill J in <i>Finelvet AG v. Vinava Shipping Co Ltd, The Chrysalis</i> [1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 503. We reproduce the useful analysis by Nallini Pathmanathan J below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Mustill J in <i>The Chrysalis (supra)</i>, was of course referring to the English Arbitration Act 1979 (since amended) where the procedure is that of an "appeal" with leave, but the general principles and guidelines analyzed are very relevant for our purposes. To this extent, we agree with the views expressed in <i>Exceljade (supra)</i>, in highlighting the proper approach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In practical terms, we are persuaded that we should be looking at stage (2) of the process of reasoning as the proper focus of the inquiry under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>, which will mean ascertaining not so much a clear position of the "law" without regard to underlying facts, but, as analysed, the arbitrator will be ascertaining the "law" as a process comprising "not only the identification of all material rules of statute and common law, but also the identification and interpretation of the relevant parts of the contract, and the identification of those facts which must be taken into account when the decision is reached." Typically, this process will involve a mixed consideration of relevant statutory rules, case laws and legal principles, and an identification of the relevant facts on which to apply the "law".</p>
    <p>
      <b>J. This Court's Findings On The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">Section 42</LINK> Arguments</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> We have therefore considered and applied these guidelines to the Questions of Law posed by the appellant. As earlier indicated, there are six Questions of Law referred to the High Court. The learned judge allowed only two of these, namely Questions (v) and (vi). Although the learned judge did not analyse the reasons for her dismissal of the other "Questions of Law", namely (i) to (iv), we find these questions to be essentially questions of facts "dressed up" as questions of law. Hence, Her Ladyship was right in dismissing them. The same cannot, however, be said as regards Questions (v) and (vi), which reflect the earlier mentioned stage (2) in the process of reasoning addressed in <i>The Chrysalis (supra)</i>. For completeness, we quote the two relevant "Questions of Law" below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Counsel for the appellant has, in the course of her submission, questioned whether it was right to duplicate the grounds under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37</LINK> as grounds under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>. We are not persuaded why similar grounds cannot be raised under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>, if all the requirements under the section can be fulfilled. Accordingly, we agree and affirm the findings and conclusions of the learned judge of the High Court, as expressed in paras [96] and [97] of Her Ladyship's judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>K. Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In conclusion, and for the reasons stated above, we are dismissing this appeal with costs. The judgment and orders of the High Court are therefore affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Costs of this appeal is fixed as RM30,000.00 to the respondent.</p>
