      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant company via judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC')</LINK> sought to challenge the respondents' exercise of power under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Optical Discs Act 2000 ('the Act')</LINK> for the wrongful seizure of its machines and equipment which resulted in damages. The High Court and the Court of Appeal both dismissed the application. The appellant now appealed before the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The seizure challenged by the appellant in its judicial review application was an act done by the respondents' officers in the exercise of a function in relation to a criminal investigation for an offence under the Act. Such an exercise of power in the course of a criminal investigation was not open to review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 RHC</LINK>. To hold otherwise would be exposing the criminal investigative process of all law enforcement agencies in the country to constant judicial review, which could not have been the intention of Parliament. A balance must be struck between the rights of disgruntled persons, such as the appellant, to seek redress in the form of damages for the alleged wrongful seizure of its property and the duty of the investigative agency through its officers to bring wrongdoers to face justice by arresting them and collecting, in the course of investigation, whatever evidence against them. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The need to conduct prompt and unimpeded criminal investigations was well recognised by the court (<i>Ooi Ah Phua v. Officer-In-Charge Criminal Investigation, Kedah/Perlis; Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan &amp; Ors v. Tan Boon Wah</i>). If decisions made and actions taken in the process of criminal investigations pursuant to the power given by law, such as the impugned seizure in this case, were amenable to judicial review, then the criminal investigative machinery might not function as smoothly and efficiently as it should. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant was not without redress and could have filed a private law writ action for damages. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;48.;;">Section 48 of the Act</LINK> provided for a cause of action for recovery of damages if a seizure was made without reasonable cause. It followed therefore that a challenge to the exercise or a purported exercise of the power to seize the machinery and equipment should be made by way of an ordinary private law action for damages. (paras 25-26)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ahmad Maarop FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant (the applicant in the High Court) against the judgment of the Court of Appeal given on 5 April 2012 which affirmed the judgment of the High Court. The High Court had, on 9 March 2010, dismissed with costs the appellant's application for judicial review against the respondents. The appellant obtained leave from this Court of Appeal on the following questions ("the leave questions"):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts leading to this appeal are these. At the material time the appellant was in the business of manufacturing video compact discs. It was licenced under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2000_381;6.;;">reg 6(6) of the Optical Discs Regulations 2000 ("the Optic Regulations")</LINK> to manufacture optical discs from 19 March 2005 to 18 March 2006 vide licence No KCO-16/6. The Manufacturer's Code for the two machines stated in the licence were IFPI NM01 and IFPI NM02 respectively. The appellant was licensed to operate at No 200, Jalan 1, Taman Perindustrian Ehsan Jaya Kepong, 52100 Kuala Lumpur ("the licensed premises"). Vide the letter dated 20 June 2005, the Kementerian Perdagangan Dalam Negeri (KPDN) approved the appellant's application to upgrade the following two replicating machines of the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 2 March 2006, acting on information received, KPDN officers conducted a raid on the appellant's new factory at SD11, Jalan KIP 11 Taman Perindustrian KIP, 52100 Kuala Lumpur ("the new factory"), and seized the machines and equipment listed in the search list (exh L6). At the time of the raid, the appellant had yet to obtain from the respondents the approval to move its operation to the new factory. The "Staeg HamaTech" machine and "Amwell DVD Smartline" machines seized at the new factory were different from the ones in respect of which approval to upgrade was given. On 19 September 2006 the appellant filed an application for judicial review [enc 1]. The application was originally for an order of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>, as well as for declaration and damages in respect of the machinery and equipment from the new factory, which the appellant alleged was unlawfully seized. The order of <i>certiorari</i> prayed for was to quash the decision of the 2nd respondent who the appellant alleged, had decided not to release the seized machinery and equipment. The order of <i>mandamus</i> prayed for was to compel the 2nd respondent to release and return the said machinery and equipment seized within seven days from the date of the order in good functional condition. The declaration sought was for an order to declare that the decision of the 2nd defendant not to release the seized machinery and equipment was wrong in law and therefore null and void. The following special damages were prayed for:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 10 August 2009, with the leave of the court, encl 1 was amended, limiting the reliefs sought to a declaration, and an order for damages to be assessed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 r 5(1) of the RHC</LINK> provides that in an application for judicial review the court may award damages if two requirements are fulfilled. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Rule 5(1)(a)</LINK> provides for the first requirement, ie "if (the applicant) has included in the statement in support of his application for leave under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">r 3</LINK>, a claim for damages arising from any matter to which the application relates". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Rule 5(1)(b)</LINK> provides the second requirement - "if the court is satisfied that, if a claim has been made in an action begun by the applicant at the time of making his application, he could have been awarded damages." It is therefore crucial to consider the statement made by the appellant pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53;;">O 53 r 3(2) of the RHC</LINK>. It is clear from the statement made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(2) of RHC</LINK>, in support of the appellant's amended application for leave for judicial review the prayers for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> were abandoned and the prayer for the declaratory relief amended. The crux of the appellant's complaint in the amended judicial review application is therefore narrower and more specific - the impugned seizure was done without reasonable cause (and therefore wrong in law) resulting in damages to the machines and the new factory. The appellant contended it was entitled to recover damages. That was the pleaded case of the appellant. The amendment became necessary because before the application for leave for encl 1 was heard, the 2nd respondent returned the machines and equipment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It must also be noted that the prayers relating to special damages for the loss of use of an offset printing machine seized (RM3,888,000.00), the loss of revenue (RM14,688,000), cost of repair to the factory (RM185,999.00) and damages for the seized machineries referred to in para 3 of this judgment, were also abandoned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>In The Courts Below</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In his judgment the learned judge of the High Court concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Thus, although no written judgment was furnished, it must be concluded that the Court of Appeal accepted the reasoning of the High Court as well.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The First Leave Question</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the first leave question which learned counsel for the appellant submitted should be answered in the affirmative, the thrust of the learned counsel's argument was that the courts below took the view that the proper approach to challenge any exercise of power under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK> was by way of a writ of civil action rather than by judicial review. Learned counsel submitted that the decisions of the courts below were not consonant with established principles of administrative law. He contended that on the contrary, the courts in Malaysia had always been willing to acknowledge and accept the wide powers accorded under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">para 1 of the Schedule to the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. In support learned counsel referred to the majority decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_71;"><i>R Rama Chandran v. Industrial Court Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 1 MELR 71</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_725;">[1996] 1 MLRA 725</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 145; [1997] 1 CLJ 147; [1997] 1 AMR 433 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_216"><i>Hong Leong Equipment Sdn Bhd v. Liew Fook Chuan &amp; Other Appeals</i> [1996] 1 MELR 216</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 481; [1997] 1 CLJ 686; [1996] 3 AMR 3181.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In support of his contention that the proper mode to challenge the decision of a public authority would be by way of an application for judicial review, the learned counsel also referred to the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_244;"><i>Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri v. Pengarah Kebudayaan &amp; Kesenian Johor &amp; Ors</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 244</LINK>; [2008] 5 MLJ 773; [2008] 6 CLJ 473 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_145;"><i>Sivarasa Rasiah v. Badan Peguam Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 145</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 413; [2002] 2 CLJ 697; [2006] 1 AMR 11.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The thrust of the submission of the respondents is that judicial review was not the proper mode of bringing the appellant's case to court. The learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) pointed out that the judicial review application was amended on 10 August 2009, limiting it to a prayer for declaration that the seizure of the machines, equipments and goods and the damages caused to them was the result of seizure which was carried out without reasonable cause, and wrong in law. The learned SFC submitted that as a result of the amendment, the judicial review application had been transformed into an action for damages under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;48.;;">s 48 of Act 606</LINK> and the reasonable and probable cause in respect of the impugned seizure were the elements which must be proved. The learned SFC contended that the application therefore had become very much facts based and that the proper and appropriate mode for adjudicating such a case is by way of a writ for a civil action, not an application for judicial review. In support of his submission the learned SFC relied on the decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_524;"><i>Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri v. Pengarah Kebudayaan &amp; Kesenian Johor &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 524</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 145; [2010] 5 CLJ 865.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned SFC also submitted that the respondents enforcement officers were investigating into an offence suspected to have been committed under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK>. In the course of such investigations such officers were empowered under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Part VII of Act 606</LINK> to seize the machines and equipment in question. He argued that the exercise of such a statutory power was not an administrative decision and was therefore not reviewable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of RHC</LINK>. According to the learned SFC, the impugned seizure was an exercise of a statutory function under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK> and was part and parcel of the investigative process towards a criminal prosecution for an offence under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK>. In any case, the learned SFC submitted that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned seizure was lawful. In support of his submission he relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_6_212;"><i>Ahmad Azam Mohamad Salleh &amp; Ors v. Jabatan Pembangunan Koperasi Malaysia &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 6 MLRH 212</LINK>; [2004] 4 MLJ 86, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2005_2_685;"><i>City Growth Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. The Government Of Malaysia</i> [2005] 2 MLRH 685</LINK>; [2006] 1 MLJ 581; [2005] 7 CLJ 422 and <i>R v. Sloan</i> [1990] 1 NZ LR 474.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The first part of the first leave question which relates to "the exercise or the purported exercise of any power under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK>" is to our mind too general. There are a number of powers under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK> the exercise of which could be subjected to challenge. We do not think it is appropriate that a fit-all answer should be provided in relation to the exercise of any of those powers. Besides, such an answer would merely be an unnecessary academic exercise given the context and the factual matrix of this case which are comparatively within a narrow compass. In our view, in the context of the present case, the more specific question would be whether a challenge to the exercise or the purported exercise of the power to seize the machinery and equipment should be made by way of judicial review or otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In <i>Ahmad Jefri (supra)</i>, this court explained the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction by the High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the RHC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">para 1 of the Schedule to the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. It said (at pp 874-875):</p>

    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The principal issue before this court in <i>Ahmad Jefri (supra)</i> was whether the appellant could commence his action by writ or originating summons instead of an application for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 RH</LINK>C? The court considered the decision of the House of Lords in <i>O'Reilly v. Mackman</i> [1982] 3 All ER 1124 in which Lord Diplock set out the development of the law on judicial review, and highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of the English O 53 which was in <i>pari materia</i> with our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK>. This court then referred to the following statement in the judgment of Lord Diplock:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Reverting to the instant appeal, following <i>Ahmad Jefri (supra)</i>, at the outset, the preliminary question to be asked is whether the appellant's complaint or grievance is amenable for judicial review. As we have said, the complaint of the appellant in the amended judicial review application is narrower and more specific - the impugned seizure was done without reasonable cause (and therefore wrong in law) resulting in damages to the machines and the new factory, which the appellant contended it was entitled to recover. This brings into focus the power of the respondents' officers to make the seizure. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;36.;;">Section 36(1) of Act 606</LINK> provides that any Assistant Controller or a Police Officer not below the rank of Inspector shall have the power to investigate any offence under the Act. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;36.;;">s 36(2) of Act 606</LINK>, the Assistant Controller may issue orders to a licensee to further his investigation and secure compliance with the Act. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;36.;;">Section 36(3) of Act 606</LINK> provides that in addition to the powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;36.;;">s 36(1) and (2) of the Act</LINK>, an Assistant Controller investigating an offence under the Act, may exercise all or any of the powers in relation to police investigation in seizable cases given by the Criminal Procedure Code.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> To facilitate the investigation of offences under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK>, the respondents' officers are provided with the powers of search and seizure with and without warrant respectively under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">ss 38</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;39.;;">39 of Act 606</LINK>. The powers of search with a warrant are provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">s 38 of Act 606</LINK> which provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Thus under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK>, a search warrant is issued if a Magistrate is satisfied that "there is reasonable cause to believe that an offence under the Act is being or has been committed in any premises". If a search warrant is issued by the Magistrate, the Assistant Controller named in the warrant is authorised to enter the premises at any reasonable time by day or night.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">s 38(2)</LINK> an Assistant Controller may, in the premises entered (pursuant to a search warrant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK>) search and seize any article, optical disc, thing, book or document, including computerised data, "which contain or is reasonably believed to contain information as to any offence suspected to have been committed and is likely to disclose evidence of the commission of any offence under this Act".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;39.;;">Section 39 of Act 606</LINK> provides for search and seizure without warrant. It provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The effect of the section is that if there is reasonable cause to believe that an offence under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK> is being or has been committed on any premises, but the Assistant Controller has reasonable grounds for believing that by reason of the delay in obtaining a search warrant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">s 38</LINK>, the investigation would be adversely affected or evidence of the commission of an offence is likely to be tampered with, removed, damaged or destroyed, the Assistant Controller may enter the premises and exercise all of the powers referred to in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">s 38</LINK>, including the power of seizure under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;38.;;">s 38(2)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Thus it is clear to us that the seizure challenged by the appellant in its judicial review application was an act done by the respondents' officers in the exercise of a function in relation to a criminal investigation for an offence under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK>. In our view such an exercise of power in the course of a criminal investigation is not open to review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 RHC</LINK>. To hold otherwise would, to our mind, be exposing the criminal investigative process of all law enforcement agencies in the country to constant judicial review which surely could not have been the intention of Parliament. A balance has to be struck between the right of disgruntled persons such as the appellant, to seek redress in the form of damages for the alleged wrongful seizure of its property and the duty of the investigative agency through its officers to bring wrongdoers to face justice by arresting them and collecting, in the course of investigation, whatever evidence against them. In this connection the need to conduct prompt and unimpeded criminal investigation is well recognised by the court (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1975_1_75;"><i>Ooi Ah Phua v. Officer-In-Charge Criminal Investigation, Kedah/Perlis</i> [1975] 1 MLRA 75</LINK>; [1975] 1 MLJ 93, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1977_1_283;"><i>Hashim Bin Saud v. Yahaya Bin Hashim &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRA 283</LINK>; [1973] 2 MLJ 85, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_568;"><i>Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan &amp; Ors v. Tan Boon Wah</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 193; [2010] 6 CLJ 142). If decisions made and actions taken in the process of criminal investigation pursuant to the power given by law, such as the impugned seizure in this case are amenable to judicial review, then criminal investigative machinery may not function smoothly and efficiently as it should be. In this regard, we would approve the decision on similar point made by the Kuala Lumpur High Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2005_2_685;"><i>City Growth Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. The Government Of Malaysia</i> [2005] 2 MLRH 685</LINK>; [2006] 1 MLJ 581; [2005] 7 CLJ 422. In this case, the applicants sought leave to commence proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3 of the RHC</LINK> for an order of certiorari to quash an order dated 5 July 2004 made by the Deputy Public Prosecutor which was served on Hong Leong Bank Bhd and EON Bank Bhd. The orders sought to effect a seizure of, <i>inter alia</i>, movable property in the banking accounts of the applicants pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_613;50.;;">s 50(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 ('AMLA')</LINK>. The crucial question for the determination of the court was whether the said orders of the Deputy Public Prosecutor pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_613;50.;;">s 50(1) of AMLA</LINK> was reviewable by way of judicial review. In his judgment, dismissing the application for leave for an order of <i>certiorari</i>, Raus J (as His Lordship then was) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Similarly in the present appeal, the seizure was made in the course of a criminal investigation of an offence under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;;">Act 606</LINK> pursuant to the powers conferred under the Act. Such seizure clearly is not amenable to judicial review. The appellant was not without redress. It could have filed a private law writ action for damages. Indeed, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2000_606;48.;;">s 48 of Act 606</LINK> provides for a cause of action for recovery of damages if a seizure is made without reasonable cause.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Our answer to the first leave question as modified by us therefore is that, a challenge to the exercise or a purported exercise of the power to seize the machinery and equipment in this case should be made by way of an ordinary private law action for damages. This would be sufficient to dispose of the present appeal. There is no necessity for us to answer the rest of the leave questions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In the result the appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For the record, this is the last judgment involving our learned sister Zaleha Zahari FCJ.</p>
