    <p>The appellant was the administrator in respect of the estate of one Nadarajah Sithambaram Pillai ('the deceased'). The deceased, before his passing, entered into a sale and purchase agreement ('SPA') on 18 February 1982 for his 306-acre land with one Mdm Ponnamal Ramasamy ('Mdm Ponnamal'). Mdm Ponnamal purchased the land for RM3 million and paid a deposit of RM420,000. The completion date for the SPA was 18 December 1982 subject to the approval of the Foreign Investment Committee ('FIC'). Before the completion date of the SPA, the deceased passed away on 20 August 1982. Mdm Ponnamal then brought a suit ('OS 267/84') for specific performance of the SPA against the representative of the estate of the deceased on 25 February 1984. She obtained an order on 20 April 1984 appointing the 1st respondent, the deceased's brother, to represent the estate. The 1st respondent subsequently obtained probate in respect of the estate on 21 August 1984. It was not disputed that before the 1st respondent obtained the probate, the appellant was granted letters of administration of the estate on 16 August 1983. When the appellant attempted to extract the letters of administration, he was prevented from doing so by a caveat entered by the 1st respondent. When the 1st respondent applied for the probate, he did not disclose to the court the grant of the letters of administration to the appellant. The High Court allowed Mdm Ponnamal's application in OS 267/84 for specific performance. A consent order was subsequently entered between the said parties on 31 October 1984 for the due transfer of the land to Mdm Ponnamal. The appellant then brought this suit, the subject matter of this appeal, to nullify the SPA and the consent order. The appellant claimed that the SPA was a sham transaction and a cover-up of an illegal money-lending transaction. As for the consent order, the appellant claimed that the 1st respondent had acted under a false probate as the Federal Court on 17 February 1997 in a separate suit had declared the will of the deceased upon which the 1st respondent obtained the probate as forged. Therefore, the will was null and void. In the interim period, Mdm Ponnamal passed away on 25 November 1988 and her two children represented her estate, the 2nd respondents herein. It was not disputed that there was competing interest among family members in the estate of the deceased. That apart, the appellant obtained an interim <i>ex parte</i> injunction order on 15 October 1984 preventing the 1st respondent from acting for the estate and it was ordered to continue on 1 April 1985 when the 1st respondent attempted to set it aside. The injunction order also provided that the 1st respondent would act as a representative of the estate until the Official administrator ('OA') took over. The High Court found that the SPA was not a sham transaction on the evidence before the court. The High Court also found that although the 1st respondent had no authority to assent to the consent order, the Assistant Official administrator was present when the consent order was recorded and as such the OA had sanctioned the order and had the authority to do so by virtue of the injunction order ordered to continue on 1 April 1985. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court's finding and the appellant now appealed. The questions of law posed before the court raised the following issues for determination: (1) whether the 1st respondent and the OA had the capacity to assent to the consent order; (2) whether the SPA was a sham transaction; and (3) whether the non-disclosure of a pending interpleader summons by the stakeholder deposited with the title to the land invalidated the consent order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Having considered the evidence available in the Appeal Record, this court agreed with the Court of Appeal that the totality of the evidence supported the findings of the High Court that the appellant failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the SPA was a sham transaction and a cover up of an illegal money-lending transaction. In fact, in the minutes of the meeting that was held by the family of the deceased, the appellant himself had clearly recorded that the purchaser had paid the deceased the deposit of RM420,000.00 and that the balance purchase price was payable on or before 18 December 1982 as per the SPA. There was therefore no basis for appellate intervention on this issue. (paras 24-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The 1st respondent was vested with the power to bind the deceased's estate by the order of the High Court appointing him as the representative of the estate pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC')</LINK>. Before the introduction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A</LINK>, a plaintiff could not commence an action against the estate of a deceased defendant until letters of administration were extracted. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">Order 15 r 6A</LINK> enabled a plaintiff to commence action against the estate of a deceased defendant, where no grant of probate or administration had been made in respect of the estate. The rule gave the plaintiff an advantage of commencing proceedings against a deceased defendant without first ascertaining the administrator or executor of the estate and obviated the risk of limitation setting in. (paras 49-50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Mdm Ponnamal affirmed that she had always been ready and willing to complete the purchase, but as there was no legal representative of the deceased's estate, she had not been able to pay the balance of the purchase price. She further affirmed that the FIC had granted the approval for the purchase of said land. According to her, pursuant to the SPA, the deceased had already executed a transfer in favour of her nominee, and the stakeholder was deposited with the memorandum of transfer together with the document of title. She also made arrangements with the bank to obtain the necessary finance to complete the purchase and she was prepared to deposit the balance of the purchase price in court. In the circumstances, Mdm Ponnamal was entitled to file OS 267/87 for specific performance. (paras 53-54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Mdm Ponnamal's application was not dependant on any probate. The will was not the basis of her application. She made the application because no one had taken out letters of administration in respect of the estate. She affirmed that she understood steps were being taken by the 1st respondent to apply for probate. However, as there were some problems among the members of the family of the deceased it would take some time before probate was eventually obtained. It was in those circumstances that the learned judge allowed her application appointing the 1st respondent as the legal representative of the estate. Since the 1st respondent had been duly appointed as the legal representative of the estate by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A RHC</LINK>, any judgment obtained could be enforced against the estate. Therefore, the consent order was properly obtained and enforceable against the estate of the deceased. (paras 56-58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Until the OA took over validly as administrator of the estate, the 1st respondent was to continue acting as representative of the estate in the proceedings in OS 267/84 in view of the <i>ex parte</i> interim injunction order ordered to continue on 1 April 1985. In line with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39 Probate and Administration Act 1959</LINK>, the mere vesting of the assets did not authorise the OA to deal with the assets of the deceased's estate. The OA must proceed to apply for and extract the grant of letters of administration to administer the estate. In this case there was nothing to show that by 31 October 1985, the date at which the consent order was entered, the OA had applied for the letters of administration. Further, even if the <i>ex parte</i> interim injunction order to continue against the 1st respondent could be construed to be an order appointing the OA as the administrator of the estate, it was not sufficient to clothe the OA with the title and authority to act as the personal representative of the estate. Therefore, when the consent order was recorded the OA had not taken over the place of the 1st respondent and the 1st respondent was still the duly constituted legal representative of the estate when he assented to the consent order. (paras 60-61)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The stakeholder in the interpleader summons was not seeking for interpleader relief. It was agreed that the ownership of the land and the right to purchase was not in dispute. He in fact wanted the court to investigate and adjudicate whether the SPA was a mere money-lending transaction. That was not a ground for an interpleader application. In any case, if he was serious about his allegation, since he was already made a party to OS 267/84, he should pursue his allegation in that proceeding itself, rather than leave it to be questioned later by the appellant (who was not a party to OS 267/84). A party litigant could not be indifferent and negligent in his duty to place the materials in support of his contention and afterwards seek to show that that the case of his opponent was false. The stakeholder was not present at the proceedings on 31 October 1985 and was content to have Mdm Ponnamal's solicitor mention on his behalf. He therefore failed to fulfill the pre-condition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;17.;;">O 17 r 1(a) RHC</LINK> that he was being sued or expected to be sued by two or more persons making adverse claims. Therefore, the interpleader application was not properly made before the court. (para 68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The non-disclosure of the interpleader summons as a ground to challenge the validity of the consent order was an indirect way of reviving or relitigating the issue of whether the SPA was a sham money-lending transaction. The High Court had rightfully decided and the Court of Appeal had affirmed. Further, the appellant did not plead the non-disclosure of the interpleader summons as a separate and/or alternative ground in seeking to nullify and set aside the consent order. The appellant could not be allowed to succeed and obtain judgment on it on appeal. (para 72)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ahmad Maarop FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> For convenience, in this judgment the parties will be referred to as they were in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts leading to the present appeal are these. On 18 February 1982, Nadarajah s/o Dato' Sithambaram (deceased) entered into a sale and purchase agreement ("the agreement") with one Madam (Mdm) Ponnamal D/O Ramasamy to sell the land held under Grant No: 12359 Lot 1631 Mukim Teluk Bharu, in the State of Perak, measuring approximately 306 acres ("the said land"). The purchase price of the said land stated in the agreement was RM3 million out of which the deceased acknowledged receipt of RM420,000.00 as a deposit and part payment from Mdm Ponnamal. The completion date of the agreement was 18 December 1982 subject to the approval of the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 20 August 1982, the deceased passed away. He left behind an aged mother named Datin Sellayee Ammal, a brother (the 1st defendant), two sisters, and a nephew named Dr Shanmuganathan (Dr Shan). Dr Shan's father was the elder brother of the deceased who predeceased him. On 4 September 1982 and 5 September 1982, a family meeting was held to decide on the management of the affairs of the deceased's estate. The following persons attended the meeting:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The co-ordinator of the meeting was the plaintiff who also recorded the minutes of the meeting. The plaintiff was the brother-in law of Dr Shan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> According to Item 2 of the minutes of the family meeting, since Datin Sellayee (the sole beneficiary of the estate of the deceased under the law) was old and was residing in India, she would be requested to renounce her entitlement to the said land in favour of the following persons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Item 3 of the minutes of the meeting states that the plaintiff and Mr Dorairaj should administer the estate of the deceased. However, if the lawyers are of the opinion that only one administrator is sufficient then the plaintiff shall be the sole administrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Item 4 of the minutes of the meeting states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> According to the minutes of the meeting, the next family meeting would be on 9 October 1982. However, this did not take place as on 1 October 1982 Datin Sellayee died, and it seemed that in her last will and testament she left the entire estate to Dr Shan. The effect of her last will is that if it is proved, then the entire estate of the deceased will go to Dr Shan. This, according to the evidence, appeared to have triggered a number of courses of action taken with regard to the deceased's estate by certain persons who attended the family meeting; which courses of action were not in line with the direction of the course of action to be taken as recorded in the minutes of the family meeting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 8 March 1983, the 1st defendant petitioned for letters of administration for the deceased's estate. However this was not proceeded with. On the same date, acting on a power of attorney granted to him by Dr Shan, the plaintiff applied for letters of administration of the deceased's estate which was granted by the court on 16 August 1983. On 4 October 1983 a copy of the court order was served on the 1st defendant. However, when the plaintiff attempted to extract letters of administration, he was prevented from doing so by a caveat entered by the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 12 March 1984 the 1st defendant applied for a grant of probate in the Ipoh High Court (Case No: 152/84) insisting that the deceased had left a will appointing him as the executor and sole beneficiary of the deceased's estate. The 1st defendant did not disclose to the court the grant of the letters of administration to the plaintiff. On 21 August 1984 the 1st defendant obtained an order for probate to the deceased's estate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 10 October 1984, the plaintiff lodged a caveat against the grant of probate to the 1st defendant. In addition to that, on 15 October 1984 by way of an originating motion (F54/84) the plaintiff applied for in the Kuala Lumpur High Court and obtained an ex parte injunction against the 1st defendant preventing him from acting for the deceased's estate. The 1st defendant attempted to set aside that interim injunction. On 1 April 1985 LC Vohrah J (as he then was) ordered the <i>ex parte</i> injunction granted on 15 October 1984 to continue except:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned judge also ordered that this action be transferred and dealt with in the Ipoh High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 26 November 1985 the plaintiff, (in the capacity as Dr Shan's attorney), filed a writ against the 1st defendant seeking for a declaration that the will which was relied upon by the 1st defendant to obtain the grant of probate in respect of the deceased's estate was a forgery and was null and void, and that the grant of probate to the 1st defendant be revoked. As will be seen later in this judgment, the outcome of this application as declared by the Federal Court eventually on appeal, became the main plank from which the plaintiff launched his challenge to the consent order dated 31 October 1985.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Meanwhile, on the part of Mdm Ponnamal, on 16 December 1982, (ie two days before the date for the completion of the purchase of the said land), through his solicitor, Mr Seeralan, she wrote a letter to the deceased. Carbon copies of the letter were sent to the persons who attended or were represented at the family meeting on 4 September 1982 and 5 September1982. In this letter Mdm Ponnamal stated that she was ready and willing to proceed with the purchase of the said land by paying the balance of the purchase price except that there should be deductions for certain matters concerning the said land which were not disclosed at the time of the agreement, the major one being the government acquisition of about 21 acres of the said land. After receiving no response, on 23 August 1983 Mdm Ponnamal, through her solicitors Messrs Nahappanpuri and Partners, wrote to the plaintiff 's solicitor reiterating her desire to complete the purchase of the said land since the bank loan to finance it was in place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 25 February 1984 Mdm Ponnamal filed Originating Summons No: 267/84 ("OS 267/84") in the Ipoh High Court against the deceased's estate seeking for specific performance of the agreement. In that action, Mdm Ponnamal named her former solicitor, Mr Seeralan as the 2nd defendant. The reason given for roping in Mr Seeralan was that he was the stakeholder of the document of title to the said land and the memorandum of transfer duly executed by the deceased at the time of the agreement which would be required to effect the transfer of the said land to Mdm Ponnamal or her nominees. For the purpose of the proceeding in OS 267/84, Mdm Ponnamal applied by way of a summons in chambers for an order that the 1st defendant be appointed to represent the deceased's estate which order was granted by Anuar Zainal Abidin J (as he then was) on 20 April 1984.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Mdm Ponnamal proceeded with the hearing of OS 267/84. On 31 October 1985 at the hearing before Ajaib Singh J (as he then was), a consent order ("the consent order") was recorded. The order practically ordered the 1st defendant to execute all relevant transfer forms to transfer the said land to Mdm Ponnamal or her nominees, and upon registration of the transfer, the balance of the purchase price of RM2,370,135.00 (instead of RM2,760,000.00 as provided in the agreement) shall be paid by Mdm Ponnamal to the 1st defendant's solicitor who should then put it into a fixed deposit account in trust for the estate. The consent order is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The plaintiff responded promptly by filing in the Ipoh High Court Civil Suit No: 2087/85 against the 1st defendant and Mdm Ponnamal, praying for the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The 1st defendant and Mdm Ponnamal filed their defences. Mdm Ponnamal also counterclaimed against the plaintiff for the following: (a) the injunction granted by LC Vohrah J be discharged; (b) the caveat entered by the plaintiff on the estate be removed; (c) she be at liberty to enforce and carry into execution the consent order; (d) an inquiry into damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> When Mdm Ponnamal passed away on 25 November 1988, her estate was represented by her two children and they were the defendants in Civil Action 2087/85. It is this Civil Suit which eventually found its way to this court and become the subject of the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On 17 February 1997 the Federal Court declared that the will of the deceased upon which the 1st defendant obtained an order of probate on 21 August 1984 in the Ipoh High Court Petition No: 152/84, was a forgery and was null and void. The Federal Court also ordered that the probate obtained from the Ipoh High Court vide Probate Petition No: 152 of 1984 on 21 August 1984 be revoked. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_1;"><i>Dr Shanmuganathan v. Periasamy Sithambaram Pillai</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [1997] 3 MLJ 61; [1997] 2 CLJ 153; [1997] 3 AMR 3012). The plaintiff then succeeded in extracting his letters of administration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On 29 October 2001, the High Court dismissed the plantiff 's claim (in the Civil Suit No: 2087/85) with cost and allowed the 2nd defendant's counter claim as to prayers (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (g).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal. On 5 March 2010, the plaintiff 's appeal was dismissed with cost. The orders made by the High Court were affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On 7 February 2013 this court granted the plaintiff leave to appeal on the following questions ("the leave questions"):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Based on the pleadings filed by the parties, two issues were raised for the determination of the High Court. The first was whether the agreement was a sham to cover-up a money lending transaction which was not enforceable since Mdm Ponnamal was not a licensed money lender. The second was whether the consent order was a nullity and ought to set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On the first issue, upon consideration of the evidence presented before it the High Court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the agreement was a sham transaction and a cover-up of an illegal money lending transaction. The learned trial judge gave several reasons to support his findings. This is what the learned trial judge said in his judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Having considered the evidence as available in the Appeal Record in this case ourselves, we agree with the Court of Appeal that the totality of the evidence in this case sufficiently supports the aforesaid findings of the learned trial judge. Indeed, in Item 4 of the minutes of the family meeting it was clearly recorded by the plaintiff himself that the purchaser has paid to the deceased the deposit of RM420,000.00 and that the balance of RM2.58 million was payable on or before December 18 as provided in paras 1 and 2 of the agreement. There is therefore no basis for appellate intervention and we affirm the findings of the learned trial judge on the first issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> On the second issue, the learned trial judge ruled that the consent order was not a nullity. The learned trial judge opined that although the 1st defendant was not technically wrong, equitably he should not have represented the deceased's estate in agreeing to the Consent Order. However, His Lordship held that even if the 1st defendant had no authority to consent, the Official administrator (OA), by virtue of Justice LC Vohrah's order (made on 1 April 1985), had the authority to consent. This is what the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the learned trial judge. It held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> This brings us to the leave questions. In our view there is a link between the first and the third leave questions. This is necessarily so because although the High Court opined that the 1st defendant should not have represented the deceased in agreeing to the Consent Order, it nevertheless validated the consent order holding that even if the 1st defendant had no authority to give consent, the OA had the authority to do so by virtue of Justice LC Vohrah's order dated 1 April 1985. These two leave questions essentially bring into focus the role and legal capacity of the 1st defendant and the OA in relation to the deceased's estate when they appeared in OS 267/84 when the consent order was recorded. The main thrust of the plaintiff 's appeal appears to be based on these questions. We will deal with these two questions first.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The First Leave Question</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The thrust of the argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiff by his learned counsel is that a forged will is void <i>ab initio</i> and that the grant of probate and the title of the so-called executor was a nullity. The revocation of the will made the grant of probate void <i>ab initio</i>. Learned counsel relied on the Privy Council case of <i>Chan Kit San v. Ho Fung Hang</i> [1902] AC 257 where Lord Davey, speaking for the Privy Council said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff also contended that any act done by an executor under a title created by a forged will was a nullity. In support of his submission he cited <i>Pundit Paryrag Raj v. Goukaran Peshad Tewari &amp; Ors</i> 6 CWN 787 where the court held that it did not matter that the mortgage in that case was created by the executor before her probate was revoked. The court observed at p 791:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Learned counsel also referred to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1963_1_101;"><i>Sheriffa Shaikhah v. Ban Hoe Seng &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1963] 1 MLRH 101</LINK>; [1963] 1 MLJ 241 and <i>Canara Bank v. Canara Sales Corporation And Others</i> [1987] AIR SC 1603. In <i>Sheriffa Shaikhah</i> it was held that a forged Power of Attorney was a nullity and a mortgage deed created by the use of the forged Power Attorney was a nullity. In <i>Canara Bank</i> it was held that a forged cheque could give no mandate to the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Learned counsel submitted that the cases he had cited were in line with the principle that a forged instrument could create no legal rights in third parties and was void <i>ab initio</i>. Citing <i>Birch v. Birch</i> [1902] P 130 at pp 137-138 (per Cozens-Hardy LJ), learned counsel submitted that a forged will was bad against the whole world and not just the forger.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Reverting to the present appeal, learned counsel submitted that the 1st defendant consented to the consent order to transfer the estate to the 2nd defendant in his capacity as an executor under the forged will, and upon the will being declared a forgery it became void <i>ab initio</i> and all actions taken by the 1st defendant pursuant to the will were a nullity. He contended that an executor appointed by a forged will could not bind the estate because his appointment itself was void in the eyes of the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Learned counsel submitted that the first leave question should be answered in the negative and that the consent order be declared a nullity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Third Leave Question</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> According to the learned counsel for the plaintiff, the third leave question became important because the courts below opined that although the 1st defendant should not have given consent to the sale of the said land, the consent was nevertheless validated because of the presence of the OA at the proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Learned counsel submitted that as a matter of law under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;;">Probate and Administration Act 1959 (the Probate Act)</LINK>, the OA was not empowered to approve the sale of the said land without first being appointed administrator of the deceased's estate. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;60.;;">s 60(4) of the Probate Act</LINK>, the OA then had to apply to court for permission to sell the said land. Learned counsel submitted that the mistake had come about as a result of failure to distinguish between a vesting order and an administrative order. A vesting order placed the OA in the same position as a receiver holding property in interim but an administration order would empower him to deal with the property. This, according to learned counsel was the distinction between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;60.;;">s 60 of the Probate Act</LINK>. According to the learned counsel, Justice Vohrah's order dated 1 April 1985 vested the estate in the OA. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39(1) of the Probate Act</LINK>, the OA functioned only in an interim capacity like a receiver - he needed a further order to administer the estate vested in him. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1930_1_464;"><i>KALRM Karuppan Chettiar v. Subramaniam Chettiar, The Official administrator, Fms, Palaniappa Chettiar, Muthukaruppan Chettiar</i> [1930] 1 MLRH 464</LINK>; [1933] 2 MLJ 226, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_494;"><i>Selvarajah &amp; Anor v. Official administrator &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 494</LINK>; [1978] 2 MLJ 108, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_4_388;"><i>Lim Cheng Kwang v. Sivamalai Sinnathambi &amp; Anor</i> [1993] 4 MLRH 388</LINK>; [1994] 2 CLJ 59 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_5_193;"><i>Jamaliah Bte Hj Mahsudi (Suing On Her Own Behalf And As administratrix Of The Estate Of Salamah Bte Hj Ali) &amp; Ors v. Sivam a/l Munsamy &amp; Anor</i> [1998] 5 MLRH 193</LINK>; [1999] 5 MLJ 250 were cited in support of the submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Learned counsel contended that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;60.;;">s 60</LINK>, only an administrator may apply to sell intestate estate property, and thus, in the absence of a court order appointing him as the administrator of the estate, the OA could not have validly consented to the sale. Therefore his presence in the court proceedings could not in law be taken to be an assent because since he had not been appointed an administrator, he was not empowered to give any consent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Learned counsel for the 1st defendant submitted that the first leave question presupposed that only the 1st defendant granted consent on behalf of the deceased's estate which was not factually correct because when the 1st defendant gave consent as a representative of the deceased estate under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 RHC 1980</LINK>, the OA was also present in court and participated in the proceedings when the consent order was recorded. According to the learned counsel, at the very least the OA had not opposed the order of specific performance of the agreement which was sought for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> On the third leave question, learned counsel for the 1st defendant submitted that the present case is not a case of sale by the representative of a deceased's estate which could attract the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;60.;;">s 60 of the Probate Act</LINK>. According to the learned counsel, in this case the deceased executed the agreement during his lifetime. The representative of the deceased's estate consented merely to give effect to the transaction entered into by the deceased during his lifetime. The representative also had the benefit of the consensus of the beneficiaries of the deceased's estate in the form of the minutes of the meeting of the beneficiary, including the plaintiff. The 1st defendant's consent to a valid agreement which was a genuine bargain (as found by the trial court) should still stand. The 1st defendant was appointed by the court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (RHC 1980)</LINK>. It was the exclusive right of an administrator to decide whether to sell or not to sell any land in the course of his duty as administrator of the estate of the deceased person. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_101;"><i>Khaw Poh Chhuan v. Ng Gaik Peng &amp; Yap Wan Chuan &amp; Ors</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 101</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 761; [1996] 2 CLJ 185; [1996] 1 AMR 1057 was cited as the authority in support. Learned counsel submitted that the death of a seller/vendor did not vitiate a lawful agreement. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1952_1_113;"><i>Haji Osman Bin Abu Bakar v. Saiyed Noor Bin Saiyed Mohamed</i> [1952] 1 MLRH 113</LINK>; [1952] 1 MLJ 37 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1964_1_528;"><i>Kersah La'usin v. Sikin Menan</i> [1964] 1 MLRH 528</LINK>; [1966] 2 MLJ 20 were referred to in support of that submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Learned counsel also submitted that setting aside of a perfected consent order can only be made on limited ground that it was null and void for illegality or lack of jurisdiction, and that the power to set aside should only be exercised judicially in exceptional cases where the defect was of such a serious nature that there was a real need to set aside the defective order to enable the court to do justice. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Bin Mohammad Mahidin Rosli Bin Mohidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysia Finance Berhad &amp; Anor</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909 at pp 184, 202 was relied upon in support of that submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The thrust of the submission of the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant in defence of the consent order is as follows: The 2nd defendant was at all material times a <i>bone fide</i> purchaser of the land. The first leave question was misleading and it presumed that the 1st defendant consented to the consent order as an executor of the deceased's estate which was not the case because the 1st defendant was vested with the power to bind the Estate by the order of the High Court appointing the 1st defendant as the personal representative of the estate. The 1st defendant was never the executor of the estate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Learned counsel of the 2nd defendant submitted that although the injunction order by LC Vohrah J dated 15 October 1984 provided that the 1st defendant would act as the representative of the Estate for the purpose of OS 267/84 until the OA takes over, (and the OA appeared to have taken over on or about 11 September 1985), the OA consented to the 1st defendant's continued involvement in the OS 267/84 and was in any event present at the hearing of OS 267/84 which culminated in the Consent Order. As such the deceased's estate was duly represented by the OA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Learned counsel further submitted that in any event, the plaintiff was estopped from taking issue with the consent order because he had not taken any positive step to intervene in OS 267/84, and had sat by and let events occured as they did. In fact, according to the learned counsel, the plaintiff could even be described as having instigated these events. In this regard he said, by a letter dated 12 April 1985, the plaintiff 's solicitors requested the OA to take over the assets which the latter did. In his letter dated 11 September 2005, the OA said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Learned counsel contended that the OA agreed with the course of action which culminated in the granting of the Consent Order.</p>

      <b>[44]</b> With regard to the third leave question, the substance of the submission of the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant is as follows. The OA was appointed to take over as representative for the Estate by way of the varied injunction and the plaintiff was content to accept the state of affairs contemplated by the said order. Therefore, the plaintiff was precluded from contending that the OA was not in a position to make such orders as were necessary for the purpose of OS 267/84. This, according to the learned counsel, included the recording of the consent order which was the culmination of a process which involved not only the OA but the plaintiff, through solicitors. In fact, it was submitted that the OA took over representation of the estate on the urging of the plaintiff 's solicitors. In this context, learned counsel submitted that it was selfevident that the plaintiff was estopped from asserting a contravention of law in the manner which was attempted in this case. According to the learned counsel, in the circumstances of the present case, estoppel applied. In support of his submission learned counsel relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_461;"><i>Owen Sim Liang Khui v. Piasau Jaya Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 461</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 113; [1996] 4 CLJ 716; [1996] 2 AMR 2477.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Continuing his submission, learned counsel contended that in any event, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">ss 39</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;60.;;">60 of the Probate Act</LINK> did not apply. At the time OS 267/84 was commenced, and subsequently the varied injunction was granted, a letter of administration had been issued in the name of the plaintiff. Although the letter of administration was caveated by the 1st defendant, this state of affairs necessarily precluded the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39 of the Probate Act</LINK>, because it could not be said that administration had not been granted within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Learned counsel submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;60.;;">s 60 of the Probate Act</LINK> also did not apply because it applies to "personal representative" within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;60.;;">s 60(1) of the Probate Act</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> However, according to the learned counsel, the definition of "personal representatives" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;2.;;">s 2 of the Probate Act</LINK> only included, other than where liability for death duties were concerned, an executor or administrator. It was submitted that the fact pattern in this case was clearly outside the scope of the definition. According to the learned counsel, in this case, the 1st defendant was appointed pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A of the RHC 1980</LINK>. The OA was then directed by the High Court to take over as representative of the estate by way of the varied injunction. This was not an order made pursuant to, or to give effect, to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39 of the Probate Act</LINK>, nor could it have been in the circumstances. The varied injunction did not have the effect of appointing the OA in law as the executor or the administrator of the deceased's estate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Further, learned counsel submitted that the definition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;2.;;">s 2</LINK> as aforesaid did not include the OA. Learned counsel submitted that in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_185;"><i>Kerajaan Malaysia v. Yong Siew Choon</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 185</LINK>; [2006] 1 MLJ 1; [2005] 4 CLJ 537; [2006] 2 AMR 93, this court observed that by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39 of the Probate Act</LINK>, the OA became the legal representative of the Estate in question until such time as probate or legal administration was granted. Learned counsel submitted that the OA as such was not an "executor" or "administrator" as contemplated by the definition as a distinction was drawn between the two roles and a "legal representative."</p>

      <b>The First And The Third Leave Questions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> To reiterate, the plaintiff challenged the consent order on the basis that the will of the deceased (upon which the 1st defendant obtained a probate on 21 August 1984) was declared by this court on 17 February 1997 to be a forgery and was therefore null and void. The court also ordered the probate to be revoked. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the 1st defendant had consented to the consent order to transfer the said land to the 2nd defendant in his capacity as an executor under the forged will and upon the will being declared a forgery it became void <i>ab initio</i> and all actions taken by the 1st defendant pursuant to the will was a nullity. It was contended that an executor appointed by a forged will could not bind the said land because his appointment itself was void in the eyes of the law. On behalf of the 1st defendant on the other hand, it was contended <i>inter alia</i>, that the 1st defendant consented to the consent order as representative of the deceased under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 of the RHC 1980</LINK>. In a similar vein, it was contended on behalf of the 2nd defendant that the 1st defendant had not consented to the consent order as an executor but was vested with the power to bind the deceased's estate by the order of the High Court appointing the 1st defendant as the representative of the deceased's estate pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A of the RHC 1980</LINK>. We agree. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">Order 15 r 6A of the RHC 1980</LINK> provides:</p>

The rule gives the plaintiff an advantage of commencing proceeding against a deceased defendant without first ascertaining the administrator or executor of the estate and obviates the risk of limitation setting in (see <i>Malaysia Civil Procedure 2013</i> p 159).

    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Returning to the appeal before us, on 25 February 1984, Mdm Ponnamal filed OS 267/84 in the Ipoh High Court against the deceased's estate (the 1st defendant) and one Mr Seerelan, her former solicitor (the 2nd defendant), seeking for the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The facts which form the basis of Mdm Ponnamal's application as disclosed in her affidavit are as follows. On 18 February 1982 she entered into the agreement with the deceased to purchase the said land for a total consideration of RM3,000,000/= and that upon execution of the agreement she paid RM420,000/= as a deposit and part-payment of the purchase price; the balance of which was to be paid on or before 18 December 1982 but subject to the approval of the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) being obtained. Before completion of the purchase, on 20 August 1982 the deceased passed away. Mdm Ponnamal affirmed that as far as she knew, no person had taken out letters of administration in respect of the deceased's estate and that she understood that there was a dispute among members of the deceased's family, and that it would take some time before the dispute was resolved and letters of administration were granted. She affirmed that she had always been ready and willing to complete the purchase, but as there was no legal representative of the deceased's estate, she had not been able to pay the balance of the purchase price. She further affirmed that the FIC granted the approval for the purchase of the said land on 14 April 1983. According to her, pursuant to the agreement, the deceased had already executed a transfer in favour of her nominee, and the memorandum of transfer together with the document of title were deposited with the 2nd defendant who was holding the same as stakeholders. After the execution of the agreement it had come to her knowledge that sometime in 1980, the Perak State Government had acquired an area of 21 acres 1 rood 25 pole which formed part of the said land purchased by her. The deceased did not disclose this when the agreement was executed by the parties. She had been advised by her solicitors and she verily believed that in view of the said non-disclosure by the deceased, she was entitled to deduct from the balance of the purchase price, the value of the said land acquired by the Government calculated according to the purchase price as stated in the agreement. The amount to be deducted was RM209,865/=. She had also made arrangement with the bank to obtain the necessary finance to complete the purchase and she was prepared to deposit the balance of the purchase price in court. She was advised by her solicitors and she verily believed that she should deposit the balance of the purchase price in the court and obtain the court order to proceed to register the transfer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In our view, Mdm Ponnamal was entitled to file OS 267/84. Having filed the OS, she could not have proceeded further to prosecute the action to judgment without taking action to comply with the provision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. Non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4)</LINK> would render the action filed a nullity. The entire action would have been badly constituted as a matter of substantive law. For it is only in an action against the duly appointed legal representative of the estate of a deceased that a judgment may be obtained which may be enforced against the Estate. That is why <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A of the RHC 1980</LINK> makes it abundantly clear that if the terms of that order are complied with, then an order or a judgment obtained in the action shall bind the estate of a deceased person. (See the Court of Appeal judgment in <i>Yong Siew Choon v. Kerajaan Malaysia (supra)</i> at p 156). Unlike the respondent plaintiff in <i>Yong Siew Choon v. Kerajaan Malaysia (supra)</i>, where after having commenced the action against the estate of the deceased, it did nothing else save to prosecute the action to judgment, we find that in the present appeal, Mdm Ponnamal did comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. Having commenced her action in OS 267/84, she followed it up by filing the summons-in-chambers (pp 1632- 1633, Jilid 16 of the Appeal Record) applying for a Court Order appointing a person (the 1st defendant) to represent the deceased's estate for the purpose of OS 267/84 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">Order 15 r 6A(4)(a) of the RHC 1980</LINK> provides for the following two alternative situations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> It is clear from the prayer in her application and her affidavit filed in support of that application that she was not seeking for an order that the personal representative of the deceased (pursuant to a grant of probate or administration) be made a party to the proceedings in OS 267/84. So, her application was not dependant on any probate. It is true that in her affidavit she mentioned about being informed by the 1st defendant about a will purportedly executed by the deceased on 7 April 1982 appointing the former as the executor of the deceased's estate. However, no probate had been obtained. In this regard she affirmed that steps were being taken by the 1st defendant to apply for probate. However, she said that as there were some problems among the members of the deceased's family, it would take some time before the probate was obtained. It is opportune to add at this juncture that although an executor derives his title and authority from the will of his testator and not from any grant of probate, the production of the probate is the only way in which he is allowed to prove his title (see <i>SMKR Meyappa Chetty v. SN Supramaniam Chetty</i> [1916] 1 AC 603, p 608, per Lord Parker of Waddington). So, without a probate the 1st defendant's title pursuant to the will was not proven. Thus, the will was not and could not have been the basis of Mdm Ponnamal's application. Her application was not under the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4)(a) of the RHC 1980</LINK>. It is clear from the prayer in her application and the affidavit in support that she had applied to the court for an order appointing a person (the 1st defendant who was the deceased's brother) to represent the deceased's estate for the purpose of the proceedings in OS 267/84. In our view, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4)(a) of the RHC 1980</LINK> for such a person to be appointed there is no requirement that a probate or letters of administration have been granted. As we have explained, if probate or administration had been granted, the application should be under the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4) of the RHC 1980</LINK> for the personal representative of the deceased to be made a party to the proceedings. Indeed, in this case as evident from her affidavit in support of the application, Mdm Ponnamal made the application because no person had taken out letters of administration in respect of the deceased's estate. That was the basis of her application. She affirmed that she understood steps were being taken by the 1st defendant to apply for probate. However, as there were some problems among the members of the deceased's family it would take some time before the probate was eventually obtained. It was in those circumstances that on 20 April 1984, Annuar J (as he then was) allowed Mdm Ponnamal's application, and ordered the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> In our view, that order was properly made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4)(a) of the RHC 1980</LINK> and it duly appointed the 1st defendant as the legal representative of the deceased's estate for the purpose of the proceedings in OS 267/84, and more importantly, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(7)</LINK>, the court ordered that the order given or made in OS 267/84 do bind the deceased's estate. In other words, since the 1st defendant had been duly appointed the legal representative of the deceased's estate, any judgment may be obtained and enforced against the deceased's estate. To recall what was held by the Court of Appeal in <i>Yong Siew Choon v. Kerajaan Malaysia (supra)</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In our view, in the appeal before us, the provisions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A of the RHC 1980</LINK> had been complied with. The consent order against the deceased's estate which was properly represented by the 1st defendant as the duly appointed legal representative of the deceased's estate was properly obtained and was enforceable against the deceased's estate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Indeed, even LC Vohrah J's <i>ex parte</i> injunction order granted on 1 April 1985 also appeared to have recognised and given effect to the court order appointing the 1st defendant as the representative of the deceased's estate when it ordered the 1st defendant "to continue acting as representative of the estate of Nadarajah s/o Dato' Sithambaram Pillai in the High Court Originating Summons No: 267/84 until the Official administrator Malaysia take over; (b) that the Official administrator Malaysia to take charge of all the assets of the Estate of Nadarajah s/o Dato' Sithambaram Pillai".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> We have not lost sight of the fact that the 1st defendant was ordered "to continue acting as representative of the deceased's estate until the OA takes over and that the OA was to take charge of all the assets of the deceased's estate". The order must be read as a whole. The question is when did "takes over" become effective to end the 1st defendant's role as legal representative of the estate? In our view, logically, "takes over" in the order must be "takes over" validly as administrator of the estate. In other words, until the OA "takes over" validly as administrator of the estate, the 1st defendant was to continue acting as representative of the deceased's estate in the proceedings in OS 267/84. Thus, we are of the view that if that order was construed to be an order vesting all the assets of the deceased's estate in the OA, in line with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39 of the Probate Act</LINK>, mere vesting of the assets as such did not authorise the OA to deal with the assets of the deceased's estate. The OA must proceed to apply for and extract the grant of letters of administration, to administer the estate (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_696;"><i>Chay Chong Hwa &amp; Ors v. Seah Mary</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 696</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 173, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1930_1_464;"><i>KALRM Karuppan Chettiar v. Subramaniam Chettiar, The Official administrator, Fms, Palaniappa Chettiar, Muthukaruppan Chettiar</i> [1930] 1 MLRH 464</LINK>; [1933] 2 MLJ 226, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_494;"><i>Selvarajah &amp; Anor v. Official administrator &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 494</LINK>; [1978] 2 MLJ 108). Without the letters of administration, it was not competent for the OA to represent the deceased's estate in place of the 1st defendant. In this case there is nothing to show that by 31 October 1985, the OA had applied for letters of administration. Further, even if the order date 1 April 1985 could be construed to be an order appointing the OA as the administrator of the deceased's estate, it was not sufficient to clothe the OA with the title and authority to act as the personal representative of the estate. In this regard, in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_40;"><i>Jigarlal Kantilal Doshi v. Amanah Raya Berhad</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 40</LINK>; [2011] 9 CLJ 361, this court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In this case there is nothing to show that by 31 October 1985 the OA had been issued by the Court Registry under the seal of court, with letters of administration. Thus, he was not competent to act as personal representative of the deceased's estate in the proceedings in OS 267/84. That being the case it cannot be said that on 31 October 1985 the OA had taken over in place of the 1st defendant. In short, in either case, on 31 October 1985, the OA had not taken over from the 1st defendant. Thus, on 31 October 1985 the 1st defendant was still the duly constituted legal representative of the deceased's estate when he assented to the consent order which, in our view, was properly made and enforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In view of what we have said thus far, we find it unnecessary to answer the first and the third leave questions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Second Leave Question</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The thrust of the submission by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in respect of the second leave question is as follows. The draft of the consent order which was settled between the solicitors for the 1st and the 2nd defendants respectively, two days before the recording of the of the Consent Order. It was tendered before Ajaib Singh J for approval on 31 October 1985. It was recorded by the learned judge as if it was an uncontested matter without any controversy surrounding it. The attention of the learned judge was not brought to the interpleader summons taken out in the same proceedings (OS 267/84) by the solicitor, Mr Seeralan, or the affidavits filed by him in support of that interpleader summons which challenged the agreement transacted between the deceased and Mdm Ponnamal as not being a genuine sale. The consent order records Mr Seeralan as being absent as if he had stayed away from the proceedings although served, whereas Mr Seeralan had notified the court and the solicitors for the 1st and the 2nd defendants of his absence, and that he would "abide by any decision of the court or to act under the Directions of the court". Mdm Ponnamal's solicitor was requested to mention on Mr Seeralan's behalf. Mr Seeralan (since deceased) was the former solicitor for Mdm Ponnamal, who drafted the agreement. Upon being served with the Originating Summons in OS 267/84, Mr Seeralan through his solicitors took out an Interpleader Summons declaring that he had no personal interest in the property but asking the court to determine who was entitled to the title in his custody. In his supporting affidavit he alleged that the sale was in fact a disguise for a money lending transaction. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that it was obligatory for the 1st and 2nd defendants to bring to the Interpleader Summons to the attention of the learned judge for him to decide on the interpleader. As that was not done, the consent order was made without the interpleader being decided on whether the sale was a genuine sale. Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there was no explanation from both defendants as to why that Interpleader Summons was not disclosed to the Court on 31 October 1985. It was contended that in the result, the Ipoh High Court approved the draft consent order without being informed of the Interpleader Summons and the affidavits impugning the sale. The Interpleader Summons was never adjudicated or dismissed. The High Court therefore did not adjudicate on the question whether the agreement was a genuine sale or a disguised money lending transaction. It was contended that it was obligatory for the 1st and 2nd defendants to bring to the attention of the learned judge the Interpleader Summons for him to decide on it. As this was not done, the consent order was made without the interpleader being decided on whether the impugned sale was a genuine sale or a disguised money lending transaction. It was contended that the consent order was approved by the court without full disclosure of the relevant facts by the parties who obtained the order. It was also contended that the 1st and the 2nd defendants had acted collusively with each other to obtain the order by keeping out the plaintiff, and without full disclosure. The consent order was therefore vitiated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;44.;;">s 44 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. It was submitted that where the court was led into making an order without disclosure of all the facts, such an order could not stand. In support of that submission, learned counsel relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_98;"><i>Chee Pok Choy &amp; Ors v. Scotch Leasing Sdn Bhd</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 98</LINK>; [2001] 4 MLJ 346; [2001] 2 CLJ 321; [2001] 3 AMR 2609, <i>Shripadgouda v. Govindgouda</i> [1941] AIR Bombay 77 and <i>Meek v. Fleming</i> [1961] 3 All ER 148.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> For the 1st defendant, it was submitted that the second question was predicated on matters which had not been pleaded. Since the question was never in issue in the courts below, it should not be an issue before us. For the 2nd defendant, it was submitted that the second question was misleading as the Interpleader Summons was not made an issue by Mr Seeralan. According to the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant, Mr Seeralan in fact left the matter to the court after having informed the Registrar that he would abide by any order of the court. Had it been an important matter, Mr Seeralan would have taken issue with OS 267/84, which he failed to do. Learned counsel contended that therefore it was not open to the plaintiff to seek to do so in the High Court action (the Ipoh High Court Civil Suit No: 2087/85) the decision in which is the subject matter of the instant appeal. Learned counsel also submitted that adjunct to this, was the undisputed fact that the plaintiff failed to take any active steps to intervene in OS 267/84. This, it was submitted, was an election to abandon any challenge to jurisdiction, and thus an implied acceptance of jurisdiction. It was argued that the plaintiff could not subsequently take an inconsistent position. In support of his submission learned counsel referred to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_530;"><i>Bauer (M) Sdn Bhd v. Daewoo Corporation</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 530</LINK>; [1999] 4 MLJ 545; [1999] 4 CLJ 665; [1999] 4 AMR 4557 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_284;"><i>Lai Yoke Ngan &amp; Anor v.

      <b>[65]</b> The second leave question makes specific reference to the pending Interpleader Summons. So, the starting point is to ask whether the pending Interpleader Summons (Seeralan's Summons-In-Chambers) (see pp 1642- 1643, Appeal Record, vol 16) is in fact an Interpleader Summons? Interpleader Summons as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;17.;;">O 17 r 1(a) RHC 1980</LINK>, is the provision for what is styled as stakeholder's interpleader, which is the applicable provision in the context of the present case. The whole object of the interpleader provision is to enable a person in the position of a stakeholder to get relief from the court and get it decided as to which of the two or more claimants he has to account for the money, goods or chattels which he holds. So, as provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;17.;;">O 17 r (1)(a) RHC 1980</LINK>, the state of being sued or the expectation to be sued in respect of those goods "by two or more persons making adverse claims", is the precondition which the applicant must fulfil to give the court the jurisdiction to exercise discretion to grant the relief, provided under O 17. There must be some real foundation for such expectation. In this regard, even a letter from one of the adverse parties containing a direction and warning to the interpleader not to release the contested documents of titles, for example, could not be construed as a claim from that party. This is clear from the judgment of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_4_181;"><i>Tetuan Teh Kim Teh Salina &amp; Co v. Tan Kau Tiah &amp; Anor</i> [2013] 4 MLRA 181</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 313; [2013] 5 CLJ 161; [2013] 5 AMR 97, where the court said:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> On the mode of the application under O 17 this court said:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> In his affidavit in support of his purported interpleader application, Mr Seeralan stated that on 18 February 1982 Mdm Ponnamal's husband agreed to lend $300,000/= to the deceased to be repaid on or before 18 December 1982. Out of the said sum, $120,000/= represented interest. Mr Seeralan stated that he was instructed to draw up the relevant documents in the name of Mdm Ponnamal, and to include $120,000/= claimed by way of interest in the principal sum thereby making a total of $420,000/=. To secure the loan, Mr Seeralan drew up a document purported to show that the deceased had agreed to sell to the plaintiff the said land for a sum of $3,000,000/=. According to Mr Seeralan, the real value of the said land in 1982 exceeded $5,000,000/=. The deceased died on 20 August 1982 before the money lent was due for payment. Mr Seeralan then deposed the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Paragraph 9 of Mr Seeralan's affidavit is crucial. It is evident that Mr Seeralan was not seeking for interpleader relief as a person who was vexed by suits from two or more person making adverse claims. Paragraph 9 embodies his real complaints. His first complaint was that Mdm Ponnamal's claim against the 1st defendant was untenable because he alleged that no letters of administration has been extracted. This is not and cannot be a ground for an interpleader application. In any case this is not true because as alluded to earlier in this judgment, on 20 April 1984, the High Court had made an order appointing the 1st defendant to represent the Estate under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6A(4)(a) of RHC 1980</LINK>. Mr Seeralan's other complaint was that according to him as there are serious questions in dispute, Originating Summons procedure was not an appropriate means of disposing the dispute. This is reinforced by his subsequent affidavit when he stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He was not actually seeking for interpleader relief. That was not the purpose of his application. He himself agreed that the ownership of the land and the right to purchase was not in dispute. What he wanted the court to do was beyond that. He wanted the court to investigate and adjudicate whether the sale was mere money lending transaction. Again this is not and could not be a ground for an interpleader application. In any case, if he was serious about his allegation, since he was already made a party to OS 267/84, he should pursue his allegation in that proceeding itself, rather than leaving it to be questioned later by the plaintiff (who was not a party to OS 267/84). A party litigant cannot be indifferent and negligent in his duty to place the materials in support of his contention and afterwards seek to show that that the case of his opponent was false. (See <i>SP Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jaganath</i> [1994] AIR 853, per Kuldip Singh J). As it transpired, Seeralan was not present in the proceeding on 31 Ocotber 1985 and was content to have Mdm Ponnamal's solicitor mention on his behalf. In our view, Mr Seeralan failed to fulfil the precondition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;17.;;">O 17 r 1(a) RHC 1980</LINK> that he was being sued or expected to be sued by two or more persons making adverse clims. Thus, the so called interpleader application was not properly before the court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;17.;;">O 17 RHC 1980</LINK> to clothe it with the jurisdiction to consider the interpleader application first before considering OS 267/84.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Be that as it may the more important question which must be considered is whether the point raised in the second leave question was pleaded by the plaintiff? Although the challenge as to the genuineness of the sale, (ie whether it was a disguised money lending transaction) was mentioned in the leave question, that is not the focus of the leave question. From the leave question what was not brought to the attention of the court (in other words not disclosed to the court) was the pending Interpleader Summons. Thus, it is clear that the focus of the second leave question is the Interpleader Summons which it was alleged was not brought to the attention of the court. The question then raised is whether in such a case the consent order is valid? In the nutshell the contention of the plaintiff in respect of the second leave question is that Seeralan's Interpleader Summons must be disclosed by the 1st or the 2nd defendant to the court. In other words, since it was an Interpleader Summons, it must first be decided by the court before it could consider OS 267/84. Failure to do so vitiated the consent order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;44.;;">s 44 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. That section provides that any party to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment, order or decree which is relevant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;40.;;">ss 40</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;41.;;">41</LINK>, or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;42.;;">42 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, and which has been proved by the adverse party, (a) was delivered by a court not competent to deliver it, or (b) was obtained by fraud or collusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> In our view, the point raised by the plaintiff in the second leave question constitutes a specific ground of challenge on the validity of the Consent Order. This ground of challenge is separate and different from the grounds already pleaded by the plaintiff in his pleading in impugning the consent order and praying for it to be set aside. In forming such a view we have not lost sight of para 16 of the amended statement of claim which contains the following averment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> The matters aforesaid in the above paragraph are matters pleaded in para 1 to para 15 of the amended statement of claim (Jilid 2, Record Rayuan, p 138 to p 143). For completeness we set out those paragraphs below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> Those paragraphs of the amended statement of claim amongst others, contain averments about the plaintiff and the defendant being in dispute as to who was the lawful administrator of the Estate of the deceased, the plaintiff being the administrator of the Estate vide the court order dated 16 August 1983, the 1st defendant purporting to be the executor of the deceased's estate and obtaining an order of probate in the High Court Petition No: 152 of 84 relying on an alleged will of the deceased dated 7 February 1982 without disclosing to the High Court of the prior grant of Letter of administrator (LA) to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's action to impeach the alleged will in Originating Motion No: F 54 of 1984 culminating in the Federal Court Order on 17 February 1997 declaring the alleged will to be a forgery. Consequently, it was averred by the plaintiff that the 1st defendant could not claim any right or justification for his action under the forged will, and accordingly, all actions and sanctions or consent given or steps taken by the 1st defendant in his capacity as executor under the said Grant of Probate were void. Clearly, that essentially is the pleaded case of the plaintiff in seeking to set aside the consent order as being a nullity/or null and void. Of course lest it be forgotten, the other material matter pleaded was that the agreement in reality was a sham money lending transaction. But as we have said earlier, the focus of the second leave question is not the averment that the sale was a sham money lending transaction itself, but the non-disclosure of the interpleader summons filed by Mr Seeralan. Indeed, the issue of whether the sale was a sham money lending transaction was adjudicated in the trial before the High Court which concluded (and in our view rightly) that the plaintiff had failed to prove on the balance of probability that the agreement was a sham transaction for the cover up of an illegal money lending transaction. In fact in arriving at that conclusion the learned High Court Judge had among other evidence, duly considered Mr Seeralan's allegation in his affidavit that the sale was a cover up for a money lending transaction. (See paras 24 to 25 of this judgment). It appears to us that the non-disclosure of the Interpleader Summons as a ground of challenge to the validity of the consent order was an indirect way of reviving or relitigating the issue of whether the sale was a sham money lending transaction which had been decided by the High Court (and the decision of which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal). More importantly, we find that the non disclosure of the Interpleader Summons filed by Mr Seeralan under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;17.;;">O 17 r 1(a) of the RHC 1980</LINK> was never pleaded by the plaintiff as a separate and/or alternative ground in seeking to nullify and set aside the Consent Order. Since this issue and the material facts to support it were not pleaded by the plaintiff in his amended statement of claim, the plaintiff could not be allowed to succeed and obtain judgment on it on appeal. In the circumstances we do not find it necessary to answer the second question (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_459;"><i>Ambank (M) Berhad v. Luqman Kamil Mohammed Don</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 459</LINK>; [2012] 3 CLJ 551, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_2_6;"><i>Lee Ah Chor v.

    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> In the result and for the reasons we have given the plaintiff 's appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
