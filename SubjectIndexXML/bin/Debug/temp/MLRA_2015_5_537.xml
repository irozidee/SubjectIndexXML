    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was an appeal by all three appellants who had been jointly charged for trafficking in dangerous drugs. At the material time, acting on information received regarding a drug transaction which was to take place at a hotel, the police had observed the movements of the three appellants in the hotel. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants had occupied one room, while the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant had occupied a separate room. Upon arresting all three appellants outside the hotel, the police had done a search on both rooms and found substances in two bags, P9 and P10, in the room occupied by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants. Those substances were later confirmed by the chemist to be methamphetamine ('the drugs'). The police also recovered a pair of long black pants ('the pants') in P10 which disclosed a mixed DNA profile of two females, one of which was consistent with the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant. At the close of the prosecution's case, the trial judge was satisfied that a <i>prima facie</i> case was made out and called for the appellants' defence. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants gave identical statements from the dock in that they had been approached by one Janah Elizabeth ('Janah') to come to Malaysia to collect certain materials contained in P9 and P10, and therefore they argued that they were in the circumstances innocent carriers who had been cheated. On the other hand, the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant in her statement contended that she had got acquainted recently with the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants while staying at the hotel and that the drugs were not found on her or the room she was occupying. At the end of the trial, the trial judge found that all three appellants failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and found them guilty of the said charge, and imposed on them the mandatory sentence of death. In this appeal, the main issues to be decided were, whether the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants were merely innocent carriers; whether there was a gap in the prosecution's case against the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant; whether there was conclusive evidence that the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant had possession or knowledge of the drugs; and whether the trial judge erred in finding the three appellants guilty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants' appeal; allowing the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The trial judge had meticulously analysed the evidence and had set out in the grounds of judgment as to why the court was not satisfied that a reasonable doubt had been raised on the prosecution's case. Looking at the evidence in totality, both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants could not exculpate their involvement in the trafficking of the drugs by claiming that they were merely innocent carriers. There was no effort made by both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants to bolster the genuineness, if at all, of the so called defence, which was tendered only when they had been actually apprehended. Further, the trial judge was not in error when the court ruled that both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants had not at the earliest available opportunity raised the issue about the very existence or the role of Janah. Accordingly, there was no reason to interfere with the finding of guilt and sentence imposed by the trial judge against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants. (paras 44-48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, a material fact to be noted was that there were no drugs found in the room occupied by the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant nor was there any other incriminating evidence found on her person. The prosecution's case to link the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant to the drugs was premised on P10. However, there was no evidence that P10 had remained completely intact between the time it left the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's room and when it was searched in the room occupied by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants. Further, the possibility that P10 could have been tampered with during that interim period to include the drugs within it could not be ruled out at all. (paras 53-54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The remaining piece of evidence relied upon by the prosecution was the pants found in P10. In this instance, since there was another DNA profile belonging to another unidentified female derived from the pants, such evidence could not amount to conclusive evidence that the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant was responsible for concealing the drugs in P10, much less that she had 'possession' of the same, in the physical sense, or that it could be reasonably inferred that she had 'knowledge' as to the drugs found in P10. Accordingly, the defence had cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case presented against the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant and her conviction on the charge brought against her was therefore not safe in the circumstances.

    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> There were three appeals before us. The respective appellants were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> A1, A2 and A3, all women, had been jointly charged at the Kuala Lumpur High Court. The charge proffered against them was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The learned trial judge had on 18 July 2012 found all the accused guilty of the said charge and had imposed on them the mandatory sentence of death by hanging under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (DDA)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In these appeals before us, having heard and considered the submissions of respective counsel for the accused and the learned Timbalan Pendakwa Raya for the Public Prosecutor, we had on 17 March 2014 unanimously:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The learned trial judge had in the Grounds of Judgment (167 pages) elaborately dealt with the facts of the case and had highlighted the relevant as well-significant evidence adduced by the prosecution (through some 15 witnesses) against all the three accused. The learned trial judge had held that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out at the close of the prosecution's case and proceeded to order the accused to enter their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The options open to the accused were explained to the accused by the court and all the accused elected to make their defence by issuing respective statements from the dock. At the close of the defence case, the learned trial judge ruled that no reasonable doubt had been raised by any one of the accused in defence to the case adduced by the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The evidence led by the prosecution showed that A1 and A2 had together on the night of 5 July 2009 checked into Winsin Hotel at Jalan Petaling Kuala Lumpur and occupied room 409. A1 and A2 continued to occupy that room till 7 July 2009. A3 on the other hand checked into the same Hotel on the morning of 7 July 2009 at about 8.00am and had been allotted the use of room 305.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Acting on information that a transaction involving drugs was to take place at Winsin Hotel involving a Thai woman, SP6 had led a police raiding party on 7 July 2009 and had arrived at the Hotel at about 8.30am. He was informed that the Thai woman was in room 305. He then booked the adjoining rooms 304 and 308 and detailed SP10 to observe room 305 while seated in the corridor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At about 11.00am SP10 notified SP6 that a woman had entered room 305. Subsequently this woman left room 305 with a bluecoloured haversack-bag. SP10 was unable to follow that lady. SP6, SP10 and SP8 then proceeded to the lobby of the Hotel to observe movements of this lady through the CCTV.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> A3 then left the Hotel and SP6 instructed his men to follow her. Subsequently A1 and A2 came down the lift and went out of the Hotel too. SP8 and SP10 observed their movement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> According to the Police witnesses, A1 and A2 met up with A3 on the road outside the Hotel. SP6 instructed his officers to arrest all three women. All three women were brought back to the Hotel after their arrest; the keys to room 409 were found on the person of A2 while the keys to the room 305 were found on A3.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> A1, A2, A3 were taken together to both the rooms. The first search was made at room 305. Nothing was found in that room except some personal clothing spread out on the bed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> A1, A2, A3 and the police party then moved to room 409. At this room, SP6 found an unlocked big black suit case (Vitrsen)(P9) on the right side of the door. On inspection of this bag it was discovered that it had a concealed compartment and upon prising open the same, a brownish plastic packet containing some substance in crystalline form and also in powder form was discovered (marked RIA).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Another bag blue-black in colour (Jack Wolfskin)(P10), also unlocked, was found in this room too and upon close examination, two dark coloured plastic-wrapped packages were found concealed also containing crystalline and powdery substance in it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Clothing and documents were also seised by SP6 from this room. Some of the personal clothing were found stuffed in the two bags.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> All the three packages were sent for analysis and the report from the Chemistry Department was that the substance seised was methamphetamine with a net weight (after analysis) of 3421.5 grams (as against a gross weight of 4462.6 grams excluding the plastic cover).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> A1, A2 and A3 also consented to their blood being taken for DNA analysis. The clothing recovered had been previously matched by being individually worn and identified by A1, A2 and A3 separately (PT3-A, PT3-B and PT3-C).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Report from the Scientific Officer at the Chemistry Department was that there was only one partial match of DNA, namely a pair of black long pants (PT3-(iii)a - from PT3-C) which disclosed a mixed DNA profile of two females - one of which was consistent or probable with the source represented by blood sample 'C' (labelled 'Miss Supharak Chomphuprahet), the accused A3. This black long pants had been recovered by SP6 from the bag P10 found in room 409.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The prosecution's case essentially was that the drugs were recovered from the bags found in room 409 occupied by A1 and A2. The Hotel CCTV recordings adduced in evidence clearly showed that the big black suit case - P9 was seen to be one brought in by A1 and A2 when they checked in; furthermore their clothing were also recovered in that bag. The prosecution's contention was that P10 was the bag (haversack) seen in similar CCTV recording brought in by A3 on 7 July 2009 and subsequently seen by SP10 to have been taken out by A2 from room 305 when A2 was seen exiting from that room earlier in the morning of 7 July 2009. Also, the black long pants with the DNA Profile of A3 (partial/mixed) was found in P10 (the same haversack).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Close Of Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> At the close of the prosecution case based essentially on the salient facts summarised above, the learned trial judge stated in her grounds of judgment that the court had subjected the evidence before it in its totality to maximum evaluation (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_547;"><i>Balachandran v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 547</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 301; [2005] 1 CLJ 85; [2005] 1 AMR 321 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_590;"><i>PP v. Mohd Radzi Abu Bakar</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 590</LINK>; [2005] 6 MLJ 393; [2006] 1 CLJ 457; [2005] 6 AMR 203; <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>). The learned trial judge was satisfied that the prosecution had established a <i>prima facie</i> case against all three accused. The court held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Her Ladyship went on to state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As regard 'common intention' the learned trial judge noted that although under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 Penal Code</LINK> the relevant pre-planning or preconcert may develop on the spot or during the course of the commission of the offence, the crucial test was that such plan must precede the act constituting the offence. The existence of common intention was a question of fact which could be inferred from the circumstances of each particular case. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_711;"><i>Wan Yurillhami Wan Yaacob &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 711</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 749; [2010] 1 CLJ 17).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> As the quantity of the methamphetamine seised has crossed the threshold to trigger the presumption of 'trafficking' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(xvi) of DDA</LINK>, the learned trial judge held that the A1, A2 and A3 were deemed to be 'trafficking' unless the contrary was proved by the three accused persons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned trial judge cautioned herself that without the requisite mens rea possession or animus possidendi of the drugs, the presumption of trafficking would not arise. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_311;"><i>Muhammed Hassan v. PP</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 311</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 273; [1998] 2 CLJ 170; [1998] 1 AMR 829). The learned trial judge held that there were two elements required to be proven to satisfy <i>mens rea</i> possession. The first element was the physical element, namely that the accused were in custody and control of the dangerous drugs and had the power of disposal over the same (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_2_770;"><i>PP v. Ouseng Sama-Ae</i> [2007] 2 MLRA 770</LINK>; [2008] 1 CLJ 337). This had been satisfied as the drugs were found in the two bags in room 409 (occupied by A1 and A2), the larger one of which (P9) as evidenced by the CCTV recording (and the still photographs derived from the recording) was the same bag brought into the hotel by A1 and A2 when they checked in. As regards the other bag, the haversack (P10), the learned trial judge's conclusion was that on the evidence of SP10 and the CCTV recordings, it was the same bag that A3 had brought with her when she checked in on 7 July 2009 and which was subsequently taken by the lady identified as A2 from room 305 that same morning. A1, A2 and A3 therefore had the custody and control over the bags in which the drugs were found; their clothes were also found in the bags.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The learned trial judge was also of the view the acts or conduct of A1, A2 and A3 fell well within the meaning of the words 'keeping', 'giving', transporting' and 'carrying' in the definition of 'trafficking' in s 2 of DDA. It was also observed by the court that there was no need to prove that any of the accused had exclusive possession of the room or for matter the bags (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_495;"><i>PP v. Denish Madhavan</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 495</LINK>; [2010] 5 CLJ 635).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The second element that had to be proven by the prosecution was the mental element, that the accused had knowledge that the concealed substance was drugs. Since it was almost impossible to prove the mental element of knowledge, the law, it was observed by the court, permitted an inference to be drawn from the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the substance (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In this respect, the learned trial judge held that the fact that the drugs were concealed in secret compartments and the evidence of the arresting officers, especially of PW10, that by demeanour the three accused appeared anxious and scared when confronted and arrested, was sufficient basis for the court to draw an irresistible inference that A1, A2 and A3 all knew the nature of the contents of the three plastic packages found concealed in the two bags.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The learned trial judge conclusion was recorded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> As regards how A3 was implicated in the alleged crime, the learned trial judge observed specifically as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And further down in the grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And also:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As noted earlier, A1, A2 and A3 elected to make statements from the dock in defence. The written statements read out by A1 and A2 were almost identical. They said they were from Jakarta and had been separately approached by one Janah Elizabeth (Janah), to come to Malaysia to collect certain 'barang perniagaan' for Janah's import/export business. Janah told them that all expenses will be borne by Janah's company and each of them will be paid 8 million rupiah upon completion of the job. A1 and A2 only met each other and was introduced by Janah one to the other at the Airport. They were given some cash each and were to travel to Kuala Lumpur through Batam and Johore. At Kuala Lumpur, as instructed by Janah, they were to collect a big black bag from a foreigner at a McDonald Restaurant near Puduraya. They then checked in at Hotel Winsin at Petaling Street. Janah then told them to wait a few days as some further merchandise was to be collected before they returned to Jakarta.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> A1 and A2 went on to state that Janah subsequently called them to collect a bag from a person in room 305 which A2 did. They had placed their clothing in both the big bag and the bag collected from room 305. They had then gone out of the Hotel for a meal when they were arrested and brought back to the Hotel. Upon search of the bags in room 409, the packages wrapped in plastic were discovered. They denied that they knew that the bags contained the drugs concealed in the secret compartments. They also denied that they were aware that it was drugs that they were to collect for Janah and if they had known that they would not have accepted the temporary job from Janah at all.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> They (A1 and A2) said they had made statements to the police after their arrest where they had explained in detail what had happened and that all was done at Janah's instructions, whom they had trusted. Counsel for A1 and A2 argued that the accused were in the circumstances 'innocent carriers' who had been cheated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> A3 in her dock statement stated that she was on transit in Kuala Lumpur on a return flight from Johannesburg to Bangkok and her boyfriend had arranged for her to stay in Winsin Hotel. She had checked into room 305 on 7 July 2009 and subsequently an Indonesian woman with whom she got acquainted recently (at the Lobby of the Hotel) had visited her in the room. She had then left the Hotel for a stroll outside when she was arrested and brought back to the Hotel. The Police had searched her room 305 but no contraband was discovered there. She was then taken to another room upstairs where upon a search of two bags there, the alleged drugs were discovered.</p>

      <b>At The End Of Trial</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The learned trial judge at the close of the defence case was not satisfied that the defence from the dock of the accused considered 'separately and together' had cast any doubt in the prosecution's case. Her Ladyship did not believe that A1 was telling the truth as the bag received from the person at MacDonald was a heavy one and reasonably A1 would have been expected to examine or inspect the contents of the bag. A1 had even put her own clothes into the bag and clearly this was intended to pass off the luggage as belonging to her.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Both A1 and A2, the learned trial judge noted, had failed to put their defence at the first available opportunity to the prosecution's witnesses, namely, their version that they had received a phone call from Janah while they were checking in at the Hotel and even subsequently; for this reason the Investigation Officer did not find it necessary to carry out any forensic check on their handphones seised by the police. It was also noted by the trial judge that PW6, PW8 and PW10 were not cross-examined on this either when they gave evidence, namely, in respect of A1 and A2's version of Janah's role and involvement in the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Further, the claim of A1 and A2 that they had given information as to the existence and role of and that they had acted on instructions from 'Janah' was only raised towards the end of the prosecution's case when PW11 (the IO) was on the stand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Also A2 had herself confirmed that she had collected a black bag from the person at room 305 on 7 July 2009. The learned trial judge was of the view that A2 should have been put on suspicion because the bag was heavy and when she opened it to put her clothes in, she would have discovered that there obviously were no 'trade goods/merchandise' in that bag.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> As for A3, the learned trial judge was of the view that although A3 attempted to distance herself from A1 and A2, the evidence especially showed that the bag P10 was brought into the hotel by A3 and that was the same bag that A2 had subsequently confirmed to have taken out form room 305. The court held that in the circumstances the denial of A3 that she had custody, control or care or dominion of either or both the bags, was a bare denial and did not cast any doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal And Our Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A1 And A2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The thrust of the submissions of counsel for A1 and A2 before us was that the two accused were 'innocent carriers' and could not be held to have had 'knowledge' that the concealed packages in both the bags were drugs. The learned trial judge therefore, it was contended, had not given sufficient consideration to A1 and A2's defence at the close of the case to impose culpability on them for the crime charged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> It was urged upon us that A1 and A2 did not attempt to flee nor did they put up any resistance when apprehended. Further both the bags at room 409 had been left unguarded and unlocked. Such conduct was inconsistent with any inferred or imputed 'knowledge' on the part of A1 and A2 that there were drugs concealed or hidden in the bags, much less of any intention to 'traffic' such contraband. Further P9 had been collected by A1, A2 from another person at the McDonalds Restaurant, while P10 was taken from room 305.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It was submitted that the fact that A1 and A2 appeared to be 'cemas dan takut' when arrested as per SP10's evidence and the further fact that their clothes were found in the two bags were not sufficient for the learned judge to draw an inference that A1 and A2 had knowledge that there was illicit substance concealed in the bags in the secret compartments, as it were, or such substance were drugs since the bags had to be ripped open to disclose this. By all accounts therefore, A1 and A2 had raised a reasonable doubt that they were innocent carriers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> It was also urged upon us that there was a 'gap' in the prosecution's case in that the prosecution had failed to send the handphones seised from A1/A2 for forensic tests to confirm whether there was indeed the phone calls from Janah as claimed by the accused; such investigation would have shown that A1 and A2 were indeed innocent carriers. It would also had shown there were no phonecalls between A3 and A1/A2 indicate any 'preplanning' or common intention between them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> It was contended before us that although it was true that only when SP11 was questioned on the stand, did counsel for A1 and A2 raise the issue that in their respective cautioned statements, the accused had already mentioned the involvement of 'Janah' and this part of their statement had not been recorded by the recording officers, the prosecution still had the opportunity to call the recording officers to confirm or deny the same and/or to undertake further investigation, that is before the prosecution closed their case; this was not done. It was also submitted that in so far as there was a failure to undertake investigations on (a) the 'hand-phone' recordings, and (b) on 'Janah' mentioned to the officers who took down the cautioned statements of A1 and A2, defence of A1 and A2 (albeit unsworn and from the dock) had raised a 'reasonable doubt' and the trial judge ought to have drawn an adverse inference against the prosecution based on that defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In our assessment, is so far the appeal by A1 and A2 was concerned, we could not agree with counsel that learned trial judge had erred when Her Ladyship at the close of the prosecution case had called for their defence and in any event had not given due consideration to the defence, though only made by way of statements from the dock entered by the said accused. We must observe here that the learned trial judge had meticulously analysed the evidence and had set out in the grounds of judgment, why the court was not satisfied that a reasonable doubt had been raised at all on the prosecution's case made out against A1 and A2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Looking at the evidence in totality, A1 and A2 could not exculpate their involvement in the trafficking of the seised drugs by saying that they were merely 'innocent carriers' in this transaction. In our view, how could they be 'innocent', when they voluntarily agreed to come over to another country from their own to merely collect and return with some 'merchandise' for a recently met third party without enquiring further as to what was the nature of the business of that third party or of the nature or details of the material to be brought back to Indonesia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> A1 and A2 had without undertaking any such enquiry, which they would have been reasonably expected to make in any event, had agreed to collect two 'bags', not merely some 'parcel', to be brought back to Indonesia. Their trip here itself was nebulous and only lasting for just a few days; they had also only brought with them very little personal clothing. There was no other ostensibly legitimate purpose for coming here. As noted by the learned trial judge, the bags turned out to be heavy ones and they should have been put an enquiry even at that stage and ought to have rightfully refused to carry out such an assignment if no satisfactory explanation as to its contents was forthcoming from 'Janah' who they were in contact with. There was no such effort made by A1 and A2 to bolster the genuineness, if at all, of the so called defence tendered only when they had been actually apprehended red handed, so to speak.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> We also must state that the learned trial judge was not in error when the court ruled that A1 and A2 had not at the earliest available opportunity raised the issue about the very existence or the role of 'Janah' in this episode, to enable adequate opportunity for the prosecution to undertake necessary investigations. Their cautioned statement were silent as to such a matter. This alleged or claimed omission by the recording officers was only raised at the closing stages of the prosecution's case in any event, namely, without any of the prosecution witnesses prior to SP11 being cross-examined on such alleged material information said to have given by A1 or A2 during investigations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> We therefore did not find any reasons to interfere with the finding of guilt made by the learned trial judge and the sentence imposed by the trial court against A1 and A2. A3</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The thrust of the appeal of A3 was however different and the grounds adduced before us were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> It was counsel for A3's argument that apart from the evidence of a prosecution witness that A3 had been seen to talk to A1 and A2 outside the Hotel, there was no other independent or credible evidence (by way of CCTV recordings perhaps) to show any contact or discussion between A3 on the one part, and A1 or A2 on the other part. Common intention or collaboration as between all accused charged was an essential ingredient and the mere evidence of one witness claiming that he had seen them talking with each other in the street was not also sufficient to implicate A3 to the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> More critically, it was urged upon us that even if the bag taken out of room 305 by A2 was P10 itself, there was no direct evidence that the concealed drugs found in P10 (subsequently when it was opened by the raiding party in room 409) was as a matter of fact in P10 itself when the bag left room 305. The possibility of the bag being tampered with in the interim or the drugs being planted therein after it had left room 305 could not be ruled out; there was therefore a serious gap in the prosecution case, the benefit of which should go to A3, it was argued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> It was also highlighted by counsel for A3 that the evidence showed that the police during investigations and identification of the clothing found in the bags had also made A3 to wear the long black pants for purposes of 'fitting' or identifying that clothing to be hers. It was suggested that in such circumstances, it was natural that the pants would contain some material or sample from which A3's DNA profile could be developed or deduced from. Since, the mixed DNA profile derived indicated another female source as well, it was definitely not safe to use this sole 'link' to implicate A3 with the contents of P10.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In our assessment, a material fact to be noted was that there was no drugs found in room 305, that is, the room which had been occupied by A3. Nor was there any other incriminating evidence found in that room or on the person of A3 to implicate her to the charge brought against her. The prosecution case to link A3 to the seised drugs was premised on the testimony that P10 was the bag seen to have been taken out of room 305 and also based on the discovery of the black pants belonging to A3 in P10.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> We found merit in the contention of counsel for A3 that there was no evidence that the bag P10 had remained completely intact between the time it left room 305 and when it was ripped open and the concealed drugs exposed by the raiding party in room 409 and the possibility that the bag could have been tampered with during that interim period to include the drugs within it could not be ruled out at all. There were also clothing belonging to A1 and/or A2 found in P10 when the raiding party opened that bag in room 409.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The remaining piece of evidence relied upon by the prosecution was the long black pants found in P10 bearing a mixed DNA profile belonging to two women, one of which profile was identified as being consistent or matching with the DNA profile of A3. In our view, since there was another DNA profile belonging to another unidentified female derived from the pants, such evidence could not amount to conclusive evidence that A3 was responsible for concealing the drugs in P10, much less that she had 'possession' of the same, in the physical sense, or that it could be reasonably inferred that she had 'knowledge' as to the concealed contraband drugs found in P10.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> In our view based on the matters discussed and elaborated above in paras 53, 54 and 55 of these grounds, the defence had cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case presented against A3. The conviction of A3 on the charge brought against A3 was therefore definitely not safe in the circumstances. Accordingly, we were constrained to set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on A3. We allowed A3's appeal and ordered that she be acquitted and discharged of the charge brought against her.</p>
