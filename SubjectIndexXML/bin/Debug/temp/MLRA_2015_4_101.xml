    <p>The respondent was an employee of the appellant company when he was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Agency ('ACA') for offences relating to corruption. He was subsequently released on bail. The appellant then suspended the respondent on the grounds of his arrest by the ACA. The appellant did not carry out any investigation for any misconduct, hold any domestic inquiry or issue any show cause letter. The appellant later terminated the services of the respondent. Subsequently, the respondent was charged in the Sessions Court for two offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_575;11.;;">s 11(a) of the Anti-Corruption Act 1997</LINK>. The Sessions judge acquitted the respondent after the close of the prosecution case. The prosecution was not successful in its appeal to the High Court and Court of Appeal. In the interim period, the respondent made a claim for wrongful dismissal, which went up to the Industrial Court. The Industrial Court found the respondent's termination to be justified and dismissed the respondent's claim. Aggrieved, the respondent applied to the High Court for judicial review. The learned judge found that the respondent's dismissal was unjustified due to the lack of a domestic inquiry; the termination being based merely on the respondent's arrest by the ACA; there being no investigation conducted by the appellant before the appellant's decision to dismiss the respondent; the respondent's acquittal by the Sessions Court, which decision was upheld by the High Court and the Court of Appeal; and the Sessions Court's finding that the witnesses against the respondent were not credible. The High Court issued a writ of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the Industrial Court award. Hence, the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was the statutory function of the Industrial Court to determine, firstly, whether the appellant was able to establish to the satisfaction of the Industrial Court the reason for the dismissal of the respondent; and secondly, whether such reason constituted sufficient cause for the dismissal. The Industrial Court had no jurisdiction to vitiate or nullify the dismissal merely because there was failure on the part of the employer to notify the employee of the nature of the alleged misconduct or to hold a domestic inquiry. It was not disputed that the respondent at the time of the dismissal was not informed of the nature of the alleged misconduct. It was also not disputed that no domestic inquiry was held. But the respondent had brought his claim for wrongful dismissal to the Industrial Court, and the Industrial Court, on its part, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction, had considered the evidence and the facts presented before it and had arrived at a finding that the appellant was able to establish a valid reason for the respondent's dismissal, ie that the respondent had over a span of time indulged in corrupt practices as explained by the Industrial Court in its award. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The Industrial Court had correctly stated the law that it was not bound by the findings of the Sessions Court, and that the proceedings in the Sessions Court was irrelevant to the Industrial Court proceedings. (para 41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The proceedings before the Sessions Court was criminal in nature and the applicable standard of proof was that of beyond reasonable doubt, ie different from that before the Industrial Court which was on a balance of probabilities. Moreover, the approach taken by the Industrial Court was consistent with the exercise of its function as prescribed by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">Industrial Relations Act 1967 ('Act')</LINK> in having to determine for itself, in accordance with its own legal standards as prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK>, whether the appellant had established a valid reason for the respondent's dismissal. Therefore, the Industrial Court correctly held that the proceedings in the Sessions Court were irrelevant to the present case. (para 42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The learned judge in criticising the approach taken by the Industrial Court had overlooked the fact that if the Industrial Court had considered itself bound by the findings of the Sessions Court or guided by those findings then it would have failed to discharge its function, ie making its own findings based on the evidence adduced before it and in compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK>. Whatever the findings of the Sessions Court, they could not, as a matter of law, be taken to be the parameters within which the Industrial Court was called upon to exercise its functions.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> We heard submissions on Tuesday 4 November 2014. We informed parties that we will deliver the judgment today (Friday 6 March 2015). We now do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We are allowing the appeal with costs. Our decision is unanimous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The Order of the High Court is set aside and the Award of the Industrial Court is restored.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In our judgment, the learned High Court Judge erred in law in allowing the respondent's application for judicial review to issue a writ of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the Award of the Industrial Court that was in favour of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondent, Mr Prabdhial Singh Dardara Singh, began his employment with the appellant, a company named Kempas Edible Oil Sdn Bhd, on 16 May 1994 as a Safety Officer. During his tenure of employment with the company he was frequently rewarded with bonus payments, and was thrice promoted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> However, in the year 2002 there was a complaint made to the appellant that the respondent had been demanding bribes. A business entity called 'Zulfida Enterprise' had entered into a contract with the appellant company to supply contract workers to the latter. What was alleged was that sometime in October 2002, the Factory Manager of the appellant, one Mohammad Mohan Kittu, received a letter dated 14 October 2002 from one Zulfakar bin Jema'at, the owner of Zulfida Enterprise that if he (Zulfakar) did not accord the respondent RM1,500.00 monthly, the appellant company would engage the services of another business entity for the supply of contract workers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondent was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) on 31 October 2002 in respect of offences pertaining to corruption, but was subsequently released on bail. On the same day itself (31 October 2002) the appellant was notified by an ACA Officer that the reason the respondent was arrested was due to the monthly RM1,500.00 payment required to be given to the respondent as a means of ensuring that other contractors were not engaged by the appellant to supply contract workers to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> By a letter dated 1 November 2002 the appellant suspended the respondent with full pay. The only reason given by the appellant for the suspension was merely the fact that he had been arrested by the ACA and that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The letter did not state what was the misconduct that the respondent was alleged to have committed. The letter of suspension reads.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> After the suspension, the appellant did not carry out any investigation against the respondent for any misconduct, nor was any domestic inquiry held. The respondent was not issued with any show cause letter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Then, on 6 January 2003, the respondent was issued with a termination letter. The letter states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It is to be observed that the above letter of termination is vague: it only mentioned 'recent misconduct'. The nature of the alleged 'recent misconduct' was not spelt out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> At the time of his dismissal, the respondent was the Assistant Human Resources Manager in the appellant. He was drawing a monthly salary of RM3,409.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Some eight months later, on 25 September 2003 the respondent was charged in the Sessions Court of Johor Bahru for two offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_575;11.;;">s 11(a) of the Anti-Corruption Act 1997</LINK>. The appellant was informed of this fact by the Anti-Corruption Agency by a letter issued to the appellant on the same date. Together with the letter, the appellant was also given copies of the charge sheet. The charges against the respondent are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The respondent claimed trial to the above charges. At the trial the main witnesses for the prosecution were Zulfakar and Mohammad Mohan Kittu. The latter was at the material time the respondent's immediate superior in the appellant company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On 11 January 2010, the learned Sessions Court Judge, at the close of the case for the prosecution, acquitted the respondent, ruling that the prosecution had failed to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against the respondent on the charges. In making the decision, the Sessions Court found that both Mohammad Mohan Kittu and Zulfakar were unworthy of credit and rejected their evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The prosecution appealed to the High Court but the appeal was dismissed. The prosecution then appeal to the Court of Appeal, but this was also dismissed. The decision of the Sessions Court was affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In the meantime, the respondent made a representation for wrongful dismissal to the Director General of Industrial Relations; and, thereafter, on 2 August 2004 the respondent's case was referred by the Minister of Human Resources to the Industrial Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20(3) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Hearing before the Industrial Court commenced on 11 February 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The Award - Award No 106 of 2013 - was handed down on 11 January 2013. The Industrial Court in its Award concluded that the appellant had proved on a balance of probabilities that the respondent's termination was justified and thus dismissed the respondent's claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Reasoning Of The Industrial Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The Industrial Court in its Award had alluded to the appellant's reasons for dismissing the respondent, as disclosed by the evidence before the court. It states in the Award:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In view of the above considerations, the management concluded that they could no longer repose the necessary trust and confidence in the claimant to carry out his duties and responsibilities in a faithful and diligent manner as there are more than reasonable grounds for the company to suspect that the claimant whilst discharging his duties as the Assistant Human Resources Manager was involved in corrupt practices. As a result, the company terminated the claimant's employment via letter dated 6 January 2003 with immediate effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The Industrial Court in its Award then made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The respondent, dissatisfied with the Award of the Industrial Court, applied to the High Court, by way of judicial review, for an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On 23<sup>rd</sup> January 2014 the High Court, having heard submissions of parties on the judicial review application, issued an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the Industrial Court's Award and declared that the dismissal of the respondent by the appellant was without just cause or excuse and the case be remitted to the Industrial Court to determine the appropriate relief to be given to the respondent by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The learned High Court Judge ruled that the Industrial Court had erred by failing to take into consideration relevant matters in arriving at its decision; the relevant matters being that the respondent's service was terminated without any domestic inquiry; that the termination of service was based merely on the fact of being arrested by the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA); that the appellant had failed to conduct any investigation before coming to a decision to dismiss the respondent; that the respondent had been acquitted by the Sessions Court, which decision had been upheld by the High Court and the Court of Appeal; and that the Sessions Court had found Zulfakar and Mohammad Mohan Kittu not to be credible witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court, the appellant filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal on 20 February 2014. Decision Of The Court</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In our judgment, the learned High Court Judge, with respect, erred in holding that the Industrial Court in arriving at its decision had failed to take into account relevant considerations as enumerated above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We have examined in detail the relevant passages in the Award of the Industrial Court, but with respect we find no basis for the High Court to quash the Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>On The Failure To Hold A Domestic Inquiry</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In our view, in the present case, we agree with the submission by the learned counsel for the appellant that the learned High Court Judge, with respect, in examining the procedural aspect of the decision making process adopted by the appellant (the employer) in arriving at the decision to terminate the employment of the respondent (employee) had departed from established principles of law as laid down in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_412;"><i>Wong Yuen Hock v. Syarikat Hong Leong Assurance Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 412</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 753; [1995] 3 CLJ 344; [1995] 2 AMR 2145 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1987_1_39;"><i>Dreamland Corp (M) Sdn Bhd v.

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is to be recalled that the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court is conferred by the Minister's reference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">Section 30(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK> provides that:</p>
    <p>(5) The court shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities and legal form.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The function of the Industrial Court when hearing such reference has been clearly explained by Raja Azlan Shah CJM (as he then was) in the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1981_1_415;"><i>Goon Kwee Phoy v. J&amp;P Coats (M) Bhd</i> [1981] 1 MLRA 415</LINK>; [1981] 2 MLJ 129. In this case cited, the learned Chief Judge (Malaya) said (at p 430):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> 14 years later Goon Kwee Phoy was cited with approval by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_412;"><i>Wong Yuen Hock v. Syarikat Hong Leong Assurance Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 412</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 753; [1995] 3 CLJ 344; [1995] 2 AMR 2145. In this case cited, Mohd Azmi FCJ having quoted Goon Kwee Phoy said (at p 419):</p>
    <p>On the authorities, we were of the view that the main and only function of the Industrial Court in dealing with a reference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the Act</LINK> (unless otherwise lawfully provided by the terms of the reference), is to determine whether the misconduct or irregularities complained of by the management as the grounds of dismissal were in fact committed by the workman, and if so, whether such grounds constitute just cause or excuse for the dismissal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> And subsequently in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_23;"><i>Milan Auto Sdn Bhd v. Wong Seh Yen</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 23</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 537; [1995] 4 CLJ 449; [1996] 1 AMR 049, the Federal Court likewise held (at p 26):</p>
    <p>As pointed out by this court recently in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_412;"><i>Wong Yuen Hock v. Syarikat Hong Leong Assurance Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 412</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 753; [1995] 3 CLJ 344; [1995] 2 AMR 2145, the function of the Industrial Court in dismissal cases on a reference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20</LINK> is two-fold, firstly, to determine whether the misconduct complained of by the employer has been established, and secondly whether the proven misconduct constitutes just cause or excuse for the dismissal. Failure to determine these issues on the merits would be a jurisdictional error which would merit interference by <i>certiorari</i> by the High Court. Further, the Industrial Court would be acting in excess of jurisdiction if it changed the scope of the reference by substituting its own reason, that is to say a reason not relied upon by the employer for the dismissal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In <i>Wong Yuen Hock</i> the brief facts were that it was an unwritten rule of the company (Hong Leong Assurance Sdn Bhd), an insurance company, that staff are prohibited from purchasing wrecks. Rumours were floating around that the claimant in that case, Wong Yuen Hock, who was the Insurance Manager of the company at the material time, had purchased the wreck of a luxurious Mercedes Benz insured with the company without the knowledge of the company. The claimant was sacked without eliciting an explanation from him or affording him the right to be heard in a domestic inquiry, this being one of the terms and conditions of his contract of employment. On the issue regarding the failure on the part of the employer to hold a domestic inquiry, Mohd Azmi FCJ, at a later part of the judgment in <i>Wong Yuen Hock</i>, added (at p 424):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Reverting to the present case, on the authorities, we hold that it was the statutory function of the Industrial Court to determine, firstly, whether the appellant was able to establish to the satisfaction of the Industrial Court the reason for the dismissal of the respondent; and, secondly, whether such reason constituted sufficient cause for the dismissal. The Industrial Court had no jurisdiction to vitiate or nullify the dismissal merely because there was failure on the part of the employer to notify the employee the nature of the alleged misconduct or to hold a domestic inquiry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In the present case, it is not disputed that the respondent at the time of the dismissal was not informed of the nature of the alleged misconduct. It is also not disputed that no domestic inquiry was held. But the respondent had brought his claim for wrongful dismissal to the Industrial Court. And the Industrial Court on its part, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction, had considered the evidence and the facts presented before it and had arrived at a finding that the appellant was able to establish a valid reason for the respondent's dismissal: that the respondent had over a span of time indulged in corrupt practices that involved Zulfakar and the appellant's business dealing with Zulfida Enterprise, as explained by the Industrial Court in its Award.</p>

      <b>The Relevance Of The Sessions Court Proceedings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Another reason for the learned High Court Judge to quash the Award of the Industrial Court was the failure on the part of the Industrial Court to take into consideration the fact that the Sessions Court had acquitted the respondent on the two charges of corruption and the findings of the learned Sessions Court Judge that Zulfakar and Mohammad Mohan Kittu were not credible witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Before the Industrial Court, as well as before us, the respondent took the position that in view of the fact that the Sessions Court (upheld by the High Court and the Court of Appeal) had acquitted the respondent and had made a finding that Zulfakar and Mohammad Mohan Kittu were not credible witnesses, the Industrial Court ought to be bound, if not guided, by those findings and should refrain from arriving at any contrary findings on those same issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We reproduce below the submission of the respondent's counsel submitted before the Industrial Court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In our judgment, we agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the Industrial Court had correctly stated the law that (1) it was not bound by the findings of the Sessions Court, and that (2) the proceedings in the Sessions Court was irrelevant to the Industrial Court proceedings. Indeed this is the approach adopted in the following Industrial Court cases:</p>
    <p>(1) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1983_1_166;"><i>Malaysian Airline System Bhd v. Airline Workers' Union, Sarawak</i> [1983] 1 MELR 166</LINK>; [1983] 1 ILR 238; and</p>
    <p>(2) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1994_2_590;"><i>Taiko Plantations Sdn Berhad, Negeri Sembilan v. Ragawan Raman Nair &amp; Anor</i> [1994] 2 MELR 590</LINK>; [1994] 2 ILR 75.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The proceedings before the Sessions Court are criminal in nature and the applicable standard of proof is that of beyond reasonable doubt, that is to say, different from that before the Industrial Court which is on a balance of probabilities. Moreover, it is our view that the approach taken by the Industrial Court is consistent with the exercise of its function as prescribed by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK> in having to determine for itself, in accordance with its own legal standards as prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK>, whether the appellant had established a valid reason for the respondent's dismissal. We, therefore, hold that the Industrial Court correctly held that (to quote the relevant passage in the Award):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The learned High Court Judge, however, found this approach as adopted by the Industrial Court as being unacceptable. With respect, it is our view that the learned High Court Judge in criticising this approach had overlooked the fact that if the Industrial Court had considered itself bound by the findings of the Sessions Court or guided by those findings then it would have failed to discharge its function, that is, making its own findings based on the evidence adduced before it and in compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5)</LINK>. Whatever were the findings of the Sessions Court, they could not, as a matter of law, be taken to be the parameters within which the Industrial Court is called upon to exercise its functions.</p>
