    <p>The present appeal concerned the quantum of damages in respect of a claim by the plaintiff, acting as an assignee of Marinehub Sdn Bhd ("Marinehub"), against the defendant for breach of a fixed price bunker contract for the sale of Marine Fuel Oil ("MFO"). The High Court had earlier established the liability of the defendant for breach of contract. The Court of Appeal had dismissed its appeal and the defendant had been denied leave to appeal to the Federal Court. By a separate hearing of assessment of damages for breach of contract, the High Court had awarded the plaintiff a total of USD25,246,233.17. On appeal by the defendant against the assessment of damages, the Court of Appeal reduced the quantum awarded by the High Court to a sum of USD177,410.90. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court on the following four questions of law: (i) whether the conflict of laws principle pronounced in <i>JD'Almeida Araujo Lda v. Sir Frederick Becker &amp; Co Ld</i> and <i>Boys v. Chaplin</i> as applied in <i>Chan Kwon Fong &amp; Anor v. Chan Wah</i> and in <i>Eikobina (M) Sdn Bhd v. Mensa Mercantile (Far East) Pte Ltd</i> represents good law in Malaysia, and was correctly applied by the High Court; and if so whether the Court of Appeal was entitled to reverse it and/or not apply it; (ii) in a case where there is an available market for the goods, whether the law on the assessment of damages for non-acceptance of goods pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;56.;;">ss 56</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;61.;;">61 of the Sale of Goods Act 1957 ("SOGA 1957")</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74 of the Contracts Act 1950 ("CA 1950")</LINK> is the same or arrives at the same conclusion, as the corresponding provisions under ss 50 and 54 of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 as was found by the High Court, and if so, whether the Court of Appeal was entitled to reverse it and/or not apply it; (iii) whether the principle of law that loss of profit and liability of the innocent party to a third party under a third party contract are inseparable two-fold limbs recoverable together as special damages, represents good law in Malaysia, and if so, whether the deci6sion of the Court of Appeal ought to be set aside/wholly reversed; and (iv) whether the principle of law in <i>Total Liban SA v. Vitol Energy SA</i> is good law in Malaysia, in determining that the liability to a third party need not first have to be paid by the innocent party for it to be recoverable from the party in breach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal in part; setting aside quantum of damages awarded by Court of Appeal; restoring quantum of damages awarded by High Court):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The basic general principle is that, in accordance with the principles of conflict of laws, in an action for damages for breach of contract governed by foreign law, the measure of damages or quantification of damage should be according to the <i>lex fori</i>, ie Malaysian law, even if the proper law of contract is agreed to be foreign law. Applying this principle, determining that the plaintiff was entitled to general damages and not special damages would be considered to be questions of substance and hence, governed by the lex causae, ie the English law being the law of contract. On the other hand, determining the actual amount of general damages is a matter of quantification or the measure of the general damages that the plaintiff is entitled to would be considered procedural matters governed by the <i>lex fori</i>, ie Malaysian law. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The Court of Appeal rightly took the approach that in accordance with the principles of conflict of laws, the measure of damages or quantification should be according to the <i>lex fori</i>, ie Malaysian law, even if the proper law of contract was agreed to be foreign law. The High Court erred when it concluded that the issue before the court was one of remoteness of damages and thus a matter of substantive right. The issue in this case was not one of remoteness but the measure of damages. The plaintiff had specifically elected to claim either general damages or, in the alternative, special damages. General damages are given in respect of such damage as the law presumes to result from the infringement of a legal right and duty: damages must be proved but the claimant cannot quantify exactly any particular items in it. Therefore, the quantification of general damages ought to be according to the Malaysian law, the <i>lex fori</i>. The Court of Appeal did not reverse the conflict of laws principle enunciated in the cases referred in question (i). (paras 38-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Section 50(1) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 is identical to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;56.;;">s 56 of the Malaysian SOGA 1957</LINK> which confers the right on a seller to sue a buyer for damages, where there is non-acceptance of the goods contracted for. However, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;;">SOGA 1957</LINK> does not provide how damages thereunder are to be assessed or quantified as it does not provide the equivalent of subsections 50(2) and (3) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, this is provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Malaysian CA 1950</LINK>. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1)</LINK>, the party may recover any loss or damage which naturally arises in the usual course of things; or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from a breach of the contract. (paras 46-48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Even though there is no corresponding subsection 3 of s 50 of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979, Malaysian courts have applied the market price differential by way of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Malaysian CA 1950</LINK> to measure recoverable damages. (para 49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> On authority and on principle, there is no difference between English law and Malaysian law on the assessment of recoverable damages. When there is an available market, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the CA 1950</LINK>, the loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events is the market price differential. Thus, the defendant's liability was for the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time and place fixed by the contract for the acceptance of the MFO. (para 54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's judgment, and found loss of profits, computed against a third party contract. This was plainly wrong. The Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that loss of profit was special damages, not general damages. (para 55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> As assignee of the contract, the plaintiff's damages against the defendant for non-acceptance of the MFO were general damages, namely the difference between the contract price and the market price over the period it would take any reasonable supplier to dispose of the unlifted quantities of MFO. The measure of damages was the loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of event, from the defendant's non-acceptance of the delivery of the MFO and for wrongful termination of the contract. The law would assess Marinehub's damages as if it had gone into the market and re-sold the goods. Damages would be calculated on the assumption that Marinehub acted reasonably to mitigate its loss by going into the market to re-sell the MFO. (para 62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> There was no error in the judgment of the High Court. Question (ii) was therefore to be answered in the affirmative. The Court of Appeal was not entitled to reverse the settled principle that general damages in the form of market price differential was recoverable by an innocent seller upon breach of contract by the buyer. In light of the findings and in the circumstances of this case, it was unnecessary for the court to answer questions (iii) and (iv). (paras 63-65)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Azahar Mohamed FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by Scandinavian Bunkering (Singapore) Pte Ltd (the plaintiff in the High Court) against the quantum of damages awarded by the Court of Appeal. The damages awarded were in respect of a claim by the plaintiff against the respondent, MISC Berhad (the defendant in the High Court) for breach of contract of a sale of fixed quantities Marine Fuel Oil ("MFO") also referred to as fixed price bunker supply agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We will describe the parties in this judgment as they appear in the High Court, namely the appellant as the plaintiff and the respondent as the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It has to be highlighted at this point that the liability of the defendant to the plaintiff for breach of contract had been previously established following the summary judgment of the High Court dated 23 September 2009 pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14.;;">O 14 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> and the dismissal of the defendant's appeal from that judgment by the Court of Appeal on 6 July 2010. On the liability issue, it was determined that the defendant had no triable issues that should go for trial. The defendant had been held liable to pay damages to the plaintiff for breach of contract for its failure to take delivery of the MFO and for wrongful repudiation of the contract of a sale of fixed quantities MFO agreements, with damages to be assessed. The defendant was denied leave to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal by the Federal Court on 6 October 2010.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> By a separate hearing for assessment of damages for breach of contract, the High Court on 16 May 2011 awarded the plaintiff a total sum of USD25,246,233.17. On appeal against the said quantum of damages awarded, the Court of Appeal on 18 December 2012 reduced the quantum awarded by the High Court to a total sum of USD177,410.90.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff applied for leave to appeal to the Federal Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> and on 16 January 2014, this court granted leave to appeal to the plaintiff on four questions of law. Hence, the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The plaintiff is a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Singapore, carrying on the business of trade and transportation of petroleum and other liquid products. The defendant is a public listed company incorporated under the laws of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 16 September 2008, the defendant entered into a fixed price bunker contract ("the contract") with Marinehub Sdn Bhd ("Marinehub") whereby the defendant purchased and agreed to accept delivery of 102,600mt, +/- 5%, of MFO 380 cst over a fixed period of three months beginning 1 October 2008 until 31 December 2008, on the basis of 34,200 metric tons per month, at a fixed price of USD559.80 per mt, evidenced, among others, by the Letter of Award dated 16 September 2008 issued by the defendant to Marinehub. Delivery of the MFO was to be at Singapore to satisfy the defendant's fleet requirements. The total contract value was USD57,435,480.00. The contract was governed by English law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The defendant essentially wanted Marinehub to lock in the price of MFO over three months. In the early part of 2008, the price of MFO was rising rapidly. As ship owners, the defendant wanted certainty in their bottom line costs of MFO, and so entered into the contract to lock the defendant's costs of purchase of its required amount of MFO to a fixed price.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At the same time, and back-to-back with the contract, Marinehub to the full knowledge of the defendant, entered into a fixed price bunker contract with the plaintiff ("the SBS FPC") whereby Marinehub purchased the same quantity of 102,600mt, +/- 5% of MFO, at a fixed price of USD557.50 per mt, for the same fixed period from 1 October 2008 to 31 December 2008, for delivery to the defendant's ships. This is an important point that should be kept in mind.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> As it turned out, 2008 was a year of extreme volatility in the trading of MFO. The prices were surging upwards to unprecedented levels on or before October 2008. Then, October, November and December 2008 saw a rapid decline in prices for MFO in response to the global financial crisis. The contract, as events unfolded, was part performed by the defendant, with the defendant taking delivery eighteen parcels amounting to only 20,334.59mt of MFO during October 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The dispute in the present case arose as soon as the defendant refused to take further delivery of the remaining quantity for October 2008 and took no delivery of the contracted quantities of MFO for November and December 2008. The defendant instead purchased MFO on the spot basis at substantially reduced prices, making a savings in excess of USD20 million. Spot basis refers to the purchase of MFO at the prevailing market price.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> By email dated 14 November 2008 and sent to Marinehub, the defendant stated that "... we will terminate our Letter of Award dated 16 September 2008 pursuant to cl 2.2 of the same". This was accepted either before or the latest on 1 December 2008 as bringing the contract to an end.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In the meantime, Marinehub did not take delivery of the MFO from the plaintiff, and the plaintiff disposed of it on the spot market at much lower prices than had been purchased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> When it became clear that Marinehub was having difficulties with the defendant under the contract, with direct consequences on the SBS FPC, the plaintiff took an assignment of Marinehub's rights and interests in and under the contract to enable the plaintiff to deal directly with the defendant. The plaintiff and Marinehub entered into an assignment agreement on 12 November 2008 ("the Assignment Agreement"). Clause 2.1 of the Assignment Agreement provides in relevant part is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Notice in writing of the Assignment Agreement was given to the defendant on 13 November 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Acting as assignee under the Assignment Agreement, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant by filing a writ of summons and statement of claim on 3 February 2009. The plaintiff 's claim was for breach of contract by the defendant for non-acceptance of delivery of 82,265mt of MFO and wrongful termination of the contract dated 16 September 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In its amended statement of claim, the plaintiff as assignee of Marinehub's rights under the contract, in the main, framed its claim in the alternative, as either:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Proceedings At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> After a trial over three days, with six witnesses (including two expert witnesses called by the plaintiff) and having heard submissions from both parties, the learned Judicial Commissioner ("JC") found at the conclusion of the proceedings for assessment of damages, that the plaintiff had established its claim for damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned JC held that under the applicable principle of conflict of laws, the applicable law as to remoteness of damages was English law, ie the governing law of the contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The learned JC held that the plaintiff was entitled to general damages. Following this finding, the learned JC then proceeded to assess the quantum of general damages awarded to the plaintiff by taking the difference between the contract price and the market price of the MFO, ie the market price differential was applied. The application of the market price differential was done by reference to the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 and in particular, s 50(3) thereof.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Further, the learned JC found that Malaysian law on the relevant damages recoverable for non-acceptance of goods would arrive at the same conclusion as English law by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;56.;;">s 56 of the Malaysian Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. Relying on, among others, the judgments in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_394;"><i>Malaysian Rubber Development Corporation Berhad v. Glove Seal Sdn Bhd</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 394</LINK>; [1994] 3 MLJ 569; [1994] 4 CLJ 783; [1994] 3 AMR 2407 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1962_1_125;"><i>Lee Heng &amp; Co v.

    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The learned JC therefore accepted the plaintiff 's primary claim framed in general damages as per para 11 of the amended statement of claim, and ordered the defendant to pay damages in the sum of USD25,246,233.17, the currency of the contract being US Dollars. In assessing damages, the learned JC made findings of fact as to the quantities not taken up by the respondent, ie 77,135.174mt, the relevant periods and the average market as follows:</p>

      <b>Proceedings At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The core issue before the Court of Appeal was that the quantum of damages awarded by the High Court as general damages was in error. This issue was addressed by reference to the law applicable for assessment of damages and the actual quantum of damages assessed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Essentially the Court of Appeal held that the issue of quantification of damages should be in accordance with the <i>lex fori</i>, ie Malaysian law and that under Malaysian law, the measure of damages is determined by reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;56.;;">s 56 of the Malaysian Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK> does not provide any measure of damages. The Court of Appeal took the view that what naturally arose from the defendant's breach was Marinehub's loss of what it would have made, ie loss of profits, had the contract been performed; and that Marinehub's loss would be a sum of USD177,410.90 being the amount that Marinehub would have made, had the contract been performed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the result, the Court of Appeal allowed the defendant's appeal and the damages awarded to the plaintiff was reduced from USD25,246,233.17 to USD177,410.90 based on the quantity of the MFO that the learned JC found which was not taken up/bought by the defendant.</p>

      <b>The Questions Of Law On Appeal To The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As mentioned earlier, this court granted leave to the plaintiff to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the following four questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> From the above, it can be seen that the leave questions relate to the law applicable to the assessment of damages in the context of an express choice of law clause and the correct head(s) of damages to be awarded to an innocent seller for the wrongful refusal by a buyer to accept delivery of goods.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We will deal first with Question 1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Question 1 raises for the most part the basic issue of whether English law or Malaysian law should apply for the assessment of damages in this case. It is not disputed that the proper law of the contract is English Law. On that, there is no doubt because cl 13 of the contract states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On this issue, the submissions of learned counsel for the plaintiff can be summarized as follows. The contract contained an express choice of law clause, cl 13, which provided for English law. This express choice of law clause governed the head(s) of damages, or type of loss based on remoteness, recoverable by the plaintiff from the defendant for breach of the contract. In this instance, the head(s) of damages under contemplation were either: market price differential, as general damages; or loss of profits plus an indemnity for Marinehub's liability to the plaintiff, both assessed with reference to a third party contract (being the SBS FPC), as special damages. As to which of these head(s) of damages is recoverable is to be determined by English law as the substantive law of the contract. The actual quantification or amount of monies recoverable under the appropriate head(s) of damages, based on rules of evidence and procedural, is then determined by Malaysian law as the law of the forum, <i>lex fori</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On the other hand, learned counsel for the defendant contended that the High Court should have applied Malaysian law, instead of the proper law of the contract (English law), when assessing or quantifying the measure of damages to be awarded to the defendant. It was his submissions that the applicable principle of private international law (conflicts of law) was that while the parties might elect a foreign law as the proper law of the contract (the lex causae), it was the law of the forum (the <i>lex fori</i>) that was to be applied for the purposes of determining the measure of damages and quantification of the damages to be awarded. According to learned counsel, the <i>lex fori</i> in this case was Malaysian law as the proceedings were brought in the High Court of Malaya.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32</b>] On the conflict of law issue, the distinction that is drawn between the applicable law of contract and the applicable law for the purposes of the forum's assessment of damages can be found in the following authorities. A synopsis of the applicable law is set out in <i>Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws</i>, vol 2, 14th edn, 2006, at p 192 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The applicable law as stated in <i>Cheshire, North &amp; Fawcett, Private International Law</i>, 14th edn p 98 is set out as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In <i>J D'Almeida Araujo Lda v. Sir Frederick Becker &amp; Co Ld (supra)</i>, the plaintiffs entered into a contract, the proper law of which was Portuguese, to sell 500 tons of palm-oil to the defendants. As a result of a breach by the defendants, the plaintiffs committed a breach of a contract with a third party for which they were liable to pay the third party an indemnity. In an action by the plaintiffs for damages for breach of contract, it was held that the question whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the indemnity from the defendants was a question of remoteness of damage to be decided according to Portuguese law. Pilcher J after considering the authorities and literature observed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In <i>Boys v. Chaplin</i> [1971] AC 356, Lord Hodson stated that:</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The basic general principle that can be gleaned from the above authorities is that in accordance with the principles of conflicts of laws, in an action for damages for breach of contract governed by foreign law, the measure of damages or quantification of damage, should be according to the <i>lex fori</i>, ie Malaysian law, even if the proper law of a contract is agreed to be foreign law. Applying this principle, in our judgment, determining that the plaintiff was entitled to general damages and not special damages would be considered to be questions of substance and hence governed by the lex causae, ie the English law being the law of the contract. On the other hand, determining the actual "amount" of general damages is a matter of "quantification" or the "measure" of the general damages that the plaintiff is entitled to would be considered to be procedural matters governed by the <i>lex fori</i>, ie Malaysian law. In this regard, the Court of Appeal made an important observation, which we respectfully agree, and reproduced as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In our judgment, the Court of Appeal rightly took the approach that in accordance with the principles of conflict of laws, the measure of damages or quantification should be according to the <i>lex fori</i>, ie Malaysian law, even if the proper law of a contract is agreed to be foreign law. In this respect, the learned JC erred in equating "remoteness" of damages with "measure'' of damages or "quantification" of damages. The learned JC erred when she concluded that the issue before the court was one of "remoteness" of damages and thus a matter of substantive right. The issue in this case was not one of "remoteness" but the "measure of damages". As observed by the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff had specifically elected to claim either general damages pursuant to para 11 of the amended statement of claim; or, in the alternative, special damages pursuant to para 14 of the amended statement of claim. The learned JC awarded general damages. It was not the defendant's contention that the plaintiff was not entitled to general damages because they were too remote. What was disputed was the quantum of the general damages that was awarded. General damages are given in respect of such damage as the law presumes to result from the infringement of a legal right and duty: damages must be proved but the claimant cannot quantify exactly any particular items in it [see <i>Chitty on Contracts, General Principles</i> (30th edn) para 26-006]. Having determined that the plaintiff was entitled to general damages, the learned JC should have applied Malaysian law in quantifying the measure of damages to be awarded. This was not a question of "remoteness" of damages. It was a determination of the amount of damages (quantum), thus the "measure of damages", to be awarded and not whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages (remoteness). Indeed, the proceeding before the learned JC was for the assessment of damages, ie the determination of the measure and quantum of damages that the plaintiff was entitled to. Therefore, in our judgment, the quantification of general damages ought to be according to Malaysian law, the <i>lex fori</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In consequence, our answer to Question 1 is as follows: The Court of Appeal did not reverse the conflict of laws principle enunciated in the cases referred to in the question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We now turn to consider Question 2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In essence, learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that irrespective of whether Malaysian law or English law was the law applicable to the assessment of recoverable damages, the end result would be the same. He submitted that it was plainly wrong for the Court of Appeal to find Malaysian law in this regard to be different from English law and to reduce the quantum of damages awarded by the High Court by 99.3%, from USD25,246,233.17 to USD177.410 September The principal thrust of learned counsel's contention was that the proper damages recoverable under both systems of common law, where there was an available market for the goods, was the market differential in price as general damages, as correctly found by the High Court. He also put forward a submission that ss 50 and 54 of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;56.;;">ss 56</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;61.;;">61 of the Malaysian Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74 of the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, are statutory recitations of the common law rule established by the Court in the well-known case of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i> [1859] 9 Ex 341; where there is an available market, the loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events is the market price differential under the first limb of <i>Hadley v. Baxendale (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In refuting the contention of the plaintiff, learned counsel for the defendant took the position that even if the law on assessment of damages for non- acceptance of goods pursuant to English law and Malaysian law may arrive at the same conclusion, the issue was whether the market price differential applied by the learned JC was applicable, or should be applied, in this case. Learned counsel submitted that the market price differential, which was merely a <i>prima facie</i> rule under s 50(3) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979, was not applicable in this case because it would result in a consequence contrary to principles of damages in contract law. In the result, he submitted that would put the plaintiff as assignee of the seller, Marinehub (assignor), in a position better than had the contract been performed without any breach - better by 14,230% more (or 142.3 times more) than what the assignor Marinehub would have made had the contract been performed without breach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The most important purpose of damages is to enable the innocent party to receive monetary compensation from the party at fault for the breach of contract. In this regard, as a starting point, we refer to the classic statement on this aspect of the law by Alderson B in <i>Hadley v. Baxendale (supra)</i> which has been well summarized in <i>Halsbury's Laws of Malaysia</i> 2002 vol 14 p 20 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Under English law, the assessment for a breach of contract for the sale of goods is governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The English law applicable to assessment of damages where a buyer is in default starts with s 50(1) the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 which confers the right on a seller to maintain an action for damages for non-acceptance of goods by the buyer. Section 50(2) provides the measure of damages for a claim under s 50(1) and it provides that the measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the buyer's breach of contract. This is essentially a statutory enunciation of the first limb of the rule in <i>Hadley v. Baxendale (supra)</i>. Of greater relevance is s 50(3), which provides the market price differential as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Section 50(3) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 sets out the applicable general rule under English law where there is an "available market for the goods in question". If there is an "available market" and a buyer wrongly fails to accept the goods the seller's damages are calculated by deducting the contract price from the market price at the time and place fixed by the contract for acceptance (see <i>Metelmann v. NBR</i> [1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep 614 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_14_744;"><i>Aercap Partners 1 Ltd v. Avia Asset Management</i> [2010] 14 MLRH 744</LINK>; [2010] EWHC 2431 and Chittty on Contracts, Specific Contracts (30th edn) vol 2, Chapter 43).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> It is pertinent to note that s 50(1) the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 is identical to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;56.;;">s 56 of the Malaysian Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK> which confers the right on a seller to sue a buyer for damages, where there is non-acceptance of the goods contracted for. However, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;;">Malaysian Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK> does not provide how damages thereunder are to be assessed or quantified as it does not provide the equivalent of subsections 50(2) and (3) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979. This is in its place provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950</LINK> as follows:</p>

      <b>[48]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, the party may recover any loss or damage which naturally arises in the usual course of things; or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from a breach of the contract. This provision is the statutory enunciation of the rule in <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i> (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1967_1_196;"><i>Toeh Kee Keong v. Tambun Mining Company Ltd</i> [1967] 1 MLRA 196</LINK>; [1968] 1 MLJ 39, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1980_1_474;"><i>Tan Chin Kim Sawmill And Factory Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v.

    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Even though there is no corresponding subsection (3) of s 50 of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979, our courts have applied the market price differential by way of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950</LINK> to measure recoverable damages. This was shown in a number of cases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> First, the case of <i>Lee Heng &amp; Co v. C Melchers &amp; Co (supra)</i>, where in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Thomson CJ said:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> And thirdly, we would draw attention to the Supreme Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_146;"><i>Eikobina (M) Sdn Bhd v. Mensa Mercantile (Far East) Pte Ltd</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 146</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 553; [1994] 2 CLJ 6; [1994] 1 AMR 529, where Peh Swee Chin SCJ said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The position under Malaysian law that the market price differential applies to measure the recoverable damages where there is an available market for breach of a contract for the sale of goods is well-summarized in <i>Halsbury's Laws of Malaysia</i> 2004 vol 24 p 414 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> We adopt the principles as enunciated by the abovementioned cases that where there is an available market on the goods, general damages in the form of market price differential is recoverable by an innocent seller upon breach of contract on sale of goods by the buyer. Accordingly, on authority as well as on principle, there is no difference between English law and Malaysian law on the assessment of recoverable damages. When there is an available market, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74(1) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, the loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events is the market price differential. Thus, the defendant's liability was for the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time and place fixed by the contract for acceptance of the MFO. The Court of Appeal in this regard was therefore plainly wrong in failing to recognize that in a case where there was an available market for the goods, the law on the assessment of damages for non-acceptance of goods pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;56.;;">s 56 of the Malaysian Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74 of the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950</LINK> was the same or arrived at the same conclusion, as the corresponding provisions under s 50 of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The Court of Appeal, without reference to any of the aforesaid case law on market price differential, reversed the High Court's judgment, and found loss of profits, computed against a third party contract. This was plainly wrong. With all due respect, the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that loss of profit was special damages, not general damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> On the specific point raised by learned counsel for the defendant to the effect that the market price differential would put the plaintiff as assignee in a position better than what the assignor Marinehub would have made had the contract been performed without breach, it is important to appreciate the complexity and magnitude of international bunker trading. Bernard Khoo Kah Choon ("PW3") has been working in the international bunker industry for almost 25 years. He explained the workings of international bunker trading as follows. Bunker trading and supplying can involve as few as two parties, ie supplier and owner of the vessel which requires bunkers, to several parties being involved in a string of contracts, especially if the ultimate buyer is a foreign party. The source bunker trading company will contract with a locally established bunker trader or supplier because it has done due diligence on that company and has permitted a credit-line for it. The trader/supplier in turn might source potential customers through his foreign office or through others such as a broker. The terms of each of the contracts as to the quantity and quality of the bunker sold and purchased are often identical, though the price and payment terms may vary. As a result of a breach by the end party to take delivery of the bunker, all intermediary parties will decline to take delivery of the bunker. This sets in motion a chain reaction, creating a domino effect on the parties down the string of contracts. The party who has ownership of the bunker is often left with the task of having to dispose of the bunker in the market, and claiming the loss from its immediate buyer. There will then be a series of claims that would work itself up the chain to the end purchaser, who wrongfully refused to accept delivery of the bunker.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> It was against the above backdrop that the contract provided for a total of 102.600mt +/- 5% of MFO to be delivered to the defendant in instalments of 34,200mt in October, November and December 2008. There were no fixed delivery dates within those months. Instead, consistent with the nature of the goods and their intended use as MFO for the defendant's ships, the contract envisaged that a number of separate relatively small deliveries would be made to ships throughout the course of each month. In order to supply the defendant under the contract, Marinehub had a contract to buy the MFO from the plaintiff. Marinehub therefore sought to obtain MFO to be delivered pursuant to the contract from the plaintiff on a back to back basis. The plaintiff was thus the supplier of MFO to Marinehub for Marinehub to onward supply the defendant under the contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In this regard, the managing director of Marinehub, Dr Hj Zainal Abdul Wahab ("PW1") testified that the defendant was well aware of the plaintiff 's involvement in the supply and delivery of the MFO under the contract and that the plaintiff in turn had an arrangement for the physical delivery of MFO with Northwest, to the knowledge of Marinehub and the defendant. According to PW1, the defendant knew of these arrangements from previous transactions with Marinehub where the plaintiff was the principal and Northwest was the physical supplier. In his testimony, PW1 explained the consequence of the failure on the part of the defendant to take delivery the MFO in question:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> It is not disputed that there was an available market to dispose of the MFO in October, November and December 2008. In this regard, the learned JC noted that the court needed to consider the appropriate time at which the market for 77,135.174mt of MFO was established as being available, to ascertain the proper price to be accepted as the market price in this instance, in computing the sum of money payable in damages. The learned JC made a finding that the evidence of PW3 was clear that in a declining market such as that in November and December 2008, 77,135.174mt of MFO could not be disposed of in one lot and that buyers and traders were cautious to see if the price would decline further. The learned JC accepted that it would have taken a period of time to dispose of the 77,135.174mt of unlifted MFO by the defendant in the Singapore market, ie one week for the October quantities, and two to three weeks each for the November and December quantities. The corresponding period established the available market. Furthermore, of the two published market rates, the learned JC found that the Platts Bunkenwire Index was the more appropriate index to use to ascertain the market price of the MFO for the relevant period. The learned JC then found that the differential in the market price published by Platts Bunkerwire and the contract price for the unlifted quantities (less -5%) gave rise to a recoverable loss of USD25,246,233.17. This was the plaintiff 's loss as Marinehub's assignee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> It is relevant to note that the defendant admitted through DW1, that it made a saving in excess of USD20 million by its breach of the contract, in the falling MFO market in November and December 2008. This USD20 million savings by the defendant corresponded to the market loss sustained by the plaintiff/Marinehub as the innocent sellers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In <i>Westbrook Resources Ltd v. Gobe Metallurgical Inc</i> [2007] EWHC 2353 (Comm), the English Commercial Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> As stated earlier, as assignee of the contract, the plaintiff 's damages against the defendant for non-acceptance of the MFO were general damages, namely the difference between the contract price and the market price over the period it would take any reasonable supplier to dispose of the unlifted quantities of MFO. This measure of damages, in our judgment, was the loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the defendant's non-acceptance of the delivery of the MFO and for wrongful termination of the contract. In this case, the defendant had full knowledge from the very beginning that Marinehub had entered into a back-to-back SBS FPC with the plaintiff to ensure the supply of MFO to the defendant's ships under the contract. This point has already been made earlier on but deserved to be reiterated. Once the defendant breached the contract, which sets into motion chain reaction. In the context of the present case, it did not matter that Marinehub did not purchase the MFO from the plaintiff, nor that it did not in fact sell the MFO to alternative buyers after the contract was broken. The law assesses Marinehub's damages as if it had gone into the market and re-sold the goods. Damages are calculated on the assumption that Marinehub acted reasonably to mitigate its loss by going into the market to re-sell the MFO. This is to restrict the losses of an innocent seller, such as Marinehub.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In our judgment, there was no error in the judgment of the learned JC. The learned JC had thoroughly analyzed the relevant leading cases on each issue, considered the evidence tendered in detail, and applied correctly the relevant law to the facts of this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> In consequence, our answer to Question 2 is in the affirmative and that the Court of Appeal was not entitled to reverse the settled principle that general damages in the form of market price differential is recoverable by an innocent seller upon breach of contract by the buyer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> In light of our findings and in the circumstances of this case, it is unnecessary for us to answer Questions 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Despite the error by the learned JC in holding that the English law applied in considering the remedy (the general damages) available to the plaintiff in view of the governing law of the contract, the final sum of general damages payable as determined is correct. This is because, as we have stated earlier, the actual effect of the relevant provisions of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 is the same upon the application of the relevant sections under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;;">Malaysian Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;;">Malaysian Contracts Act 1950</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> We accordingly allow this appeal in part by setting aside the quantum of damages awarded by the Court of Appeal, and we hereby restore the quantum of damages awarded by the High Court in the total sum of USD25,246,233.17. We order the defendant to pay costs of this appeal to the plaintiff. We further order the deposit to be refunded to the plaintiff.</p>
