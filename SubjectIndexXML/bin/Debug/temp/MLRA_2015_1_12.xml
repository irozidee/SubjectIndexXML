    <p>The respondent/plaintiff had brought a claim against the appellants/defendants for damages in failing to, amongst others, provide accurate information pertaining to a motorcar the respondent had purchased from another registered owner, as the motorcar was later seized by the police on suspicion that it was a stolen motorcar. Prior to the purchase, the respondent had checked with the register kept by the 1st appellant, which showed no impediments to the transfer of the motorcar to him. The High Court and the Court of Appeal found for the respondent, which gave rise to the appeal herein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">Sections 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12 of the Road Transport Act 1987 ('the Act')</LINK>, on the requirement to inspect the motor vehicle, only applied to the registration of a motor vehicle and not to the change of possession (the registration of a new owner of motor vehicle like in the present case). The wordings of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12</LINK> were very clear and unambiguous in that they only dealt with the registration of motor vehicles. They did not deal with the change of possession of motor vehicles. It was only <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13</LINK> that applied to change of possession of a motor vehicle as what had happened in the present case. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was no requirement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13 of the Act</LINK> for the Director of Road Transport ('Director') to inspect the motor vehicle before the registration of a new owner of the motor vehicle. The 1st appellant did not breach his duty under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13</LINK> when he registered the respondent as the new registered owner of the motorcar without first inspecting the motorcar. The Federal Court decision in <i>Ketua Polis Negeri Sembilan &amp; Anor v. Manoharan Dorasamy</i> did not apply to vehicles whose registrations were transferred pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13 of the Act</LINK>. (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> On the learned judge's finding that the 1st appellant had a duty to ensure that the particulars in the registration certificate were accurate, reliable, well kept, valid and protected, it must be understood that it was practically impossible to ascertain the correctness of all information received on motor vehicles submitted for registration. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;8.;;">Section 8 of the Act</LINK> only provided that every Director should keep and maintain a register of all motor vehicles registered in the registration area for which he was a Director of and contain such information, details and particulars as the Director-General might from time to time direct. However, in the present case, the 1st appellant failed to update the register with the information received from Tenaga Insurance Berhad in 1996 that the motorcar was a stolen motorcar. The respondent purchased the motorcar on the available information in the register and the motorcar was duly registered in the respondent's name in April 1999, about three and a half years later. The register maintained by the 1st appellant pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;8.;;">s 8</LINK> must contain accurate particulars of all vehicles registered by the department. Prospective purchasers of vehicles and the motor trade industry rely on such information to conduct private and commercial transactions. If the registers were not reliable, the motor trade industry would be affected and so too the public purchasing second-hand vehicles (<i>Pendaftar Dan Pemeriksa Kereta-Kereta Motor, Melaka &amp; Ors v. KS South Motor Sdn Bhd</i>). (paras 31-36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Based on the authorities (<i>Pacific Forest Industries Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Lin Wen- Chih &amp; Anor; Datuk M Kayveas v. See Hong Chen &amp; Sons Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i>), the question on whether it was open to the Court of Appeal to decide the appeal on a provision of written law which was not pleaded in any cause papers or canvassed in the submissions of the parties in the High Court and the Court of Appeal itself was answered in the negative. (paras 39-43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The decision of the courts below to allow the respondent's claim was justified based on the case pleaded and the evidence adduced by the respondent. (para 45)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hasan Lah FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Leave was granted on 21 May 2013 to the appellants to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal given on 30 July 2012 on the following questions of law (in Malay):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 15 April 2014 this court granted leave to the appellants to pose the following additional questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellants were the defendants in the High Court and the respondent was the plaintiff. In the High Court Tenaga Insurance Berhad, an insurance company, which provided insurance coverage for the motor car from 8 August 1996 to 7 August 1997 was also joined as the 4th defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The facts of the case are these. Sometime in March 1999, the respondent intended to buy a used Mercedes Benz motor car bearing registration number NAN 1888. He was given a transfer form executed by the registered owner, Riwanis Modal Sdn Bhd, and the original motor vehicle registration form issued by the Road Transport Department ("Department"). The respondent had checked with the Department's records and found the particulars relating to the motor car to be correct and there were no impediments of the transfer of the motor car to him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondent proceeded with the purchase and applied to the 1st appellant for a Selangor number plate. This was approved and the number given was BFN 1888.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The transfer of ownership of the motor car to the respondent was completed on 1 April 1999. From the evidence given by the appellants' witnesses it was clear that no inspection was done on the motor car by the Department before the registration of the transfer of the ownership of the motor car to the respondent. That was the practice and procedure adopted by the Department in 1999. The Department would only rely on the documents submitted for the registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 27 April 1999 the motor car was seized by the police on suspicion that the motor car was a stolen motor car. Investigations by way of a chemical process carried out by the Chemistry Department revealed that the engine and chassis numbers of the motor car were tampered with and the chassis had been rejoined and welded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 9 May 2000 the respondent filed a suit against the three appellants and Tenaga Insurance Berhad for damages. The respondent's pleaded case was that the respondent suffered the losses as a result of the 1st appellant's negligence in:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In his defence, the 1st appellant inter alia denied that he was negligent and averred that the registration and the change of ownership of the motor car was done lawfully and in accordance with the procedure and the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">Road Transport Act 1987 ("Act")</LINK>. Alternatively, it was averred that the relevant documents were falsified by an unknown person or persons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> After a full trial, the High Court <i>inter alia</i> made the following findings on liability:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is to be noted that in finding that the 1st appellant had breached his statutory duty, the High Court relied on the decision of this Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_2_191;"><i>Ketua Polis Negeri Sembilan &amp; Anor v. Manoharan Dorasamy</i> [2003] 2 MLRA 191</LINK>; [2004] 3 MLJ 565; [2004] 1 CLJ 101; [2003] 6 AMR 673 ("<i>Manoharan</i>'s case").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Having found the three appellants liable, the High Court then made the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court but on different grounds. The Court of Appeal held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13 of the Act</LINK> deals with change of possession or ownership of vehicles and this provision does not require the vehicle to be inspected. The Court of Appeal, despite a clear decision by this court in <i>Manoharan</i>'s case, held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12 of the Act</LINK> do not apply to transfer of ownership of vehicles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Having ruled that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12 of the Act</LINK> do not apply to transfer of ownership of vehicles the Court of Appeal however went on to hold that by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;59.;;">s 59 of the Act</LINK> there is a duty imposed on the 1st appellant to inspect vehicles even after their registration. The Court of Appeal then concluded that the 1st appellant had failed in his duty of care in carrying out his functions under the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions Of The Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned Senior Federal Counsel submitted that the Court of Appeal ought to have allowed the appellants' appeal against the decision of the High Court after holding that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12 of the Act</LINK> do not apply to a transfer of possession or ownership of vehicles as the respondent's claim was based on those two sections.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was contended that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;59.;;">s 59 of the Act</LINK> there was a duty imposed on the 1st appellant to conduct inspections of motor vehicles even after they have been registered and that in the instant case the 1st appellant failed in his duty of care in carrying out his function under the Act. Firstly, it was submitted that the issue of duty to inspect vehicles after registration as provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;59.;;">s 59 of the Act</LINK> was never pleaded and argued by either party in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Secondly, it was contended that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;59.;;">s 59 of the Act</LINK> did not impose such a statutory duty on the 1st appellant. It merely conferred powers to the 1st appellant to do certain things. Since <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;59.;;">s 59 of the Act</LINK> did not impose a statutory duty on the 1st appellant, the 1st appellant did not breach any statutory duty. In support of that learned Senior Federal Counsel cited the following cases:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In response, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent's case was that the 1st appellant had breached his statutory duty as spelt out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12 of the Act</LINK> when the 1st appellant failed to carry out physical inspection of the motor car before registering the change of ownership of the motor car. It was contended by learned counsel for the Respondent that the issue relating to breach of statutory duty under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12</LINK> which is also applicable to the change of ownership of the motor car has been decided in <i>Manoharan</i>'s case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In its judgment the Court of Appeal made the following observations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The relevant parts of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">13 of the Act</LINK> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In <i>Manoharan</i>'s case, the transaction in question also involved a second-hand car, just like in the instant case. In that case the relevant facts are that Manoharan had agreed to purchase a Honda Accord 2.0 Ex(i) bearing registration number NAJ 1912 from one Dewarajoo a/l Gurusamy. On 25 January 1994 Manoharan took the said car to a motor workshop to have it examined. There, both he and the mechanic had, apart from examining the said car, checked both the engine and chassis numbers and found that they tallied with the details in the registration card of the said car. Only then was the purchase price agreed at RM70,000.00. On 27 January 1994 Manoharan paid Dewarajoo RM10,000.00 and a receipt was accordingly issued. Manoharan was also given the registration card.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> From the details in the registration card, it was clear that Dewarajoo had bought the said car from F &amp; C Motor Sdn Bhd in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah and the previous registration number of the said car was SS9554C. Earlier to that, the registered owner was Chin Hook Kee with a post box address in Sandakan, Sabah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The said car was detained by the police on 28 April 1994 on the ground that it was a stolen property. The Chemistry Department certified that the said car's engine number had been tampered with but the original number and the original owner could not be ascertained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Subsequently, Manoharan filed an originating summons in the High Court at Seremban for a declaration that he was the beneficial owner of the said car and that the registration effected by the Road Transport Department, Seremban, the 2nd appellant was binding since they were negligent in not making a proper check of the chassis and engine numbers. He also claimed for damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Manoharan's originating summons was dismissed by the High Court. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed Manoharan's appeal. Leave was granted by this court to Ketua Polis Negeri Sembilan &amp; Anor to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal on three questions of law. One of the questions of law was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the appeal learned Senior Federal Counsel submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">s 12 of the Act</LINK> imposes a discretion and not a duty on the Road Transport Department, Seremban, the 2nd appellant to inspect vehicles and the inspection was to be done only in the circumstances set out in subsection (1). In his judgment Abdul Malek Ahmad FCJ answered the question of law as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Abdul Hamid Mohamad JCA (as he then was), who was a member of the panel, wrote a supporting judgment for the case and made the following observations:</p>

      <b>[27]</b> It is therefore clear from the decision of this court in <i>Manoharan</i>'s case that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12 of the Act</LINK> impose a duty on the Director for Road Transport ("Director") to inspect every vehicle before registration or transfer of registration. In other words, the two sections are applicable to the registration of a motor vehicle under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">s 10</LINK> and the registration of a new owner under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13</LINK>, on a voluntary transfer made by the previous owner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In the instant case, the Court of Appeal held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12 of the Act</LINK> were only applicable to the registration of a motor vehicle and not to the change of possession (the registration of a new owner of motor vehicle like the instant case). We have carefully considered <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">13 of the Act</LINK> and the decision of this court in <i>Manoharan</i>'s case and, with respect, we agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal. The wordings of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;10.;;">ss 10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">12</LINK> are very clear and unambiguous that they only deal with the registration of motor vehicles. They do not deal with the change of possession of motor vehicles. We agree with the Court of Appeal that only <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13</LINK> applies to change of possession of a motor vehicle as what happened in the instant case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13(1) of the Act</LINK> the existing registered owner, on any change of possession of a motor, is required to forward to the Director a statement in the prescribed form within seven days after such change of possession. The new owner is also required to forward to the Director a statement in the prescribed form together with the registration certification and the prescribed fee within seven days. After they complied with the requirements the new owner is entitled to be registered as the new owner of the motor vehicle. Unlike <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;12.;;">s 12 of the Act</LINK> there is no requirement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13</LINK> for the Director to inspect the motor vehicle before the registration of a new owner of the motor vehicle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As such we are of the view that the 1st appellant did not breach his duty under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;13.;;">s 13</LINK> when he registered the respondent as the new registered owner of the motor car without first inspecting the motor car. For the reasons given our answer to the first question posed is in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> However, that is not the only ground the respondent based his action against the appellants. As stated earlier he also claimed that the 1st appellant was negligent in <i>inter alia</i> failing to keep and maintain an accurate and reliable registration system of motor vehicles and in failing to update its registration and information system with the latest information.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The learned trial judge held that the 1st appellant had a duty to ensure that the particulars in the registration certificate were accurate, reliable, well-kept, valid and protected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It must be noted, that would impose a heavy and burdensome duty to the 1st appellant as it is practically impossible to ascertain the correctness or accuracy of every information of each vehicle submitted for registration. Section 8 of the Act only provides that every Director shall keep and maintain a register of all motor vehicles registered under the Act in the registration area for which he is a Director and such register shall be in such form and contain such information, details and particulars as the Director-General may from time to time direct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It must be remembered that the evidence was adduced to show that the 1st appellant was informed by Tenaga Insurance Berhad (the 4th defendant) that in December 1996 the motor car was stolen. Unfortunately, the 1st appellant did not record that information in the register kept by the Department. The explanation given was that it was not the practice of the Department to record that information in its register. The motor car was registered in the respondent's name on 1 April 1999, which was 3½ years after the 1st appellant was informed that the motor car was stolen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The respondent made a search with the register kept by the 1st appellant and it was not shown from the register that the motor car was a stolen motor car. Acting on the information available and after satisfying himself that there was no problem with the motor car the respondent decided to buy the motor car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We are of the view that the registers maintained by the Department pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;8.;;">s 8 of the Act</LINK> must contain accurate particulars of all vehicles registered by the Department. This is because the prospective purchasers of the vehicles and those involved in the motor trade rely on such information to conduct private and commercial transactions. If the registers are not reliable they will affect those in the motor trade industry and the public who purchase second-hand vehicles. In this connection we agree with the observation made by Siti Norma Yaacob JCA (as she then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_140;"><i>Pendaftar Dan Pemeriksa Kereta-Kereta Motor, Melaka &amp; Ors v. KS South Motor Sdn Bhd</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 140</LINK>; [2000] 2 MLJ 540; [2000] 2 CLJ 573; [2000] 2 AMR 1838 at p 146:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> As regards the second question posed in the appeal it is to be noted that the High Court ordered the appellants to pay special damages of RM142,858.40 and interest of 8% per annum from the date of judgment to the date of realisation of the judgment sum and further ordered that general damages to be assessed by the Senior Assistant Registrar. The award was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The Senior Federal Counsel however chose not to make any submission on the second question of law posed in the appeal. As such we find it unnecessary to answer the question posed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> As regards the third question we are of the view that there are decisions from this court which had dealt with that issue. For example in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_471;"><i>Pacific Forest Industries Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Lin Wen-Chih &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 471</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 293; [2009] 6 CLJ 430, the first question of law posed in that case is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> At p 475 of the report, this court observed:</p>

      <b>[41]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_581;"><i>Datuk M Kayveas v. See Hong Chen &amp; Sons Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 581</LINK>; [2013] 2 MLJ 765; [2013] 5 CLJ 949; [2013] 6 AMR 101, one of the issues posed in the appeal is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> This court, at p 597, answered the question as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Based on the authorities cited above our answer to the third question posed is therefore in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> With such an answer given to the third question posed we find it unnecessary to answer the fourth question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Even though we answered the first and third questions in favour of the appellants, we find that the decision of the courts below to allow the respondent's claim is justified based on the case pleaded and the evidence adduced by the respondent. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</p>
