    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was a housing developer for a housing project ("the project"). The respondents purchased a unit from the appellant through a sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") dated 17 April 2006. Clause 23 of the SPA <i>inter alia</i>, required vacant possession of the unit to be delivered to the purchasers within 24 months from the date of the SPA, failing which the appellant was liable to pay the respondents liquidated and ascertained damages ("LAD"). Due to the flooding between December 2006 and early 2007, the project suffered financial difficulties and stalled. The project was classified as a "projek lewat" and "projek sakit" by the JPN, which reported that the project suffered delays because the appellant faced a <i>force majeure</i> (the flooding). The parties thereafter, due largely through the assistance and mediation by the JPN, entered into a settlement agreement formally dated as 10 October 2011 ("the SA"). The SA provided <i>inter alia</i>, that due to reasons beyond the control of the vendor (appellant), the vendor had requested for an extension of time to complete the project and that further, the vendor had also requested the purchasers (respondents) to waive the LAD for late delivery which the vendor was liable to pay, until the "New Completion Date". The new completion date was defined as 14 August 2011 or 12 months from the signing of the SA, whichever was later. The SA also provided that in the event vacant possession could not be delivered by the new completion date, the purchasers (the respondents) would be at liberty to make a claim for the LAD as if the extension of time was not granted. The appellant delivered to the respondents vacant possession of their unit on 9 January 2012 - well within 12 months from the date of the SA. However, the respondents filed a claim in the House-buyers Tribunal ("the Tribunal") against the appellant in respect of LAD for late delivery of the unit, from 17 April 2008 ie, the original date for delivery of vacant possession under the SPA. The Tribunal decided in the respondents' favour and awarded them a sum of RM50,000 as damages for late delivery. The appellant sued the respondents in the High Court for deceit and breach of the SA, and alternatively claimed damages for misrepresentation, fraudulent or otherwise. The High Court dismissed the appellant's claim. The High Court decided <i>inter alia</i>, that the SA was invalid on the basis that it contravened provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUBS_2003_347;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966</LINK>. The court also decided that the SPA was valid and had not been rescinded by the SA. The High Court found that the SA was an attempt to evade the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUBS_2003_347;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966</LINK> and the rules thereunder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court judge had materially erred in his assessment of the evidence and had failed to address the course of negotiations and meetings between the developer, the house buyers and the JPN in the context of the development being a "projek sakit" which was unfortunately delayed by <i>force majeure</i>. The developer made it plain that it could not continue with the project unless the LAD claims were waived in view of its financial difficulties resulting from the <i>force majeure</i>. The larger majority of house buyers, including the respondents, agreed to a waiver, had their houses completed and delivered by the appellant as developer/vendor within the new completion date as agreed under the SA. Despite agreeing to the waiver, the respondents still proceeded to file a claim with the Tribunal and obtained the award of RM50,000 in their favour for LAD calculated from the initial period of delay under the SPA. This action constituted a clear breach of the SA on the facts. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The signing of the SA would fall within the terms of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;64.;;">s 64 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> which dealt with the "dispensation" of a promise made to a promisee. The appellant's claim could only be defeated if the SA was illegal and flouted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, as either an agreement forbidden by law, or of such a nature as would defeat any law, or would be opposed to public policy. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was no total contracting out of the LAD provision in the SPA. If vacant possession had not been delivered by the new completion date, the respondents would have been at liberty to sue on the basis of the original LAD provision. Thus, there was no full contracting out and no situation where the purpose of the housing legislation being "to protect the weak against the strong" was ousted. In terms of policy, there should be nothing illegal in law for a SA to be negotiated with the full participation and direction from JPN with a view to save a failing housing project from being an abandoned project. It would be in the public interest, and in the interest of house buyers, if the law allowed a regulated settlement and waiver of LAD on terms as specified in the SA which was the subject matter of the instant appeal. It was therefore not right and proper for the respondents, despite their promise to conditionally waive the LAD under the SPA, to resile from their promise and sue for late delivery under the SPA as if the SA did not exist. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that the appellant had established its claim for deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation and there was accordingly no basis legally and evidentially for the extravagant claims for loss of profits and loss of reputation for "social undermining" to be allowed. Further, the appellant had not discharged its burden of proof and thus the Court of Appeal would agree with the High Court in its assessment in rejecting the claims for damages for loss of reputation and loss of profits.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A. The Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant in this appeal, Oxbridge Height Sdn Bhd, was a housing developer for a project described as Jaya Putra Perdana which comprised part of a larger project described as Bandar Jaya Putra. The respondents were purchasers of a double-storey terrace house in Phase B of Jaya Putra Perdana. The appellant was the vendor of the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant/plaintiff had sued the respondents/defendants in the High Court below for the tort of deceit, fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of a settlement agreement entered into between them. The High Court dismissed the appellant's claim with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>B. Our Decision In The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We allowed the appellant's appeal before us in part with an order that parties were to bear their own costs. The claim for breach of the settlement agreement was allowed with damages of RM50,000.00 to be paid by the respondents to the appellant together with judgment interest from the date of our order until full payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C. Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In the sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") executed between the parties dated 17 April 2006, which followed the standard agreement under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;;">Schedule G of reg 11(1) of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 ("the regulations")</LINK>, the usual provision on Liquidated and Ascertained Damages ("LAD") for late delivery was included. Clause 23 of the SPA required vacant possession of the building to be delivered to the purchaser within 24 calendar months from the date of the SPA, failing which the vendor (the developer) was liable to pay to the purchaser liquidated damages "calculated from day-to-day at the rate of 10% per annum of the purchase price from the expiry date of the delivery of vacant possession .... until the date the purchaser takes vacant possession of the same building."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The project stalled. According to the plaintiff, as the developer, the project suffered financial difficulties as a result of flooding (force majeure) from around December 2006 until early 2007. The project was classified by Bahagian Pemantauan Perumahan Swasta, Jabatan Perumahan Negara, Kementerian Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan ("JPN") as a "projek lewat" and "projek sakit". In the report produced by JPN, it was acknowledged that the project suffered delays because the developer faced a <i>force majeure</i> problem.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The parties then entered into a settlement agreement formally dated as 10 October 2011. This important agreement was tendered in court as exh P18 (appearing on pp 464 to 476 of the Appeal Record, Parts B &amp; C). The immediate parties to the settlement agreement were the appellant as vendor and several parties described as "the purchaser" as set out in sch 2 of the said agreement. There were altogether 41 purchasers included in sch 2, with the present respondents listed as purchaser no 11. It was also clear from sch 2 that the properties concerned phase 3B of the project. According to the appellant, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent acted as the representative of purchasers of phase 3B.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It appeared on the evidence that the signing of the settlement agreement was the result of the involvement and assistance of JPN and a series of meetings held between the parties. According to the appellant, JPN acted as a facilitator and mediator between the developer and the purchasers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Counsel for the appellant referred the court to the relevant reports and minutes of meetings prepared by JPN which appeared on pp 385 to 409 of the Appeal Record, vol 2 (3). It was in evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent attended the meetings as a representative for the purchasers of phase 3B. The background leading to the signing of the settlement agreement could be gleaned from the contents of an e-mail letter from Pengarah, Bahagian Pemantauan Perumahan Swasta (exh P2), appearing on pp 391 to 392 of the same volume of the Appeal Record. To quote salient parts of the e-mail letter:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the evidence, it was apparent that JPN was part and parcel of the negotiating process, and the proposed settlement agreement was extensively discussed between the parties. It was clearly proposed that the LAD was to be calculated from a new date of completion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Terms Of The Settlement Agreement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The settlement agreement was executed and formally dated, as stated earlier, as 11 October 2011, with the following principal terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> That the respondents executed the settlement agreement and that their property was subsequently delivered within time, were not matters in dispute. On the evidence, it appeared that more than 80% of purchasers affected in phase 3B executed the settlement agreement by 20 December 2010. See p 408 of the Appeal Record, vol 2(3), which contains the project update figures as at 20 December 2010. The respondents executed the settlement agreement on 28 July 2010, as evidenced on the signature page appearing at p 474 of the same volume of the Appeal Record.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We noted that the purchasers of phase 3B individually executed the settlement agreements on different dates. Hence, on p 470 of the same volume of the Appeal Record, we found purchaser No 17 executed the settlement agreement on 30 September 2011. There was justification therefore why the settlement agreement was formally dated as at 11 October 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> As far as the present respondents were concerned, delivery of vacant possession of their property was on 9 January 2012, which was therefore within the 12 months from the date of the settlement agreement, as defined in s 7 of the schedule therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Claim Before The Tribunal Tuntutan Pembeli Rumah</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Nevertheless, the respondents brought a claim before the Tribunal Tuntutan Pembeli Rumah in July 2012, claiming for LAD for late delivery of 1335 days calculated from 17 April 2008, which was the original date for delivery of vacant possession under the SPA. The Tribunal decided in their favour and awarded a sum of RM50,000.00 as damages for the late delivery claimed with interest at 8% on the amount if unpaid by 8 October 2012. The Award of the Tribunal appears on pp 480 to 481 of the Appeal Record, vol 2(3).</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Pleadings In The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The appellant then instituted the present claim in court against the respondents based on the tort of deceit and for breach of the settlement agreement. In the alternative, the appellant claimed for "misrepresentation, fraudulent or otherwise." See para 19 of the statement of claim appearing on p 36, Appeal Record, vol 1 (Part A).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The appellant pleaded that it was induced by the respondents to enter into the settlement agreement, to complete the construction of the property and to deliver vacant possession of the property to the respondents, by several representations made by the respondents. The appellant averred that the respondents knew and understood that the appellant would be able to utilise its financial resources to revive the housing project only if the purchasers did not pursue the claim for LAD for late delivery under the SPA. By entering into the settlement agreement and subsequently instituting a claim for LAD before the tribunal as well, the appellant argued that on this basis the representations were fraudulently made or were made with knowledge that they were false and untrue, or made recklessly without caring whether they were true or false. Paragraphs 23 to 25 of the statement of claim contained the gist of the appellant's claim for deceit and/or fraudulently misrepresentation:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant also averred that 44 other purchasers were led to cancel their purchase in July 2012 after the respondents filed their claim with the Tribunal. In para 17 of the statement of claim, the appellant pleaded:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Particulars Of Damages Claimed</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The appellant therefore claimed resultant loss and damage and provided the following particulars of damages:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>D. The High Court Judgment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The High Court dismissed the appellant's claim after a full trial. Two issues were addressed by the learned High Court Judge, namely (a) whether the respondents were liable for the tort of deceit, and (b) whether the respondents were liable to the appellant for breach of the terms of the settlement agreement. In dismissing the claim for deceit, the court found that there was no evidence that the respondents had agreed to waive the LAD, the waiver being merely a suggestion made by the respondents and the other purchasers. There was also no evidence, according to His Lordship, to establish that the respondents had, by filing their claim at the Tribunal, influenced the other purchasers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> As for the claim for breach of the terms of the settlement agreement, the court found the settlement agreement to be invalid on the basis that it contravened the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUBS_2003_347;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966</LINK>, and further, the SPA had remained valid and not rescinded by the settlement agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned High Court Judge concluded thus in relation to the 1<sup>st</sup> issue:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As regards the second issue on the invalidity of the settlement agreement, the learned High Court Judge concluded that it was an attempt to evade the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUBS_2003_347;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966</LINK> and the rules thereunder. The effect of the settlement was a contracting out of the law which provided the right to house buyers to claim for LAD for late delivery, even though a consideration of RM1.00 was paid. The court dismissed the argument that the settlement agreement was a collateral contract which could exist side-by-side with the SPA. The court drew on the decisions in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_111;"><i>MK Retnam Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Bhagat Singh Surian Singh</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 111</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 212; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 199, and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_473;"><i>Sentul Raya Sdn Bhd v. Hariram Jayaram &amp; Ors And Other Appeals</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 473</LINK>; [2008] 4 MLJ 852; [2008] 4 CLJ 618. The relevant part of the judgment reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>E. Our Evaluation On The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In our view, the substance of the appeal turned on the validity of the settlement agreement. It seemed to us obvious on the evidence that the respondents (especially the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent) had expressly agreed to waive the LAD claimable under the SPA. It could not be said this waiver was a mere suggestion. Why would the respondents execute the settlement agreement except to agree to waive the earlier LAD and to accept the new completion date? In our view, the learned High Court Judge had materially erred in his assessment of the evidence and had failed to address the course of negotiations and meetings between the developer, the house buyers and the JPN in the context of the development being a "projek sakit" which was unfortunately delayed by <i>force majeure</i>. The developer made it plain it could not continue with the project unless the LAD claims were waived in view of its financial difficulties resulting from the force majeure. The larger majority of house buyers, including the respondents, agreed to a waiver, had their houses completed and delivered by the appellant as developer/vendor within the new completion date as agreed under the settlement agreement. Despite agreeing to the waiver, the respondents still proceeded to file a claim with the tribunal and obtained the award of RM50,000.00 in their favour for LAD calculated from the initial period of delay under the SPA. This action constituted a clear breach of the settlement agreement on the facts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On the law, the signing of the settlement agreement would fall within the terms of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;64.;;">s 64 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> which deals with the "dispensation" of a promise made to a promisee:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The appellant's claim could only be defeated if the settlement agreement was illegal and flouted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, as either an agreement forbidden by law, or of such a nature as would defeat any law, or would be opposed to public policy. In this appeal, the respondents took a firm view on the effect of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUBS_2003_347;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966</LINK> and <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;;">reg 11(1) of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulation 1989</LINK>, in effect arguing that the LAD provision in the Schedule G standard form SPA could not be contracted out. The written submission was expressed thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As a general statement of the position of the law in the context of housing development legislation which exists to protect the interests of purchasers of housing accommodation and the public at large, the proposition could be agreed. The two decisions of our courts, referred to and applied by the High Court, remain good and binding authority under our law. <i>MK Retnam Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Bhagat Singh Surian Singh (supra)</i>, in particular, is a Supreme Court decision of considerable weight, and on the particular facts of that case, the Supreme Court had good ground to invalidate a second agreement entered into which extended the time for completion for an additional six months from the date of that agreement at an increased purchase price. The Supreme Court noted with some dismay that "[the] position of Bhagat Singh s/o Surian Singh when he signed the second agreement must be one of extreme desperation because by that time he had already retired from service and was renting a house and there had been a delay of more than a year from the due date of delivery of vacant possession under the first agreement." The Supreme Court also observed that "the Managing Director of the developer company admitted frankly that the real reason for the second agreement was to delay the date of delivery of the house and also to get an increase in the purchase price" and had "said candidly that he was 'not aware of any other reason'". One can therefore understand why the Supreme Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In a similar fashion, the views expressed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Sentul Raya Sdn Bhd v. Hariram Jayaram &amp; Ors And Other Appeals (supra)</i>, are also reflective of the policy of the law here to "protect the weak against the strong", again on its particular and peculiar facts. We indorse and accept the views expressed by the Court of Appeal, which was highlighted in the submissions before us. To quote the relevant passage and the reference to Schedule H contract being a "special contract":</p>

      <b>[28]</b> This was an appeal concerning, among other things, the issue whether a purchaser would be required to give notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;56.;;">s 56(3) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> when he or she chose to accept the delivery of vacant possession outside of the time for delivery and proceed further to sue for LAD under the standard form contract under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989</LINK>. It was argued that once the date for delivery of vacant possession had passed, time became at large such that by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;56.;;">s 56(3) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, the purchaser had to give notice to render time to be of the essence once more. The Court of Appeal found this argument to be without merit. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;56.;;">Section 56(3)</LINK> dealt with general contracts, not a special contract under the housing legislation. The Court of Appeal stated:</p>

      <b>[29]</b> It was also argued in that appeal that the financial crisis of 1997 frustrated the contract, and as such the developer should be excused from further performance, since performance had become commercially impossible. The following passage in the Court of Appeal judgment is of interest, and relevant to this instant appeal:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On a proper reading of this decision, we do not believe the Court of Appeal was totally excluding any question of waiver of LAD, especially conditional waiver. The Court of Appeal broached the possibility of compliance with a provision being excused by making a proper representation to the authorities. On the facts of this present appeal, this was exactly what transpired. The JPN was brought into the picture and kept fully appraised of the status of the housing project and the proposal of a settlement agreement to move the development forward to completion with a new completion date and a new date for calculating LAD. In the end, the property was completed and delivered to the respondents within the extended time. The developer also waived late payment interest. We have earlier alluded to cl 2.5 which provided that in the event vacant possession was not delivered on "the New Completion Date in the manner provided in the principal agreement", "the purchaser shall be at liberty to make a claim for the LAD as if this extension of time was not granted." Thus, even in the settlement agreement there was no total contracting out of the LAD provision in the SPA. If delivery of vacant possession had not been delivered by the New Completion Date, the respondents would have been at liberty to sue on the basis of the original LAD provision. We therefore found that on the peculiar facts of this appeal, there was no full contracting out and no situation where the purpose of the housing legislation being "to protect the weak against the strong" was ousted. In terms of policy, there should be nothing illegal in law for a settlement agreement to be negotiated with the full participation and direction from JPN with a view to save a failing housing project from being an abandoned project. It will be in the public interest, and in the interest of house buyers, if the law allowed a regulated settlement and waiver of LAD on terms as specified in the settlement agreement which was the subject matter of this appeal. It was therefore not right and proper for the respondents, despite their promise to conditionally waive LAD under the SPA, to resile from their promise and sue for late delivery under the SPA as if the settlement agreement did not exist.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We therefore allowed the appeal in part on this basis alone. The appeal was allowed in part because we were not persuaded that the appellant had established its claim for deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation, and there was accordingly no basis legally and evidentially for the extravagant claims for loss of profits and loss of reputation for "social undermining" to be allowed. It is trite that the burden of proof for deceit/fraud is high. Proof of fraud has to be on the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt even in civil cases. The law on this is presently clear (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_12;"><i>Asean Security Paper Mills Sdn Bhd v. CGU Insurance Bhd</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 12</LINK>; [2007] 2 MLJ 301; [2007] 2 CLJ 1; [2000] 2 AMR 1270, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_440;"><i>Yong Tim v. Hoo Kok Chong &amp; Anor</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 440</LINK>; [2005] 3 CLJ 229; [2005] 3 AMR 553 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_250;"><i>Saminathan v. Pappa</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 250</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 121). We did not believe the appellant had discharged its burden of proof on this high standard, and to this extent we agreed with the High Court in its assessment in rejecting the claims for damages for loss of reputation and loss of profits.</p>
