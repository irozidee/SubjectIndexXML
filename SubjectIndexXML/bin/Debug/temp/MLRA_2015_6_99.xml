    <p>The defendant was charged in the Sessions Court for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1)(b)</LINK> and alternatively under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 ('the Act')</LINK>. Prior to the commencement of the trial, the defendant applied to the Sessions Court to refer the question on the constitutionality of the Act to the High Court. Accordingly, the High Court by way of a special case referred the following questions to this court for determination: whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1) of the Act</LINK> contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) of the Federal Constitution ('FC')</LINK> and was therefore void under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4;;">art 4(1) FC</LINK>; and whether the Act was a valid and enforceable Act under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">FC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the application and ordering matter to be remitted to the Sessions Court for the proceedings to be continued):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The term "Parliament may by law" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) FC</LINK> should not be read restrictively but must be read harmoniously with the other provisions of the FC such as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162</LINK>. To say that the Act did not come within the ambit of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) FC</LINK> as it was not made by Parliament would give the phrase "Parliament may by law" a highly restrictive and rigid interpretation. On the contrary, the intention of the framers of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">FC </LINK>was to provide for the continuance of all existing laws including the Act, subject to any modifications as may be made so as to bring it into accord with the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">FC</LINK>. The existing law was only rendered void or invalid if it could not be brought into accord with the FC. This was to be contrasted with the treatment of post-Merdeka Day Legislation which by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4(1) FC </LINK>was rendered null and void to the extent of its inconsistency with the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">FC</LINK>. It followed therefore that the Act being the "existing law" at the material date should continue to be valid and enforceable post-Merdeka Day. (paras 23-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Having regard to the legislative history of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) FC</LINK>, it would appear that in the initial draft the "restriction" was to be qualified by the word "reasonable", however the word was omitted from the final draft by the Working Committee. In this instance, the court agreed with the view of the Supreme Court in <i>PP v. Pung Chen Choon</i>, that it was not for the court to determine whether the restriction imposed by the legislature pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> was reasonable or otherwise. That was a matter strictly within the discretion of the Legislature and not within the purview of the court. (paras 36-40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The restriction that may be imposed by the legislature under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) FC </LINK>was not without limit. This meant that the law promulgated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) FC</LINK> must pass the proportionality test in order to be valid. Here, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4 of the Act</LINK> was directed to any act, word or publication having a "seditious tendency". This was consistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(4) FC</LINK>, as it could not be said that the restrictions imposed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK> were too remote or not sufficiently connected to the subjects/objects enumerated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a)</LINK>. Furthermore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4 </LINK>was not a total prohibition as it was subject to a number of exceptions as provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;3.;;">s 3(2) of the Act</LINK>. Hence, upon close analysis, the restrictions imposed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4;;">s 4(1)</LINK> fell squarely within the ambit or parameter of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a) FC</LINK>. In the result, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1) of the Act</LINK> did not run counter to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a) FC</LINK>.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Arifin Zakaria CJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The defendant (accused in the Sessions Court) was charged in the Kuala Lumpur Criminal Sessions Court for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1)(b)</LINK> and alternatively under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4;;">s 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 (the Act)</LINK>. The principal charge proffered against the defendant reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The alternative charge reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The charges relate to two seditious statements made by the defendant as reported by the Malay Mail online on 14 August 2014. The statements read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The defendant claimed trial to the charges. Prior to the commencement of the trial, the defendant applied to the Sessions Court to refer the question on the constitutionality of the Act to the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 5 November 2014, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;84.;;">s 84 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (the CJA)</LINK>, the High Court by way of a special case referred the following questions to this court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Considering the two questions posed to us, we agree with the plaintiff that it is more appropriate to consider the second question first as it concerns the validity or enforceability of the entire Act. In the event that we answer the second question in the negative then the first question no longer arises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Second Question</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The second question concerns the validity or enforceability of the entire Act against the relevant constitutional provisions. At this juncture, it would be pertinent to briefly consider the origin of the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Act was first enacted as the Sedition Ordinance 1948 (the Ordinance) by the Federal Legislative Council and came into force on 17 July 1948. The Ordinance had effect throughout the Federation of Malaya. The Ordinance sought to consolidate the various existing Sedition Enactments in the Malay States and in the Straits Settlements into a single law. The Ordinance was later revised in 1969 under the Revision of Laws Act 1968 and renamed as the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;;">Sedition Act 1948 (the Act)</LINK>. It is therefore a pre-Merdeka law. Undeniably, the Act has the effect of restricting the freedom of speech and expression as enshrined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">Section 4 of the Act</LINK> under which the defendant was charged reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Being a pre-Merdeka law, naturally the Act was not enacted by Parliament as Parliament was only established after Merdeka.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> For ease of reference, we set out below the relevant part of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10 of the Constitution</LINK> which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Premised on the terms "Parliament may by law" and "Parliament may pass law" appearing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(4)</LINK>, learned counsel for the defendant contended that only Parliament has the sole authority to make law to restrict freedom of speech and expression and not any other bodies or authorities. This, the defendant contended is clear from the plain language of cls (1), (2)(a) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10</LINK>. Further, learned counsel contended that it is for Parliament to consider whether such a law is necessary or expedient on the grounds listed in the said Article. No other body is clothed with that authority. In support, learned counsel referred us to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_430;"><i>Dewan Undangan Negeri Kelantan &amp; Anor v. Nordin Salleh &amp; Anor</i> (1) [1992] 1 MLRA 430</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 697; [1992] 1 CLJ 72. That is a case concerning freedom of association as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(c)</LINK> of the Constitution. The relevant facts in that case were as follows. The Kelantan State Constitution by art XXXIA provides that a member of the State Legislative Assembly who is a member of a political party, shall cease to be a member of the legislative assembly if he resigns or for any reason ceases to be a member of such political party. The issue in that case was whether such a provision was inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(c)</LINK> of the Constitution and if so, to that extent invalid by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4(1) of the Constitution</LINK>. This court held, <i>inter alia</i>, that the restriction sought to be imposed by the State Constitution was invalid as the State Constitution, being State law, could not impose such a restriction.</p>
    <p>In so holding, Abdul Hamid Omar LP said:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Similarly, Gunn Chit Tuan SCJ stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Relying on that case, learned counsel submitted that only Parliament has the exclusive authority to enact law to restrict the rights as enshrined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10 of the Constitution.</LINK> Since the Act was not enacted by Parliament, therefore, it was not a valid law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In our view, that case may be distinguished from the present case on two grounds. First, as stated in that case the impugned law was a State law and not a Federal law and secondly, it is a post-Merdeka law. Hence, the impugned law in that case clearly runs counter to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(4) of the Constitution</LINK>, accordingly it is void under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4(1).</LINK></p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Having said that, the Act in the present case is a pre-Merdeka law, the issue, therefore, is whether it is saved by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162</LINK> of the Constitution. For ease of reference, we set out below the relevant provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162 of the Constitution</LINK>, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> "Existing law" is defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;160.;;">art 160(2)</LINK> to mean "... any law in operation in the Federation or any part thereof immediately before Merdeka Day;". The word "law" "... includes written law, the common law in so far as it is in operation in the Federation or any part thereof, and any custom or usage having the force of law in the Federation or any part thereof;".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Act, being a written law which was in operation in the Federation immediately prior to Merdeka Day clearly comes within the meaning of the term "existing law" as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;160.;;">art 160(2)</LINK>. On that premise, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the Act was saved by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162 of the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> What is the purport and intent of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162</LINK>? When Malaya achieved its independence on 31 August 1957, it is not possible for a new set of Legislations to be immediately enacted by Parliament to replace the "existing law". In the circumstances, it is inevitable that all laws then in operation will have to be continued until they are repealed. This is provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162 </LINK>which is a transitional provision intended to ensure the continuance of all existing laws after Merdeka Day with such modifications as may be made under the said Article and subject to any amendment as may be made by Federal or State law. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162(6)</LINK>, the court or tribunal are given further powers to make any necessary modification to any such law to bring it into accord with the Constitution. This was in fact done in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1968_1_886;"><i>Assa Singh v. Mentri Besar, Johore</i> [1968] 1 MLRA 886</LINK>; [1969] 1 MLJ 30. In that case, the applicant was arrested and detained under the Restricted Residence Enactment (FMS Cap 39) (Enactment). It was argued in that case that the Enactment has no provision: (i) for informing the person concerned of the grounds of his arrest and detention; (ii) for presenting him before a Magistrate or for an enquiry at which the detained person could answer the allegations made against him; (iii) for review and (iv) for limitation of the period of detention. Because of these reasons, it was submitted that the provisions of the Enactment were inconsistent with the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5 </LINK>and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9 of the Constitution</LINK>. In that case, it was held, <i>inter alia</i>, that even though the Enactment did not have provisions similar to those of cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5 of the Constitution</LINK>, this does not render it is unconstitutional despite such difference. However, it must be applied with such adaptations as may be necessary to bring it into accord with the Constitution. In the circumstances, the court held that the provisions of cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5 of the Constitution</LINK> must therefore be read into the provisions of the Restricted Residence Enactment.

    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Following the above authorities, we agree with the submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff that the term "Parliament may by law" as appearing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> should not be read restrictively but must be read harmoniously with the other provisions of the Constitution such as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162</LINK>. This is in consonant with the principle of interpretation of the Constitution as borne out in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_18;"><i>Dato' Menteri Othman Baginda &amp; Anor v.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> To say that the Act does not come within the ambit of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2) of the Constitution</LINK> as it was not made by Parliament would give it a highly restrictive and rigid interpretation to the phrase "Parliament may by law" as appearing in the said article. We are of the view that the framers of the Constitution in drafting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162</LINK> would have in their contemplation the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2),</LINK> and had they indeed intended that the phrase "the existing laws" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162.;;">art 162</LINK> is not to include the Act they could have done so in no uncertain term.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On the contrary, we are of the view that the intention of the framers of the Constitution is to provide for the continuance of all existing laws including the Act, subject to any modifications as may be made so as to bring it into accord with the Constitution. The existing law is only rendered void or invalid if it could not be brought into accord with the Constitution. This is to be contrasted with the treatment of post Merdeka Day Legislation which by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 (1)</LINK> is rendered null and void to the extent of its inconsistency with the Constitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> This is further affirmed by the object and purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;162;;">art 162</LINK> as may be discerned from paras 126 and 128 of the <i>Report of the Working Committee of Constitutional Proposals</i> in 1946 which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> What we can gather from the above is that, it is thus the intention of the framers of the Constitution to ensure that the existing law will continue to be valid and enforceable upon the coming into operation of the Constitution on Merdeka Day. It follows therefore that the Act being the "existing law" at the material date should continue to be valid and enforceable post-Merdeka Day.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For the above reasons, our answer to the second question is in the positive.</p>
    <p>
      <b>First Question</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The first question before us is whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1) of the Act</LINK> is consistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a) of the Constitution</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">Art 10(1)(a)</LINK> provides for freedom of speech, assembly and association. It is, however, commonly acknowledged that the rights conferred by the said Article are not absolute (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_72;"><i>PP v. Ooi Kee Saik &amp; Ors </i>[1971] 1 MLRH 72</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 108 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_632;"><i>Madhavan Nair &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 632</LINK>; [1975] 2 MLJ 264). This is clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> itself which states that the rights conferred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a)(b) and (c)</LINK> are subject to cls (2), (3) and (4). What concerns us here is the kind of restriction which may be imposed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a)</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">Art 10(2)</LINK> provides:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> By <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK>, Parliament is given the right to impose such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation and other grounds enumerated in cl (2)(a). What this means is that Parliament or the legislature is not free to impose any restrictions as they fancy; the restrictions must fall within the parameters set out by cl (2)(a) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10.</LINK> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_632;"><i>Madhavan Nair &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 632</LINK>; [1975] 2 MLJ 264, a case concerning the validity of a condition imposed by the police in a licence to convene a public meeting, Chang Min Tat J stated thus:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_58;8A.;;">s 8A(1) of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984</LINK> came for consideration of the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_507;"><i>PP v. Pung Chen Choon</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 507</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 566; [1994] 1 AMR 689. In that case the Supreme Court laid down some of the tests to be applied in determining whether the impugned law is consistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a) of the Constitution.</LINK> The court held, firstly, that there is a strong presumption of the constitutionality of the impugned law and the burden of proof lies on the party seeking to establish the contrary. And in deciding whether a particular piece of Legislation falls within the orbit of permitted restrictions, consideration must be given to the question whether such law is directed at a class of acts too remote in the chain of relation to the subjects enumerated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a)</LINK>. The test as propounded by the court is that the connection contemplated must be real and proximate, not far-fetched or problematical. At p 514 Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ elaborated on the test:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> However, since the Court of Appeal's decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_396;"><i>Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim v. Menteri Dalam Negeri Malaysia</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 396</LINK>; [2006] 6 MLJ 213; [2007] 1 CLJ 19, the court had imposed a further restriction on the law touching on the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution by applying the "reasonable" and "proportionality" tests in determining whether the impugned law is consistent with the Constitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In that case, Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) at p 398 stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The two tests were later affirmed by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_6_375;"><i>Sivarasa Rasiah v.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff urged us to depart from the reasonableness test as propounded by this court in <i>Sivarasa Rasiah</i> on two grounds namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is to be contrasted with art 19(2) of the Indian Constitution which stipulates that such law may only impose reasonable restriction. This distinction was expressly acknowledged by the Supreme Court in <i>Pung Chen Choon</i>. In that case, the court opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Having regard to the legislative history of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2), </LINK>it would appear that in the initial draft the "restriction" was to be qualified by the word "reasonable", as in the case of art 19(2) of the Indian Constitution. The word was however omitted from the final draft by the Working Committee, adopting the dissenting opinion of Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan, a member of the Reid Commission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> For those reasons, we are inclined to agree with the view of the Supreme Court in <i>Pung Chen Choon</i>, that it is not for the court to determine whether the restriction imposed by the legislature pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> is reasonable or otherwise. That, in our opinion, is a matter strictly within the discretion of the legislature and not within the purview of the court. Similarly, we are of the view that the reasoning in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1975_1_75;"><i>Ooi Ah Phua v. Officer-In-Charge Criminal Investigation, Kedah/Perlis</i> [1975] 1 MLRA 75</LINK>; [1975] 2 MLJ 198 does not justify the insertion of the word "reasonable" before the word "restriction" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK>. In <i>Ooi Ah Phua</i>, the Federal Court was concerned with the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(3)</LINK>, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Suffian LP construed that provision in the following words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The learned judge in <i>Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim</i> relying on the above statement by Suffian LP opined that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> With respect, the reasoning of the learned judge cited in <i>Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim</i> in our view is flawed since in <i>Ooi Ah Phua</i> the court was concerned with the interpretation of the words "... as soon as may be ..." which relates to the time within which a person arrested is to be allowed to consult his lawyer and the court opined that in the circumstances a balance need to be drawn between the interest of the accused and the interest of justice. Therefore the words "... as soon as may be ..." cannot be construed to mean "immediately" upon arrest. That interpretation arose from the special wordings of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(3).</LINK> It is, in our view, fallacious to use the reasoning in <i>Ooi Ah Phua</i> as warranting us to insert the word "reasonable" before the word "restriction" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2).</LINK> That would be rewriting the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK>. For those reasons we depart from the view of the Court of Appeal in <i>Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim</i> as affirmed by this court in <i>Sivarasa Rasiah</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Proportionality Test</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> This court in <i>Sivarasa Rasiah</i> also alluded to the proportionality test in determining whether a given law is consistent with the Constitution. This test emanates from the equality clause housed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8(1)</LINK>. The learned judge in <i>Sivarasa Rasiah</i> considered the statement of Gubbay CJ in <i>Nyambirai v. National Social Security Authority</i> [1996] 1 LRC 64, the leading authority on the matter, which was approved by the Privy Council in <i>Elloy de Freitas v. The Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Lands and Housing &amp; Ors</i> [1998] UKPC 30. In that case Lord Clyde stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The proportionality principle/test was explained by the Court of Appeal in <i>Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim</i> in the passage we earlier quoted at para 33. In short, the learned judge said that the Legislation or executive action must not only be objectively fair but must also be proportionate to the object sought to be achieved.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In this regard, we agree with the learned judge in <i>Sivarasa Rasiah</i>, that the restriction that may be imposed by the legislature under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> is not without limit. This means to say that the law promulgated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> must pass the proportionality test in order to be valid. This, in our view is in line with the test laid down in <i>Pung Chen Choon</i> discussed earlier. Having said that, we will now consider whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1) of the Act</LINK> would pass the proportionality test. One thing is clear, this section is directed to any act, word or publication having a "seditious tendency" as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;3.;;">s 3(1)</LINK> paras (a) to (f) of the Act. This in our view is consistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(4) of the Constitution</LINK>, as it cannot be said that the restrictions imposed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK> is too remote or not sufficiently connected to the subjects/objects enumerated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a)</LINK>. Furthermore, this is not a total prohibition as it is subject to a number of exceptions as provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;3.;;">s 3(2) of the Act</LINK>. As legislated, it is not seditious to show that any ruler has been misled or mistaken in any of his measures, or to point out errors or defects in any Government or constitution as by law established. Upon close analysis, we agree with the plaintiff's submission that the restrictions imposed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK> fall squarely within the ambit or parameter of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a) of the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the result, we hold that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1) of the Act</LINK> does not run counter to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)(a) of the Constitution</LINK>.
