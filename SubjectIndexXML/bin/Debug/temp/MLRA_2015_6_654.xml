    <p>The four appellants faced two charges under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;57.;;">s 57(1)(a) and (b) of the Internal Security Act 1960</LINK>. The first charge was in respect of the unlawful possession of six firearms, whereas the second charge related to the unlawful possession of multiple rounds of assorted ammunition. At the end of the trial, all the four appellants were convicted on the charges and sentenced to death. They appealed to the Court of Appeal against convictions and sentences. At the appeal, the following grounds were raised, <i>inter alia</i> : (i) the absence of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> in the charges; and (ii) the appellants' defence was not adequately considered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellants' appeal, setting aside the sentences and acquitting the appellants):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The two charges literally translated meant that the appellants were in 'joint possession' of the firearms and ammunition. This was a far cry from the essence of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> where each person was liable for the act in the same manner as if he did the act alone. It was imperative that the prosecution prove the charges against each and every appellant. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the prosecution had failed to prove that each and every appellant were in possession of the said firearms and bullets apart from showing that all the four appellants slept and were arrested in the same room where the firearms and bullets were recovered. However, the factum of sleeping together in the same room and getting arrested together in the same room did not indicate which one of the four or that all the four of them had the care and management of the said room, as there was no evidence that they were acting in concert with each other. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was no evidence as to which one of the four or that all the four appellants had possession of each of the same. The prosecution failed to prove exactly what part was taken or played by each of the four appellants. Additionally, the prosecution failed to distinguish the individual acts of each of the appellants in the commission of the offence. There was also no evidence that they were acting in concert and since they were not charged in furtherance of the common intention of all under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>, it meant that none of the appellants would equally be liable for the act of any one of them as if the act (of unlawful possession) were done by him alone, notwithstanding that it was the other person(s) who actually committed the offence. The same was equally true in respect of the possession of the bullets recovered from the same room. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The existence of common intention is a question of fact. It may be proved by direct evidence or by way of inferences from the circumstances of the case or upon proved facts. In the instant case, the evidence did not support the existence of common intention of all the appellants to commit the offence. Apart from the fact that the appellants were arrested together in the said room, there was a dearth of evidence to link them with the commission of the crime in furtherance of the common intention. The prosecution failed to establish that the appellants had some knowledge that an act may be committed which is consistent with the furtherance of the common intention or would be in furtherance of the common intention. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The prosecution had also to establish that there was a pre-arranged plan to commit the criminal act of having unlawful possession of the firearms and ammunition and the said act was done in concert to that pre-arranged plan. Such planning could develop on the spot or in the course of the commission of the offence. However, there were none of these either through direct evidence or by way of inferences from the circumstances of the case. Being together in the same room without more could hardly be said to constitute a pre-arranged plan. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> There was no evidence to link the firearms in the first charge and the bullets in the second charge to any of the appellants. Fingerprint impressions were not lifted from the firearms recovered. Neither was any DNA investigation done to link the firearms to the appellants, although the chemist report did reveal the DNA of other persons on other articles. CCTV recordings on the same floor as the room was not investigated. Had the judge properly appraised the evidence, she would have found there was no evidence to link the firearms and bullets to the appellants, apart from the fact that they were caught sleeping together in the room. (paras 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 &amp; 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The first charge referred to six firearms whereas the second charge referred to 336 bullets of various types. However, the trial judge found all four appellants guilty of having unlawful possession of two firearms only in respect of the first charge and of having unlawful possession of 39 rounds of 9mm bullets and 18 rounds of .45 Auto 90 bullets. No consequential amendments to the charges were instituted by the trial judge to reflect her findings. This was most prejudicial to the defence. The trial judge failed to address the issue of the remaining four firearms and remaining bullets. (paras 35-36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> At the highest, what had been proven was mere proximity of the incriminating exhibits with the four appellants. However, mere proximity in the absence of compelling, incriminating evidence did not amount to possession. The evidence as it were, did not disclose any link of any of the firearms or the bullets to any of the appellants, including the two pistols and bullets alluded to by the trial judge in her findings. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The trial judge had not properly evaluated the defence at all. The failure by the trial judge to evaluate and consider the issues posited by the defence was a violation of s 182A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which provided that at the conclusion of the trial, the court shall consider all the evidence adduced before it and shall decide whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The judge failed to conduct this exercise in her decision to convict all the four appellants. Her failure amounted to a misdirection. (paras 39 &amp; 41)</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the end of the trial all the four appellants were convicted of both the charges and sentenced to death. Hence these appeals before us against the said convictions and sentences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Case For The Prosecution</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 4 February 2007 at about 3.45am, acting upon information received, SP-15 (Supt Azman bin Ayob) and his team raided room No 6104, Pyramid Tower Hotel, Bandar Sunway, Subang Jaya. With the assistance of SP-7 (Rosli bin Mohd Hassan) the assistant security manager of the hotel, they managed to neutralise the security lock of the door to the room. The door was further locked from inside. SP-8 (S/Mejar Abu Hashim) kicked the door and had the door opened. The entire police team then rushed into the room.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> SP-9 (Insp Rajenderan a/l Y. Kandiah) saw the 3rd appellant raising from the sofa he was seated on and tried to grab a pistol on the make-up table (table 'A' in sketch plan exh P-158). However SP-9 managed to subdue the 3rd appellant with the assistance of a member of the team after a brief struggle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Meanwhile, SP-10 (D/Sjn Mejar Sukdarshan Singh) saw the 1st appellant trying to grab a pistol on a small table placed between the two beds in the room (table 'B' in same sketch plan). Nevertheless he was also subdued and detained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> SP-11 (D/Corp Malatambi a/l Vadivelu) managed to detain the 2nd appellant while on bed and the 4th appellant was arrested by SP-13 (D/Sjn Chong Teck Fatt).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Upon full investigation of the room, the police recovered:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Findings Of Trial Judge At End Of The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned judge found that all the four appellants were in unlawful possession or custody of the Colt pistol marked P-9B together with the magazine marked P-9C containing 10 pieces of .45 auto 96 bullets and the magazine marked P-9D containing eight pieces of bullets (on the table marked 'B') and the Glock pistol marked P-8B together with the magazine marked P-8C containing 17 pieces of bullets and two other magazines containing 11 pieces of bullets each and marked P-8D and P-8E respectively (on the table marked 'A'). The learned judge also found that the location where the said firearms and bullets were found were within the security area as declared by DYMM Yang di-Pertuan Agong vide PU(A)148 dated 15 May 1969.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned judge concluded:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> All the four appellants shared a common defence. The 1st, 2nd and 4th appellants are Thai nationals and came to Malaysia for a sightseeing tour together with three others namely Weeraphong, Somlit and Vinai. Their first destination was Kuala Terengganu where they met the 3rd appellant there. Meanwhile, Somlit and the two others proceeded to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 1 February 2007 they went to Kuala Lumpur and met Somlit at the Mandarin Court Hotel and put the night at the said hotel. On 2 February 2007, all four of them and Somlit changed their hotel and put up at Hotel Armada. On 3 February 2007, all the four appellants again shifted their hotel and stayed at Sunway Lagoon Hotel. In the evening they shifted to Hotel Pyramid Tower and the room (No 6104) was registered under the 4th appellant's name. Next they went sightseeing and later met Somlit and three others at KFC Sunway.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Somlit told them that they wanted to put several bags in their hotel room. The 3rd appellant gave one of the keycards of their room to Somlit who then left with the three others who came with him. Thereafter all the four appellants went back to their hotel and retired to their room at about 12.00 midnight after spending time at the hotel's coffee house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The 1st appellant woke up when he was pulled down from the bed in the room and denied that he had tried to grab the pistol lying on table 'B', placed between the two beds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The 2nd appellant stated that the police placed the pistol on the tables in the room. The three other appellants also said that the police took the pistols from the bags and placed them on the tables.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The 3rd appellant denied that he had tried to grab the pistol placed on table 'A'. He passed out when he was hit on his head and regained consciousness only at the hospital. He denied signing the search list (exh P-241) prepared by SP-15 as at the material time he was alleged to have signed the same, he was already warded in the hospital.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The 4th appellant said that the said room was registered in her name. However under cross-examination she admitted that the bill was paid by the 3rd appellant as according to the 3rd appellant, foreigners may be offered a discount.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> All the four appellants denied having knowledge of the firearms and bullets found in the room. They also contended that some of the bags found in the room did not belong to them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Finding Of The Trial Judge At The End Of The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> At the conclusion of the trial, the learned judge found that the defence posited by the appellants were mere denials. They were in full control and custody of the said room where the two firearms were found with the bullets. All the four appellants were arrested in the said room.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> She found that all the four appellants were having unlawful custody and possession of the said two firearms and bullets and the location where the same were found were in a security area. The defence failed to raise any reasonable doubt upon the prosecution's case and concluded:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The appeals before us could broadly be grounded upon two grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Absence Of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">Section 34 Of The Penal Code</LINK> In The Charges</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned counsels submitted that the absence of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code (PC)</LINK> in the charges against the appellants means that the prosecution must prove the charges on each and every appellant and not just prove on one appellant. There were also no evidence either direct or corroborative in terms of DNA findings, fingerprint impressions or CCTV recordings to link the firearms and bullets to each and every appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We were with the aforesaid submissions. The two charges alluded to "... telah ada dalam milik kamu bersama ...". Literally translated it means they were in joint possession of the same, a far cry from the essence of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the PC</LINK> where each of such person is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act is done by him alone. Hence in such event it is imperative that the prosecution must prove the charges against each and every appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Our attention was drawn to the case of <i>R v. Abbot</i> [1955] 2 All ER 899 which was referred to in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1988_2_85;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Aris Yunus</i> [1988] 2 MLRH 85</LINK>; [1989] 2 CLJ 289 which we found to be on all fours with the issue presently before us. The relevant passage is worth reproducing:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Having perused through the evidence, we were again with the learned counsels that the prosecution has failed to prove that each and every appellant were in possession of the said firearms and bullets apart from showing that all the four appellants slept and were arrested in the same room where the firearms and bullets were recovered. However, we opined that the factum of sleeping together in the same room and got arrested together in the same room does not indicate which one of the four or that all the four of them had the care and management of the said room as there is no evidence that they were acting in concert with each other.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The Glock pistol (exh P-8B) was said to have been recovered from table 'A' and the Colt pistol (exh P-9B) was recovered from table 'B' and the four other firearms were recovered from the 'Billabong' bag. But the prosecution could not and had failed to show who had committed the offence in respect of each of the firearms. Very likely one or the other three or any one of the four or all four of them must have possession of the said firearms but there was no evidence as to which one of the four or that all the four appellants had possession of each of the same. The prosecution failed to prove exactly what part was taken or played by each of the four appellants. Additionally, the prosecution failed to distinguish the individual acts of each of the appellants in the commission of the offence. Equally there is no evidence that they were acting in concert and since they were not charged in furtherance of the common intention of all under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the PC</LINK>, it means that none of the appellants would equally be liable for the act of any one of them as if the act (of unlawful possession) was done by him alone, notwithstanding that it was the other person(s) who actually committed the offence. The same is equally true in respect of the possession of the bullets recovered from the same room.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) implored upon us that the wording "telah ada dalam milikan kamu" gave the appellants sufficient notice that they were charged for having joint possession of the said firearms and bullets. The absence of the word "<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK>" in the charges does not make the charges defective. It is merely an irregularity under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;153.;;">s 153 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> and is curable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422</LINK> of the same. It is neither a substantive evidence but only a rule of evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The learned DPP went on to submit that on the evidence as adduced, the prosecution had indeed proven that the appellants have joint possession of the said firearms and bullets in furtherance of the common intention of them all, notwithstanding the absence of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the PC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The existence of common intention is a question of fact and it may be proved by direct evidence or by way of inferences from the circumstances of the case or upon proved facts. Having perused the evidence, we opined that the evidence does not support the existence of common intention of them all to commit the offence. Apart from the fact that the appellants were arrested together in the said room, there is a dearth of evidence to link them with the commission of the crime in furtherance of the common intention. The prosecution failed to establish that the appellants have some knowledge that an act may be committed which is consistent with the furtherance of the common intention or would be in furtherance of the common intention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The prosecution must also establish that there was a pre-arranged plan to commit the criminal act of having unlawful possession of the firearms and bullets and the said act was done in concert to that pre-arranged plan. Such planning could develop on the spot or in the course of the commission of the offence. However, we found none of these either through direct evidence or by way of inferences from the circumstances of the case. Being together in the same room without more can hardly be said to constitute a pre-arranged plan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Evidence To Link The Four Appellants With The Firearms And Bullets/Ammunition</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We further found that there is no evidence to link the firearms (in first charge) and bullets (in second charge) to any of the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Fingerprint impressions were not lifted from the firearms recovered from the Billabong bag and the pistols recovered from table 'A' and table 'B'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> No DNA investigation was done to link the firearms in the Billabong bag and the pistols to the appellants. The chemist report (at p 1003 vol 8 ROA) was silent in respect of this investigation. Interestingly the chemist report revealed that the DNA of other persons were found on other articles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> SP-12, the security manager of the hotel testified that every floor of the hotel has a CCTV camera and the recordings would be preserved for at least two weeks. However the IO did not ask from SP-12 the CCTV recording for the sixth floor where room No 6104 was located. If the CCTV recordings were investigated, they may show which appellant(s) had carried/in possession of which bag in particular the Billabong bag which contained at least four firearms and the bullets. They would also show the truth or falsity of the appellants' claim that Somlit and his friends had also deposited several bags in the said room. This would settle once and for all the issue whether the bags, their contents and the firearms and bullets found therein belonged to the appellants. Additionally, the photographs extracted in the lift did not show any of the appellants carrying any bag that resembled the Billabong bag containing the firearms.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The issues enumerated above were not addressed by the learned judge. Had she done so, she would have found that there is no evidence to link the said firearms and bullets to the appellants apart from the fact that they were caught sleeping together in the said room.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Two Pistols And 57 Bullets In The Findings Of The Learned Judge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The first charge alluded to six firearms of various types and the second charge referred to 336 pieces of bullets, also of various types. But the learned judge found all the four appellants guilty of having unlawful possession only in respect of two pistols (exh P-8B and P-9B). She made no finding at all regarding the other four firearms when pronouncing her <i>prima facie</i> findings and also when convicting the four appellants at the end of the defence case. The same is true in respect of the second charge wherein she found all the four appellants guilty of having unlawful possession of 39 pieces of 9 mm bullets and 18 pieces of .45 Auto 90 bullets when the charge alluded to 336 bullets of various types. No consequential amendments to the charges were instituted by the learned judge though to reflect her findings. This alone is the most prejudicial to the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Thus it begs the question as to the remaining four firearms and bullets. The learned judge failed to address this issue. If the learned judge was of the view that there is no evidence to link the four appellants with the four other firearms and the remaining bullets, then what is the basis of her findings of unlawful possession in respect of the two pistols (exhs P-8B and P-9B) and the 57 bullets (39 + 18) given that the circumstances under which all the firearms and bullets that were recovered were the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We opined that at the highest what has been proven was mere proximity of the incriminating exhibits with the four appellants. Mere proximity in the absence of compelling, incriminating evidence does not amount to possession. The evidence as it was, does not disclose any link of any of the firearms or the bullets to any of the appellants, including the two pistols and bullets alluded to by the learned judge in her findings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>None Consideration Of The Appellants' Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The defence posited that they came to Malaysia with Somlit and three others. They went separate ways and somewhere in between they reunited. In late afternoon on 3 February 2007 they met Somlit with three others at KFC Sunway wherein Somlit told them that they wanted to put several bags in their hotel room. The 3rd appellant then gave one of the key cards of their room to Somlit who then left the scene with his friends. They claimed that some of the bags and the bag containing the firearms and bullets were not theirs but Somlit's. The pistols on the tables were in the said bag and the police took it out and placed the same on the tables.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It is apparent that in her grounds of judgment the learned judge did not touch this aspect of the defence at all. There was no evaluation and equally she did not make any findings whether Somlit and his friends were real or otherwise and if Somlit and his friends do exist, the role played by them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The learned judge also did not consider that no fingerprint impressions were lifted from the firearms and the bullets. The learned judge also did not take into account that no DNA investigation was done on the firearms. Equally not considered was the fact there were CCTV recordings on each of the hotel floor and these CCTV recordings, in particular on the sixth floor, were never investigated by the IO of the case. The learned judge also did not consider that two key cards of the room were issued to the 3rd appellant but only one key card was recovered and tendered in court, giving credence to the 3rd appellant's testimony that he gave one of the cards to Somlit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In our view, the failure by the learned judge to evaluate and consider the above said issues posited by the defence is a violation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> which provides that at the conclusion of the trial, the court shall consider all the evidence adduced before it and shall decide whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Clearly the learned judge failed to conduct this exercise in her decision to convict all the four appellants. This failure amounted to a misdirection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> For all the reasons enumerated above, we opined that the convictions against all the four appellants were unsafe. Hence we allowed their appeals. We set aside their convictions and sentences and ordered them to be acquitted and discharged forthwith.</p>
