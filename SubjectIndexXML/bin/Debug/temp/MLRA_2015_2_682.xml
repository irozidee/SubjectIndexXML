    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent had sued the appellant for the recovery of outstanding amounts under two loans. The High Court allowed the respondent's action but dismissed a counterclaim filed by the appellant. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The respondent raised several preliminary objections: (i) the memorandum of appeal was defective in that it was undated; (ii) the judgment in the Record of Appeal was defective in that it was not the judgment; and (iii) the judgment was filed out of time and/or without leave.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> A document that is neither signed nor dated is a draft. If the document is dated but not signed, it is still a draft. If the document is signed but not dated, the document is not intended to be in effect and is at best a final draft. A party relying on such document takes the risk of the document being reneged upon. Only when a document is both signed and dated is the document clothed with full legal existence and significance as from its date. In the instant case, since the memorandum of appeal was undated, the respondent was entitled to doubt whether it was safe to rely upon it as the memorandum of appeal and to commit considerable time, effort and costs to prepare and respond to the grounds set out thereunder. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> A signed but undated memorandum of appeal would fail to comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;SN18.;;">r 18 of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994</LINK>. The breach in the instant case was therefore a breach of a fundamental rule and could not be excused in a court of justice on the grounds of inadvertent error or on the assertion it would not prejudice the respondent. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was acknowledged that the judgment in the record of appeal was not the judgment of the court. The differences could not also be described as minor. However, since the judgment might be produced in court on the day of the hearing itself, there was no merit in the objections concerning the defective judgment. Notwithstanding that, the objection that the undated memorandum of appeal resulted in the record of appeal being defective remained valid. Therefore, the purported memorandum of appeal would be struck out. (paras 19-25)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> By a vesting order dated 27 September 2005, the plaintiff Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Berhad ("the respondent") became vested with the rights and interests of Bank Industri &amp; Teknologi Malaysia Berhad which had granted to the defendant Owners Of The Ship Or Vessel Sasacom 1 ("the appellant") under a Facility Agreement dated 9 February 2001 a revolving bridging loan facility for the aggregate amount of RM14,000,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Asserting that the appellant defaulted in the loan repayments, the respondent commenced an admiralty action against Sasacom 1. Sasacom 1 was arrested. While under arrest, it sank. Subsequently, the respondent commenced a civil suit to recover from the appellant the amount outstanding under the two loans.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant's defence was that the revolving bridging loan was repaid by the assignment of sale proceeds from the construction of six patrol boats in Iraq, and the respondent's claim is barred by limitation. The appellant counterclaimed against the respondent for a full account of all the sale proceeds or proceeds under the letter of credit issued by the National Bank of Jordan which was assigned to the respondent by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant counterclaimed against the respondent for damages to be assessed for the sinking of the Sasacom 1 while under arrest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The High Court entered judgment for the respondent and dismissed the counterclaim by the appellant as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant appealed to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the date of hearing of the appeal on 18 October 2012, and after waiting all day, the parties requested the court to proceed to consider the appeal and deliver decision on another date on the basis of the written submissions. The date 28 November 2012 was set down for decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminary Objections</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Preliminary objections, notice of which were given on 11 October 2012, were raised by the respondent. These are in relation to the memorandum of appeal and the copy of the judgment in the Supplementary Record of Appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The defect complained of is that the memorandum of appeal is undated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Responding to the preliminary objection, it was submitted for the appellant as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The issue is not whether the respondent was misled or prejudiced, but whether the appellant had filed a valid memorandum of appeal within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;SN18.;;">r 18 of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It is trite if a document is neither signed nor dated, it is a draft. It follows if it is dated but not signed it is a draft nevertheless. But if it is signed but not dated, it is signed but not intended to be in effect. It is at best a final draft. A party relying upon it takes the risk of the document being reneged upon. Only when a document is both signed and dated is it clothed will full legal existence and significance as from its date. Since the document purporting to be the memorandum of appeal is undated, the respondent is entitled to doubt whether it is safe to rely upon it as the memorandum of appeal and commit the considerable time, effort and costs required to prepare and respond to the grounds set out upon findings of fact after a full trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The purpose the provision in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;SN18.;;">r 18</LINK> to file a memorandum of appeal is to give the respondent the opportunity to prepare and respond to the grounds laid out in the memorandum of appeal. It is a fundamental rule of justice. The appellant cannot put forward without leave of the court any other ground: See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;SN18.;;">r 18</LINK> subrule (2). It is clear that a signed but undated memorandum of appeal fails to comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;SN18.;;">r 18</LINK>. The breach in this case is therefore a breach of a fundamental rule and cannot be excused in a court of justice on the grounds of inadvertent error or on the assertion it does not prejudice the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> There is a plethora of cases that the compliance with the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;SN18.;;">r 18</LINK> is mandatory. It is only necessary to refer here to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_275;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 275</LINK>; [2010] 1 CLJ 444 (CA) it was held by the Court of Appeal that the memorandum of appeal was defective on the grounds that it was in the English language, unsigned and undated. An application for leave to appeal to the Federal Court upon the sole question of law whether the grounds of judgments of the Court of Appeal and that of the High Court, which were in the English language, are null and void, having regard to the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;152.;;">art 152 of the Federal Constitution ("the Constitution")</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_32;8.;;">s 8 of the National Language Act 1963/1967 ("the NLA 1963/67")</LINK> was dismissed. There was no application for leave to appeal on the question of the memorandum of appeal being unsigned or undated. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_251;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 251</LINK>; [2011] 1 MLJ 145; [2011] 1 CLJ 1 (FC)).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> To accept as compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;SN18.;;">r 18</LINK> a memorandum of appeal that is undated would be to contradict the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Judgment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The objections concern a further defect in the Record of Appeal to be filed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;18.;;">r 18</LINK>. Rule 18 subrule (4)(d) requires that a copy of the judgment, decree or order appealed from be filed in the Record of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It was submitted for the respondent that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was submitted for the appellant that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> That the copy of the judgment in the supplementary Record of Appeal is not the judgment of the court was acknowledged. We are not persuaded with the submission that the differences can be described as minor. The copy of the amended judgment was produced, again improperly in the Bundle of Authorities, confirmed the changes were limited to those year 2001 to 2002 and RM7,604,417.11 to RM7,704,417.11.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Production of the sealed order of the court appealed from in the Record of Appeal is a perennial problem. Its availability is not solely under the control of the appellant. This is recognised when Practice Direction No 1 of 1995 of the Court of Appeal was issued. It provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> See also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_10;"><i>Megat Najmuddin Dato' Seri (Dr) Megat Khas v. Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 10</LINK>; [2002] 1 MLJ 385; [2002] 1 CLJ 645; [2002] 1 AMR 1089.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Since as an alternative it is allowed to produce the judgment on the day of hearing itself, we find no merit in the ground of objection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Notwithstanding dismissal of the ground of objection on the copy of the judgment, the objection that the undated memorandum of appeal results in the Record of Appeal being defective remains valid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In <i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad (supra)</i>, the Court of Appeal struck out the unsigned undated purported memorandum of appeal in the English language and dismissed the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We, therefore, allow the preliminary objection on the first ground, strike out the purported memorandum of appeal and dismiss the appeals with costs, fixed at RM10,000.00.</p>
