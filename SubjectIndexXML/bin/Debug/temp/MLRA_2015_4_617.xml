    <p>The appellant operated a hotel ("the hotel") and was at all material times a registered user and consumer of the respondent. The respondent supplied the electricity to operate the hotel. The hotel's electric meter was within the hotel premises but in a room under the control of the respondent. The room was secured by lock and key held in the respondent's possession. The respondent discovered suspicious discrepancies in electricity usage at the hotel. The respondent carried out a physical inspection of the meter at the hotel and discovered that it had been tampered with. The respondent alleged that the tampering had resulted in an under-recording of actual electricity usage at the hotel resulting in a revenue loss of RM637,697.62. The respondent sent several notices to the appellant demanding payment of RM637,697.62 as loss of revenue. The appellant refused to pay the amount and the respondent thus filed a civil suit in the High Court. The appellant counterclaimed against the respondent for a declaration that the respondent had no right to claim for the RM637,697.62 and sought damages for defamation arising from the several letters that the respondent had sent to the appellant. The High Court allowed the respondent's suit but dismissed the appellant's counterclaim with costs. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal against the claim for loss of revenue, but dismissing the appeal on the counterclaim:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> With regard to the counterclaim, the evidence and applicable law did not support a claim for breach of statutory duty or defamation, quite aside from the argument that breach of statutory duty was not pleaded. The respondent was merely exercising its powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 ("the Act")</LINK> in a situation where there was evidence of tampering of the TNB meter. In such circumstances, the court could not infer any <i>mala fide</i> act that was extortionate or oppressive on the part of the respondent. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The "ordinary reasonable person" would not draw the same inferences from the words used in the relevant letters of the respondent which were in essence demand letters in pursuit of a legal right, and therefore could not be defamatory. <i>Tun Datuk Patinggi Haji Abdul Rahman Ya'kub v. Bre Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors (folld)</i>. (paras 20-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> A prior prosecution and conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37 of the Act</LINK> is not a precondition to a loss of revenue claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of the Act</LINK>. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The evidence indicated that the TNB meter room was just outside the hotel's main building - next to the Lobby area - and it was kept under lock and key, with the key for access being kept by the respondent. It was not established on the evidence that any of the employees of the hotel had access, or could have had access, to the meter room. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The High Court judge, in accepting that the law did not require a prior prosecution and conviction to be had before a civil claim for loss of revenue under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) of the Act</LINK> be brought, failed to properly direct her mind further to consider that the respondent had still to prove the commission of a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK> offence by some party, and further to properly consider whether, where the tampering was done by a third party and not the appellant, what was exactly the loss suffered by the respondent and the gain enjoyed by the appellant. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The respondent had not proven its quantum of damages on a balance of probabilities. When all the evidence presented before the High Court was considered, and the evidence of both parties given proper and fair consideration, and balancing and testing the oral testimonies with the documents and the probabilities of the case, this court was of the opinion that the findings of the High Court could not be supported. (paras 30 &amp; 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The circumstances were such that there was sufficient evidence on which to raise an estoppel. The appellant was led to believe over that lengthy period of 22 months that everything was in order only to be later billed for more than half a million Ringgit for the alleged under billing. The respondent, by its own admission, had a sophisticated system of remote monitoring and yet it chose not to act promptly and remedy the alleged defects in the metering system. In the instant case, the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4) of the Act</LINK> was easily displaced on the evidence. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The High Court had rejected the argument on the unreasonableness of the calculation partly because it was not expressly pleaded. However, no objection appeared to have been raised when the witnesses were being cross-examined on this issue. In any event, the justice of the case should be a countervailing factor particularly when the High Court itself dealt with the issue in some detail only to reject the argument ultimately. There was no element of surprise or unfairness occasioned to the respondent by the inclusion of this additional ground. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> There were serious appealable errors on the appreciation of the evidence and the finding on the estoppel argument that required appellate intervention. (para 35)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A. Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, Nikmat Maju Development Sdn Bhd operates the Crystal Crown Hotel ("Hotel") in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, and was at all material times a registered user and consumer of the respondent, Tenaga Nasional Berhad, which supplied the electricity to operate the hotel. It was common ground that the installation of the electric meter (the TNB meter room) was within the premises of the hotel but under the control of the respondent and secured by lock and key held in the possession of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent had conducted a remote monitoring of the meter over a span of more than a year by which it discovered suspicious discrepancies in the usage of electricity at the hotel. This led to a physical inspection of the meter installation on 17 July 2008 by the respondent's investigation team. The meter was found to have been tampered with as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The inspection was conducted with the presence of the appellant's representative, DW2 (Azman bin Yusof). The meter was then corrected. The under-recording ceased thereafter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> According to the respondent, the tampering resulted in an under-recording or an error rate of -32.44% as against the actual usage of electricity by the hotel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Notices dated 18 November 2008, 13 February 2009, 3 April 2009 and 2 May 2009 were sent to the appellant informing it of the tampering of the recording of the supply of electricity to the appellant's premises and the appellant was required to pay RM637,697.62 being the amount which should have been paid between October 2006 and July 2008 (22 months) had the supply been correctly recorded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant refused to settle the payment of RM637,697.62 being the loss of revenue to the respondent and costs of electricity usage that had not been recorded in the meter reading from September 2006 to July 2008. Arising from this, the respondent filed the civil suit against the appellant in the High Court to recover this loss of revenue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>B. The Appellant's/Defendant's Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant mounted a vigorous defence denying the respondent had a right to demand for payment of the RM637,697.62 on a number grounds which can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>C. Counterclaim For Defamation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant filed a counterclaim against the respondent seeking a declaration that the respondent has no right to claim for the sum of RM637,697.62 and damages for defamation arising from the several letters that the respondent had sent to the appellant in the course of the threat to discontinue the supply of electricity and the demand that the appellant settle the sum claimed for the 22 months of alleged underbilling. In its counterclaim, the appellant averred that the respondent "published the ... words maliciously in that it knew they were false, (or) alternatively was reckless whether they were true or false, and intended thereby to injure the defendant in its said business" (para [13]).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In particular, the appellant referred to the "Notis pemotongan bekalan elektrik di bawah <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">subseksyen 38(1) Akta Bekalan Elektrik 1990</LINK>" dated 13 February 2009 which stated offences had been committed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37(1), (3) and (14) of that Act</LINK> in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>D. The High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The learned High Court Judge allowed the respondent's claim but dismissed the appellant's counterclaim with costs of RM50,000.00 awarded to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In summary, the High Court Judge found there was sufficient evidence to show tampering, as evidenced by:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The graph produced at trial (exh P3), derived from the remote monitoring system, clearly showed a disturbed pattern of electricity consumption from 9 August 2006 to 17 July 2008 which could only be attributed to meter tampering. Although the electricity substation was under the care and control of the respondent, it did not mean that nobody could not have physical access to it, since it was not guarded 24 hours a day. The learned judge stated in the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The learned trial judge observed that the written submission of the appellant was more concerned with the calculation of the loss of revenue than the issue of tampering, on the argument that the back billing must be done on the basis of the actual days of tampering and on the entire number of days from 1 October 2006 to 1 July 2008. The High Court held this was not a pleaded issue and the calculation was not unreasonable, since billing was done on a monthly, not a daily basis. The High Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Addressing the delay and failure on the respondent's part to take immediate action, the High Court was of the opinion that although the tampering was first discovered during a routine inspection on 13 September 2007, it had to place the hotel under close scrutiny through the remote monitoring system until the raid on 17 July 2008, stating:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> As regards the argument that the back billing could only be for a maximum of three months as allegedly provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1990_384;11.;;">reg 11(2) of the Licensee Supply Regulations 1990</LINK>, the High Court held that this provision did not apply in the context of tampering and a claim for loss of revenue. It applied in relation to meter inaccuracy, meter malfunction, incorrect meter reading, incorrect application of meter multiplier, cross-connection or faulty installation, ie it related to "acts of negligence" on the part of the plaintiff which led to an undercharging or overcharging.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On the issue whether a criminal prosecution and conviction for offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990</LINK> was a condition precedent to a civil suit being filed for recovery of loss revenue by the respondent under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38</LINK>, the High Court, in rejecting this argument, referred to and applied the decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_309;"><i>Claybricks &amp; Tiles Sdn Bhd lwn. Tenaga Nasional Bhd</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 309</LINK>; [2007] 1 MLJ 217; [2006] 4 CLJ 892; [2006] 6 AMR 741 which held that it was not a condition precedent. The High Court noted the rationale in <i>Claybricks &amp; Tiles (supra)</i>, which it was stated, "... <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(1) Akta</LINK> tersebut telah diperuntukkan secara spesifik untuk menjaga kepentingan TNB dan membolehkan TNB bertindak cepat dan dengan itu dapat mencegah penyalahgunaan seperti pencurian bekalan elektrik yang dibekalkan oleh TNB". The High Court in this instant appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant had tried to explain the discrepancies in the consumption of electricity were connected with low room occupancy during those periods, but the High Court explained that no supporting data was presented to the court and on the evidence the consumption of electricity had remained constant after the raid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> With reference to the counterclaim, the High Court held "breach of statutory duty" was not pleaded, and as for the counterclaim for defamation, the three notices said to contain alleged defamatory words were merely letters of demand for payment of the loss of revenue following the tampering of the meter and the respondent had the statutory right to pursue the civil suit to recover its losses. The letters themselves merely indicated the acts of tampering but did not directly accuse the appellant of the tampering. In particular, the respondent's letter dated 3 April 2009 was quoted by the learned High Court Judge. These were the relevant paragraphs emphasised in the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>E. Our Decision And Reasons</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We heard the appeal on 8 October 2013. We unanimously allowed the appeal on the main claim for loss of revenue but dismissed the appeal on the counterclaim, with cost of RM60,000.00 here and below awarded to the appellant. Our full reasons for the unanimous decision are elaborated below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> At the outset, we wish to state that as far as the counterclaim was concerned, we were in complete agreement with the findings and conclusions of the High Court. The evidence and the applicable law did not support a claim for breach of statutory duty or defamation, quite aside from the argument that breach of statutory duty was not pleaded. We agreed with the position taken by the High Court that the respondent was merely exercising its powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990</LINK> in a situation where there was evidence of tampering of the TNB meter. In such circumstances, how could the court infer any <i>mala fide</i> act that was extortionate or oppressive on the part of the respondent? On the claim for defamation, the approach to the construction of words alleged to be defamatory has been clearly laid down in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_4_877;"><i>Tun Datuk Patinggi Haji Abdul Rahman Ya'kub v. Bre Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1995] 4 MLRH 877</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 393, and this case was in fact cited by counsel for the appellant, in these terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The "ordinary reasonable person" will not draw the same inferences from the words used in the relevant letters of the respondent which were in essence demand letters in pursuit of a legal right, and therefore could not be defamatory. The position taken by the respondent was not so much that the appellant was the culprit who tampered with the meter, but more on the basis that in such circumstances it was entitled statutorily to claim for loss of revenue in its capacity as a utility company since the tampering benefited the appellant. We have emphasised earlier in this judgment the explanation afforded by the respondent, and we repeat the words used: "Pihak kami tidak menuduh mana-mana pihak tentang kejanggalan meter tersebut. Pihak kami cuma ingin menuntut balik hasil kerugian penggunaan elektrik kwh sahaja".</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue Of A Criminal Conviction Being A Pre-Condition</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Turning now to the main appeal on the issues raised in this connection, we were not persuaded by the appellant's argument in relation to a prosecution and conviction for a criminal offence being a precondition for a civil action for recovery of loss of revenue under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) of the Electricity Supply Act</LINK>, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The statutory formula in subsection (3) has been contrasted with that in subsection (1), dealing with disconnection of electricity supply, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Subsection (1) refers to "evidence" which in the "opinion" of a person employed by the licensee "proves that an offence has been committed" under any of the various sections under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK>, as opposed to the more positive "due to the offence committed" in subsection (3) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38</LINK>. It has therefore been argued in a line of High Court cases (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_12_461;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad v. Takatronics (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 12 MLRH 461</LINK>, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1453;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad v. JCY HDD Technology Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] MLRHU 1453</LINK>; [2013] 7 CLJ 799; [2012] 3 AMR 576 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2013_913;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Bhd v. EE-Lian Plastic Industries (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] MLRHU 913</LINK>; [2013] 8 MLJ 683; [2013] 2 CLJ 697) that a prior prosecution and conviction is required before a claim for loss of revenue under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3)</LINK> is commenced, unlike an act to disconnect an electricity supply to premises which requires only the formation of an "opinion" that an offence has been committed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> With respect, this line of case authorities must be read in the light of the Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_4_257;"><i>WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd v.

      <b>Recent Decision Of Court Of Appeal On Loss Of Revenue Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Subsequent cases by this court have also followed the reasoning in <i>Claybricks (supra), and WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>. We refer here to two decisions of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2014_258;"><i>Ichi-Ban Plastic (M) Sdn Bhd v. Tenaga Nasional Berhad</i> [2014] MLRAU 258</LINK> and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_2_471;"><i>Sumbang Projeks Sdn Bhd v. Tenaga Nasional Berhad</i> [2014] 2 MLRA 471</LINK>; [2014] 4 CLJ 323. In <i>Ichi-Ban Plastics (supra)</i>, for example, the Court of Appeal said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Having concluded that a prior prosecution and conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK> is not a precondition to a loss of revenue claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38</LINK>, it becomes necessary to determine whether the respondent has proven its claim on the civil burden and standard of proof of balance of probabilities. First of all, there has to be sufficient credible evidence of the commission of any of the offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK>. This is not something that can be conveniently assumed in the absence of convincing evidence where the burden of proof on the civil standard lies on the plaintiff. There must be evidence of tampering to serve as a foundation of the loss of revenue claim. The second issue that immediately intrudes is: who tampered with the meter installation? On the facts of this appeal, did the evidence point to the offence being committed by the appellant, or some other person? If the tampering was done by a third party, can the appellant be held fully accountable just on the basis that the appellant has reaped a benefit from it as against loss suffered by the respondent? Thirdly, if tampering is proven, whether by the owner of the premises or a third party has the calculation of losses been properly done? In other words, has the quantum of losses been established and proven on a balance of probabilities?</p>
    <p>
      <b>F. Our Evaluation Of The Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Upon considering the evidence in detail, we found several unsatisfactory aspects in the decision of the High Court, indicative of a failure of the trial court to conduct a proper judicial evaluation and appreciation of the evidence. For a start, there was a suggestion in the judgment to indicate that the appellant through one of its witnesses, DW2 (Azman bin Yusof), had agreed that there was tampering. See para (v) on p 11 of the judgment: "The physical evidence above is supported by the evidence of DW2, who agreed with the suggestion by plaintiff 's counsel that there was in fact tampering of the meter at the hotel". This conclusion is not borne out by the actual testimony of DW2, which we quote below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It can be seen from the exchange between counsel and the witness that the answers given by DW2 were very guarded and the allegation that he agreed there was tampering must be viewed in its total context. The questions and answers were specifically in relation to a document produced by the respondent which this witness acknowledged. Nevertheless, the evidence indicated that the TNB meter room was just outside the hotel's main building (next to the Lobby area) and it was kept under lock and key, with the key for access being kept by the respondent. See the evidence of PW1 (Mohamad Fardi bin Seliman):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was not established on the evidence that any of the employees of the hotel had access, or could have had access, to the meter room. DW1 (Khoo Chai Kaa), the Managing Director of the appellant, testified on this issue of access, and we quote the relevant part of this testimony:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> These were the unchallenged facts in this appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> With respect, in these circumstances we found that the High Court Judge, in accepting that the law did not require a prior prosecution and conviction to be had before a civil claim for loss of revenue under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3)</LINK> to be brought, failed to properly direct Her Ladyship's mind further to consider that the respondent must still prove the commission of a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK> offence by some party, and further to properly consider whether, where the tampering was done by a third party and not the appellant, what was exactly the loss suffered by the respondent and the gain enjoyed by the appellant. The evidence by the respondent's witnesses acknowledged that it was possible to calculate on basis of the exact days when the remote monitoring showed discrepancies and to exclude days when it showed normal readings. The trial judge too seemed to accept that technically it could be done, as shown in the passage in the judgment which has been cited earlier, reading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In the precise circumstances of this appeal, it looked patently unfair to bill the undercharged consumption on a monthly basis and not actual days for 22 months to arrive at the huge figure of RM637,697.62. Most businesses will be crippled by this sort of calculation, which, with respect and contrary to the trial judge's finding, on any proper evaluation of the facts must be regarded as an unreasonable calculation of the quantum of damages. In other words, the respondent has not proven its quantum of damages on a balance of probabilities. To allow the respondent to recover on the basis of their calculation will be to treat the alleged commission of a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK> offence as effectively an offence of strict liability with resultant punitive damages as compensation for the alleged loss of revenue, although the tampering was done by a third party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We provide below some excerpts from the evidence of the respondent's witnesses which proved how remote monitoring could be accurately done, the fact that there were discrepancies for only a few days in a month and how they responded to counsel's cross-examination that their method of calculation was unreasonable.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The testimony of the two important witnesses of the respondent confirmed he following crucial facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>G. Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> When all the evidence presented before the High Court was considered, and the evidence of both parties given proper and fair consideration, and balancing and testing the oral testimonies with the documents and the probabilities of the case, we were of the opinion that the findings of the High Court could not be supported. In the circumstances elaborated above, we believed there was sufficient evidence on which to raise an estoppel. The appellant was led to believe over that lengthy period of 22 months that everything was in order only to be later billed for more than half a million Ringgit for the alleged under billing. The respondent, by its own admission, had a sophisticated system of remote monitoring and yet it chose not to act promptly and remedy the alleged defects in the metering system. It is no answer to place the blame on the Suruhanjaya Tenaga for the delay for the simple reason that it would be unfair to impose liability on the customer by reason of the respondent's own lack of sense of immediacy. Why should it wait so long and yet be heard to complain that it was losing revenue? All said, the method of calculating the back billing was erroneous since the same sophisticated monitoring system could calculate the exact loss of revenue on a daily basis, and it was admitted by the respondent's witnesses that the discrepancies occurred for only several days in a month. Reference was made by the High Court to the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4) of the Electricity Supply Act 1990</LINK> whereby a written statement by an employee of the respondent specifying the amount of the loss of revenue and the person liable for the payment "shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence" of the payment due, but on the evidence this presumption, in our opinion, was easily displaced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The judgment of the High Court also rejected the argument on the unreasonableness of the calculation partly because it was not expressly pleaded. We have looked at the Notes of Evidence in some detail, but it did not appear any objection on this score was raised when the witnesses were being cross-examined on this issue. In any event, the justice of the case should be a countervailing factor particularly when the High Court itself dealt with issue in some detail only to reject the argument ultimately. There was no element of surprise or unfairness occasioned to the respondent by the inclusion of this additional ground.</p>
    <p>
      <b>H. Conclusion And Orders</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In conclusion, we were therefore of the opinion that there were serious appealable errors on the appreciation of the evidence and the finding on the estoppel argument that required intervention on our part. Consequently, we allowed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court in allowing the claim of the plaintiff. The judgment of the High Court on the plaintiff 's claim was set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We dismissed the appellant's appeal on the counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In these circumstances, we ordered costs of RM60,000.00 here and below to be paid by the respondent to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The deposit was ordered to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
