    <p>On 15 April 2013, the judgment creditor ("JC") issued a Bankruptcy Notice ("BN") against the judgment debtor ("JD") demanding payment of a debt based on a final judgment. The BN was served through Substituted Service pursuant to an Order for Substituted Service dated 26 April 2013. The Creditor's Petition ("CP") filed on 7 June 2013 was also served on the JD by way of Substituted Service. On 18 October 2013 the JD applied to set aside the bankruptcy cause papers and service of the same but the application was dismissed by the Senior Assistant Registrar ("SAR") leading the JD to appeal to the Judge in Chambers. On 21 April 2014, the JC applied to amend the CP by substituting the date of the act of bankruptcy from to 28 May 2013 to 30 May 2013. Leave to amend was given by the SAR and the JD further appealed to the Judge in Chambers. Both appeals were dismissed by the High Court. The appellant filed two appeals to the Court of Appeal. In the first appeal ("Appeal No: 85") the JD appealed against the dismissal of his application to set aside the bankruptcy cause papers and their service upon him. The JD raised the following issues in Appeal No: 85: (a) his (JD's) name and NRIC numbers were not inserted in the Request to Issue the Bankruptcy Notice rendering such Request invalid; (b) the Bankruptcy Notice and the CP were served at the wrong address; (c) there was a duplicity of bankruptcy proceedings; (d) the proceedings were nullified due to a failure to annex the Petition to the verifying affidavit; and (e) the letters of appointment to the JD failed to comply with Practice Note 1 of 1968 in that the documents to be served were not enclosed with the letters of appointment; and (f) the applications for substituted service were made by way of Notice of Application instead of by Summons in Chambers. In the second appeal ("Appeal No: 86"), the JD appealed against the High Court's affirmation of the SAR's decision to allow amendment of the CP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing Appeal No: 86 with costs; allowing Appeal No: 85 with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The misstatement of "28 May 2013" instead of "30 May 2013" as the date of the act of bankruptcy in the CP had not prejudiced the JD because the CP was filed on 7 June 2013, a period of seven days after the date of the act of bankruptcy was committed. Further, there was no evidence to show that as at the date of the act of bankruptcy (30 May 2013) the JD had made any attempt to satisfy the judgment debt or that the JD had any counterclaim, set off or cross demand. Thus, there was no substantial injustice caused by the error in the date of the act of bankruptcy. This was a proper case where <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;131.;;">s 131 of the Bankruptcy Act 1967 ("BA 1967")</LINK> could be invoked to regularise the CP. (paras 12-13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge found the two addresses complained of by the JD referred to the same unit number, road name and post code. The address was obtained from the National Registration Department of Malaysia. The JD's complaint was also contradicted by the fact that he had admitted to receiving a letter issued by the JC at the very same address that the JD complained was wrong. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The previous Bankruptcy Notice had been withdrawn and was no longer an issue before the SAR. There was thus no merit in the JD's argument. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There is no express stipulation to say that the requirement to annex the petition to the verifying affidavit is mandatory. Form 11 merely adverts to "the petition hereunto annexed". Thus the failure to annex the petition to the verifying affidavit was only a formal defect or irregularity. The defect was one which was curable within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;131.;;">s 131 of the BA 1967</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;274.;;">r 274 of the Bankruptcy Rules 1969 ("BR 1969")</LINK>. Thus, the bankruptcy proceedings were not rendered a nullity by the omission to annex the petition to the verifying affidavit. (paras 27-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The requirement to enclose the documents was provided in Practice Note 1 of 1968. In of itself, the omission to enclose the documents in the letters of appointment could be regarded as a formal defect or irregularity capable of being cured. In this instance, no substantial injustice had been occasioned by the omission on the part of the JC. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> There was a clear stipulation in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;18.;;">r 18(1) of the BR 1969</LINK> making it mandatory for an application to be filed by Summons in Chambers. The filing of a Notice of Application by the JC as opposed to a Summons in Chambers was a clear breach of a mandatory provision. The breach was not a mere irregularity or formal defect capable of being cured. The application was in a sense the originating process upon which the JC sought to obtain an order for substituted service. As such the wrong mode adopted by the JC undermined the very stratum of the application for substituted service itself and, consequently, any order obtained thereunder had to be equally tainted and rendered null and void. Thus, the applications for substituted service of the BN and the CP were invalid and ought to have been dismissed. Consequently, the Orders for Substituted Service of the BN and CP were null and void and ought to be set aside. (paras 38-39)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Vernon Ong JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Appeal No: 85 relates to the judgment debtor's application to set aside the bankruptcy cause papers and service of the same on him. The judgment debtor is appealing against the decision of the learned High Court Judge affirming the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar dismissing the judgment debtor's application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Appeal No: 86 relates to the judgment creditor's application to amend its Creditor's Petition. The judgment debtor is appealing against the decision of the learned High Court Judge affirming the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar in allowing the amendment of the Creditor's Petition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> As both appeals arose from the same bankruptcy proceedings they were heard together. For convenience, the appellant shall be referred to as the JD and the respondent as the JC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Antecedents Proceedings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The JC obtained summary judgment on 14 March 2012 against the JD for RM8,687,247.45 together with interest and costs. The summary judgment is a final judgment as the JD's appeal against the summary judgment has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 15 April 2013, a Bankruptcy Notice (BN) was issued against the JD demanding payment of the judgment debt. Service of the BN was effected by way of substituted service pursuant to an Order for Substituted Service dated 26 April 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The Creditor's Petition (CP) was filed on 7 June 2013 and also served on the JD by way of substituted service pursuant to an Order for Substituted Service dated 21 June 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 21 January 2014, the JC filed an application for leave to amend the CP by substituting "30 May 2013" for "28 May 2013" as the date of the act of bankruptcy as stated in para 5 of the CP. Leave to amend the CP was given by the Senior Assistant Registrar (SAR) on 26 March 2014. On 3 April 2014, the JD filed a Notice of Appeal to judge in chambers against the order of the SAR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 18 October 2013, the JD filed an application to set aside the bankruptcy cause papers and service of the same. On 24 March 2014, the SAR dismissed the JD's application. On 3 April 2014, the JD filed a Notice of Appeal to judge in chambers against the order of the SAR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Both appeals were heard together by the learned High Court Judge on 30 May 2014. On 26 June 2014, the learned High Court Judge delivered her decision dismissing both appeals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[Appeal No: 86]</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We propose to begin with the appeal relating to the amendment of the CP. It is the JD's contention that the application for amendment was not <i>bona fide</i> because the wrong date of the alleged act of bankruptcy stated in the CP was one of the issues raised by the JD to set aside/strike out the CP (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_417;"><i>Yamaha Motor Co Ltd v.

    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was also contended for the JD that the JC was estopped from amending the date of the act of bankruptcy in the CP. The JD first raised the "wrong date of the act of bankruptcy" in his affidavit to support his application to strike out the CP and the JC had denied in its affidavit in reply that the date of the act of bankruptcy stated in the CP was wrong (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_2_314;"><i>Teo Ah Bin v.

      <b>[12]</b> We do not think that the misstatement of "28 May 2013" instead of "30 May 201" as the date of the act of bankruptcy in the CP prejudiced the JD because the CP was filed on 7 June 2013, a period of seven days after the date of the act of bankruptcy was committed. Further, there is no evidence to show that as at the date of the act of bankruptcy (30 May 2013) the JD had made any attempt to satisfy the judgment debt or that the JD has any counterclaim, set off or cross demand. Accordingly, we agree with the learned High Court Judge's finding that there was no substantial injustice caused by the error in the date of the act of bankruptcy. This is a proper case where <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;131.;;">s 131 of the Bankruptcy Act 1967 (BA 1967)</LINK> could be invoked to regularise the CP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We, would, therefore dismiss Appeal No: 86 with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[Appeal No: 85]</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Five principal grounds of appeal were canvassed at the hearing of the appeal. They are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Whether The Request To Issue BN Is Invalid?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The first ground relates to the fact that the name and NRIC number of the JD was not inserted in the request to issue BN. We note that even though it was not inserted in the first paragraph of the request for issue of BN, the JD's name and NRIC number are inserted in the intitulement of the request. As such, there is no confusion or doubt as to the identity of the JD in the request. We would agree with the learned High Court Judge's finding that the irregularity did not invalidate the proceedings as no substantial injustice has been occasioned (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;131.;;">s 131 of BA 1967</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Service Of BN And CP Is Bad?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The second ground relates to service of the BN and CP on the JD's address. The JD's contention is that the cause papers were wrongly served at "B-022-04, Kiaramas Sutera 7, Jalan Desa Kiara, 50480 Kuala Lumpur" whereas his correct address is at "B-22-04, Kiaramas Sutera Condominium, 7, Jalan Desa Kiara, 50480 Kuala Lumpur." The learned High Court Judge found as a fact that the two addresses referred to the same place as the unit number, road name and post code are the same. Both addresses refer to Jalan Desa Kiara. Further, the address relied on by the JC is the address obtained from the National Registration Department of Malaysia. In contrast, the JD's contention is premised on an advertisement from Propwall the probative value of which is questionable. More significantly, the JD's stand is contradicted by the fact that he has admitted to receiving a letter dated 6 September 2013 issued by the JC to the very same address which he contends is the wrong address. For the foregoing reasons, we are in agreement with the findings of the learned High Court Judge on this issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether There Is Any Duplicity Of Bankruptcy Proceedings?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The third ground relates to the duplicity of bankruptcy proceedings. We have perused the Appeal Record and agree with the learned High Court Judge that the previous bankruptcy notice filed on 12 April 2013 had already been withdrawn and was no longer an issue before the Senior Assistant Registrar. As such, we do not see any merit in the JD's argument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether The Proceedings Are Nullified By The Failure To Annex The Petition To The Verifying Affidavit?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The fourth ground is more substantive. It deals with the question of whether the fact that a copy of the CP is not annexed to the Affidavit of Truth of Statements in Petition is fatal so as to nullify the proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;6.;;">Section 6(1) of the BA 1967</LINK> provides that a creditor's petition shall be verified by the affidavit of the creditor or of some person on his behalf having knowledge of the facts and shall be served. The manner in which the affidavit is required to be filed is set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;106.;;">r 106 of the Bankruptcy Rules 1969 ('BR 1969')</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The prescribed form for the verifying affidavit is Form No 11 which requires that the petition be annexed to it. This is evident from the opening paragraph of Form 11 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1992_2_190;"><i>Ooi Thean Chuan v. Banque Nationale De Paris</i> [1992] 2 MLRH 190</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 526; [1992] 3 CLJ 160, one of the objections taken by the judgment debtor was that the petition had not been verified by affidavit required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;6.;;">s 6(1) of the BA 1967</LINK> and Form 11 prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;106.;;">r 106 of the BR 1969</LINK> in that although the verifying affidavit was filed together with the petition, the petition was not annexed to the affidavit. Edgar Joseph Jr J (as he then was) held that the verifying affidavit prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;106.;;">r 106</LINK> is Form 11 which requires the petition to be annexed to it; the petition must be tied to or bound to or attached to or joined to or affixed to or stapled to the verifying affidavit, so as to avoid any dispute as to what exactly is being verified. The failure to do so goes beyond being a mere irregularity and amounts to something that renders the proceedings a nullity thereby sweeping away the jurisdiction of the court. The fact that no substantial injustice or no prejudice had been suffered by the debtor is beside the point and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;131.;;">s 131 of the BA 1967</LINK> is without application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b>
      <i>Ooi Thean Chuan (supra)</i> was followed in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2003_1_89;"><i>Cho Yu-Lon v. Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [2003] 1 MLRH 89</LINK>; [2003] 5 MLJ 289; [2003] 2 CLJ 186 where Kamalanathan Ratnam J held that a copy of the creditor's petition introduced as an exhibit to the affidavit and stapled to the affidavit would suffice to meet the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;106.;;">r 106</LINK> and Form 11.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b>
      <i>Ooi Thean Chuan (supra)</i> was also followed in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_11_488;"><i>Per: Dato' Dr Elamaran M Sabapathy; Ex-Parte: Rhb Bank Berhad</i> [2010] 11 MLRH 488</LINK> where the judgment debtor applied to set aside the bankruptcy notice and creditor's petition. It was contended, <i>inter alia</i>, that the affidavit verifying petition accompanying the creditor's petition had not had the petition annexed to it. Varghese George Varughese JC (later JCA) held that the verifying affidavit did not comply with the requirements of the BA 1967 and the BR 1969. The omission to annex the creditor's petition to the verifying affidavit was a matter which went to the materiality of contents and hence a substantive matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_2_155;"><i>Re Puan Sri Mona Kishu Thiratrai, Ex P Affin Bank Bhd</i> [2007] 2 MLRH 155</LINK>; [2007] 3 MLJ 223; [2007] 7 CLJ 657, Kang Hwee Gee J (later JCA) departed from the view taken by Edgar Joseph Jr J in <i>Ooi Thean Chuan (supra)</i>. His Lordship held that the purpose of Form 11 was merely to bring to the notice of the judgment debtor that the verifying affidavit had been annexed to the petition. If indeed the verifying affidavit and the petition had been brought to the notice of the judgment debtor that purpose would have been achieved. It is the substance not the form that matters. A minor infraction (even if proven) does not make the petition ineffective and bad.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> A similar issue arose in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_1_616;"><i>Teoh Thean Peng v. D &amp; C Leasing Sdn Bhd</i> [1993] 1 MLRH 616</LINK>; [1993] 2 MLJ 1; [1993] 2 CLJ 665 where <i>Ooi Thean Chuan (supra)</i> was referred to but not followed. KC Vohrah J (later JCA) held that the proceedings are not rendered a nullity even if the petition is not annexed to the verifying affidavit which has the same title and distinctive number as the petition does verify the statements in the petition with sufficient particularity. The verifying affidavit serves a limited purpose of enabling the Registrar to investigate the petition in order to decide whether to seal copies of the petition and once the copies are sealed for service it is clear that the Registrar adverted to the verifying affidavit for investigation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;108.;;">r 108 of the BR 1969</LINK> and that the affidavit must have borne the title and distinctive number borne by the petition itself unless the contrary can be shown.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> With respect, we think that <i>Teoh Thean Peng (supra)</i> is the better view. We agree with His Lordship's observation that in <i>Ooi Thean Chuan (supra)</i> Edgar Joseph Jr J's considered <i>Re Daunt</i> [1905] 5 SR (NSW) 553 and <i>Re Abrahamson</i> 22 ALR 749 both of which are Australian cases. In particular, the decision in <i>Ooi Thean Chuan (supra)</i> relied principally on a passage in the Tasmanian case of <i>Re Abrahamson</i> where Neasey J explained why it was necessary to annex a copy of the petition to the affidavit under s 52(1)(a) of the Australian Bankruptcy Act 1966 and stated that "it provides that at the hearing of a creditor's petition the court shall require proof of the matters stated on the petition but for that purpose may accept the affidavit verifying the petition as sufficient." His Lordship said at p 619 that "That was, however, not the position in England in relation to English Bankruptcy Act 1952 (now replaced by the Insolvency Act 1986) and the Bankruptcy Rules 1952 (BR) (now replaced by the Insolvency Rules 1986) (our Act and Rules were substantially modelled on the 1952 Act and Rules) ..." His Lordship also adverted to a passage from <i>Williams and Muir on Bankruptcy</i>, (19th edn) at p 56, which stated that the affidavit verifying petition cannot be used upon the hearing of the bankruptcy petition; reference being made to r 169 and Form 12 which corresponds substantially to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;122.;;">r 122</LINK> and Form 11 of the BR 1969. Therefore, the affidavit verifying petition cannot be used at the hearing of the bankruptcy petition (see also <i>Re a Debtor (7 of 1910)</i> [1910] 2 KB 59, 62).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;6.;;">Section 6(1) of the BA 1969</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;106.;;">r 106 of the BR 1969</LINK> which lays out the procedure for compliance are similarly worded. It is pertinent to note that there is no express stipulation to say that the requirement to annex the petition to the verifying affidavit is mandatory. Form 11 merely adverts to "the petition hereunto annexed". Accordingly, we hold that the failure to annex the petition to the verifying affidavit is only a formal defect or irregularity. Therefore, the defect is one which is curable within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;131.;;">s 131 of the BA 1967</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;274.;;">r 274 of the BR 1969</LINK> which are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Accordingly, we hold that the bankruptcy proceedings are not rendered a nullity by the omission to annex the petition to the verifying affidavit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Orders For Substituted Service Valid?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The last point relates to the validity of the orders for substituted service of the BN and CP. The JD's attack is premised on (i) the argument that the wrong mode of application was used by the JC for the application; and (ii) the letters of appointment dated 17 April 2013 and 13 June 2013 did not comply with Practice Note No 1 of 1968.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is contended that the applications were made by way of Notice of Application instead of Summons in Chambers in contravention of the mandatory provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;18.;;">r 18 of the Bankruptcy Rules 1969 (BR 1969)</LINK>. As bankruptcy proceedings are quasi-penal in nature, it is imperative that procedural requirements are complied with strictly. In support of this contention, learned counsel referred the following authorities: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_636;">Matthias Chang Wen Chieh v. American Express (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd [2012] 2 MLRA 636</LINK>, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_383;"><i>Development &amp; Commercial Bank Berhad v.

    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On this point, the learned High Court Judge referred to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;65;SN5.;;">O 65 r 5 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> which provides that an application for an Order for Substituted Service shall be made by notice of application. She found that as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;110.;;">r 110 of the BR 1969</LINK> on substituted service did not prescribe the mode of application, the applications made by way of Notice of Application are correct and regular.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;110.;;">Rule 110 of the BR 1969</LINK> gives the Bankruptcy Court power to order substituted service if it is satisfied by affidavit or other evidence on oath that prompt personal service cannot be affected because the debtor is keeping out of the way to avoid service of the petition or any other process. Whilst <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;110.;;">r 110</LINK> does not prescribe the mode of application for an order of substituted service, the mode of application is expressly stipulated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;18.;;">r 18(1) of the BR 1969</LINK> in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In <i>Mathias Chang (supra)</i>, the appellant applied by Notice of Motion to set aside the bankruptcy notice issued against him. The Court of Appeal upheld the respondent's preliminary objection that the application should be made by way of a summons in chambers and not by way of a notice of motion. At para [22], Abdul Malik Ishak JCA speaking for the Court of Appeal said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In <i>Ong Kian Seng (supra)</i>, the appellant bank issued a bankruptcy notice against the respondent debtor on an unsatisfied judgment debt pursuant to a final consent judgment. The bankruptcy notice was followed by the filing of a creditor's petition. The respondent debtor filed an affidavit opposing the creditor's petition contending that the bankruptcy notice was invalid as the interest specified was wrongly calculated. At the hearing of the petition, the appellant bank raised a preliminary objection that the respondent debtor's affidavit was not a proper notice to oppose the petition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;117.;;">r 117 of the BR 1969</LINK> as he was required to file a notice in Form 16 specifying the statements in the petition which he disputed. The judge overruled the objection and held that the affidavit was sufficient to give notice to the appellant bank of the respondent debtor's intention to oppose the petition and that the failure to file a notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;117.;;">r 117</LINK> was only a formal defect which did not cause substantial injustice to the appellant bank, relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;131.;;">s 131 of the BA 1967</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;274.;;">r 274 of the BR 1969</LINK>. The appellant appealed to the Federal Court on the grounds that the judge erred in law in treating the respondent debtor's affidavit as a notice to oppose the petition under r 177 of the BR 1969. The Federal Court held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;117.;;">r 117</LINK> clearly provides that a debtor shall file a notice specifying the statements in the petition which he intends to deny or dispute. The failure to file a notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;117.;;">r 117</LINK> supported by an affidavit cannot be excused as a mere formal defect. At p 387, Mohamed Dzaiddin Abdullah FCJ (as he then was) speaking for the Federal Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It is also contended that the order for substituted service is invalid and ought to be set aside for failure to comply with Practice Note No 1 of 1968 which is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In this instance, a perusal of the two letters of appointment in question show that the documents to be served were not enclosed; what was enclosed was a "surat jawapan" for the debtor to fill in the time and date for service to be effected. There is nothing in the affidavits of non-service affirmed by Mohd Rezal bin Idris on 25 April 2013 and 21 June 2013 respectively to show that the documents to be served were enclosed with the letters of appointment. Paragraph no 5 of the Practice Note stipulates that the second call shall be made by appointment by letter sent to the debtor enclosing a copy of the documents to be served.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We note that the requirements to enclose the documents are guidelines provided in the Practice Note. In of itself, the omission to enclose the documents in the letters of appointment may be regarded as a formal defect or irregularity capable of being cured. We do not see that substantial injustice has been occasioned by this omission on the part of the JC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We now return to the arguments on the correct mode of application. Applying the authorities cited above, it is settled law that the word "shall" is mandatory and thereby imposes an obligation to comply with what is required to be done. We do not consider that since <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;110.;;">r 110 of the BR 1969</LINK> is silent on the mode of application, the applications made by Notices of Application are correct and regular. There is a clear stipulation in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1969_199;18.;;">r 18(1) of the BR 1969</LINK> making it mandatory for an application to be filed by summons in chambers. In the circumstances, the filing of a notice of application by the JC as opposed to a summons in chambers is a clear breach of a mandatory provision. The breach is not a mere irregularity or formal defect capable of being cured. The application is in a sense the originating process upon which the JC seeks to obtain an order for substituted service. As such the wrong mode adopted by the JC undermines the very stratum of the application for substituted service itself and consequently, any order obtained thereunder must be equally tainted and rendered null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> On the aforesaid grounds we are constrained to hold that the applications for substituted service of the BN and the CP are invalid and ought to have been dismissed; and consequently, the Orders for Substituted Service of the BN and CP are null and void and set aside. Accordingly, the service of the BN and CP are set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In the result, Appeal No: 85 is allowed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We order that costs in respect of both appeals to be fixed at RM10,000.00. The deposits are ordered to be refunded.</p>
