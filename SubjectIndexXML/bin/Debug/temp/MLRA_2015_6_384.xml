    <p>This was the appellants' appeal against the decision of the High Court in allowing the respondents' application to quash the notices issued by an investigating officer of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission ('MACC') under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 ('the Act')</LINK>. The respondents were advocates and solicitors of the High Court of Malaya acting for their client who had been summoned by the MACC to give a statement to assist in the investigation of an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;16.;;">s 16(b)(B) of the Act</LINK>. During the meeting at the MACC's office, the respondents insisted on being present throughout the recording of their client's statement, as per their client's request. The MACC agreed to this request, however later the MACC requested to record statements from both the respondents. Upon their refusal, the notices were issued to both respondents. Consequently, the respondents succeeded in their application for judicial review seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the notices, a declaration that the notices were <i>ultra vires</i> and unenforceable, and a declaration that the MACC did not have the power to take statements or testimony of lawyers who appeared with their client who had been ordered to attend the MACC's office for the purpose of giving statements to the MACC. In this appeal, the appellants' submitted, amongst others, that the trial judge failed to consider or give any interpretation to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1) (a) of the Act</LINK>; based on the words 'in his opinion' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>, it was for the investigating officer to decide whether the person called to give evidence would assist in the investigation or not; and there was no evidence that the issuance of the notice requiring the attendance of the respondents to assist in the investigations was done otherwise than in good faith.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appellants' appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In construing a provision in the Act, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>, what must prevail is a construction that promotes the purpose of the Act. Accordingly, the word 'person' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">30(3)(a)</LINK> included both witness and suspect. In this case, the trial judge found that the respondents were neither witnesses nor suspects as the respondents only accompanied their client at the statement recording. There was no evidence whatsoever to show that the respondents were either potential witnesses or suspects. It was clear from the affidavits of the appellants that the only reason the MACC wanted to examine the respondents was because the respondents had insisted on being present at their client's statement recording. (<i>Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan &amp; Ors v. Tan Boon Wah (refd)</i>). (paras 13-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Although the words 'in his opinion' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a)</LINK> gave an investigating officer the discretion to decide, nonetheless, the discretionary power in deciding whether to call a person was not an uncontrolled discretion to call any person. It was a stringent requirement that the discretion should be exercised for a proper purpose, and that it should not be exercised unreasonably. Where the discretion was wrongly exercised, it was the duty of the courts to intervene. Therefore, the High Court in a judicial review application was duty bound to consider whether the power under which the officer acted was improperly exercised. (paras 16-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The trial judge found that other than the undisputed fact that the respondents were present during the interview of their client, there was no evidence that they had in fact interfered with the interview. Further, the officer failed to have regard to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;46.;;">s 46 of the Act</LINK> which protected privileged information or communication between the respondents <i>qua</i> solicitors and their client. In the circumstances, the issuance of the notices was clearly an act of intimidation and abuse of powers on the part of the appellants. Accordingly, the issuance of the notices was not done in good faith and there was no legal basis for the issuance of the notices. (paras 19-22)</p>

      <b>Vernon Ong JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal relates to the power of an officer of the Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission (MACC) investigating an offence to examine persons under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (Act 694)</LINK>. On 17 November 2014, we dismissed the appeal after hearing submissions from learned counsel for the parties. We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The two respondents are advocates and solicitors of the High Court of Malaya. They acted for one Datuk Shamsubahrin bin Ismail who was summoned by the 1st appellant (the MACC) to give a statement to assist in the investigation of an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;16.;;">s 16(b)(B) of Act 694</LINK>. On 19 March 2012, the respondents accompanied their client to MACC's office. On their client's instructions the respondents insisted on being present throughout the recording of their client's statement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The MACC agreed to the respondents being present during their client's statement taking. However, the MACC informed the respondents of the possibility that the respondents' statements would also be recorded. After their client's statement was taken, the MACC informed the respondents that they wanted to record their statements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As the respondents refused to give any statement, the MACC served on each of the respondents a notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a) of Act 694</LINK> ("the Notices") requiring them to be present at the MACC office on 23 March 2012 to be examined orally and for their statements to be recorded. They were also notified that failure to comply with the Notices may subject them to punishment of a fine or imprisonment or both.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondents filed an application for judicial review seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the Notices, a declaration that the Notices are <i>ultra vires</i> and unenforceable, and a declaration that the MACC does not have the power to take statements or testimony of lawyers who appear with their client who has been ordered to attend the MACC's office for the purpose of giving statements to the MACC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned judge allowed the respondents' application and made the order of <i>certiorari</i> and declarations sought. The findings of the learned judge are predicated upon the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>MACC's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Before us, the learned counsel for the appellants argued that the learned judge failed to consider or give any interpretation to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a) of Act 694</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Firstly, the learned counsel submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a) of Act 694</LINK> empowers an officer of the MACC investigating an offence to order any person to attend before him for the purpose of examination if the officer is of the opinion that it may assist the investigation. It provides that any person may be so ordered, and does not preclude anybody for the purpose of assisting in the investigation. A person who may be ordered to attend pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a)</LINK> may be a witness and/or a suspect (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_568;"><i>Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan &amp; Ors v. Tan Boon Wah </i>[2010] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 193; [2010] 6 CLJ 142).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Secondly, whilst <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)</LINK> empowers an officer to conduct his investigation into an offence, the words "in his opinion" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">subsection 30(1)(a)</LINK> indicate that it is an empowering provision coupled with the discretionary powers to act in the manner prescribed in subsection 31(1)(a). It is for the investigating officer to decide whether the person called to give evidence will assist in the investigation or not; the court should not usurp the power given to the Investigation Officer by forming its own opinion on this matter (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;37.;;">s 37 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The interpretation that would promote the purpose and object of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;;">Act 694</LINK> is that the examination of any witnesses whenever the occasion arises that the examination will assist the investigation (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17.;;">s 17 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_277;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Bhd v. Ong See Teong &amp; Anor </i>[2009] 3 MLRA 277</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 155; [2010] 2 CLJ 1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Thirdly, there is no evidence that the issuance of the Notices requiring the attendance of the respondents to assist in the investigations, was done otherwise, than in good faith. There is no evidence to show that it was an act of intimidation and an abuse of power warranting the Notices to be rendered void and unlawful. As such, the appellants are protected from any civil suit under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;72.;;">s 72 of Act 694</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;46.;;">Section 46 of Act 694</LINK> is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">Section 30 of Act 694</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On the appellants' first point, we concur with the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan &amp; Ors v. Tan Boon Wah (supra) </i>that in construing a provision in an Act, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>, what must prevail is a construction that promotes the purpose of the Act. Accordingly, the word 'person' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">30(3) (a)</LINK> includes both witness and suspect. Thus, a person who may be ordered to attend pursuant to a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a)</LINK> notice may be a witness and/or a suspect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We do not think that the learned judge failed to consider this point. What the learned judge found was that the respondents were neither witnesses nor suspects. The respondents only accompanied their client at the statement recording. There is no evidence whatsoever to show that the respondents are either potential witnesses or suspects.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is clear from the affidavits of the appellants that the only reason the MACC wanted to examine the respondents was because the respondents had insisted on being present at their client's statement recording.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The appellants' second point relates to the exercise of discretion by an officer in deciding whether the person called to give evidence will assist in the investigation or not. We agree with the interpretation that the words 'in his opinion' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;30.;;">s 30(1)(a)</LINK> give an officer the discretion to decide.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Be that as it may, the discretionary power in deciding whether to call a person is not an uncontrolled discretion to call any person he likes. It has been said ofttimes that every legal power must have legal limits. It is also well-settled that it is a stringent requirement that a discretion should be exercised for a proper purpose, and that it should not be exercised unreasonably. In exercising his discretion, the officer must have regard to all relevant considerations and disregard all improper considerations. Where the discretion is wrongly exercised, it is the duty of the courts to intervene (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_132;"><i>Pengarah Tanah Dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd </i>[1978] 1 MLRA 132</LINK>; [1979] 1 MLJ 135).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In this instance, the High Court in a judicial review application is duty bound to consider whether the power under which the officer acts, a power which normally confers a broad discretion has been improperly exercised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> This brings us to the appellants' third point. The learned judge found that other than the undisputed fact that the respondents were present during the interview of their client, there is no evidence that they had in fact interfered with the interview.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We also agree with the observation of the learned judge that the officer had failed to have regard to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;46.;;">s 46 of Act 694</LINK> which protects privileged information or communication between the respondents <i>qua</i> solicitors and their client. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;46.;;">Section 46 of Act 694</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is abundantly clear that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;46.;;">s 46</LINK> requires an application to be made to a judge of the High Court before an advocate and solicitor can be ordered to disclose information available to him. More significantly, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2009_694;46.;;">subsection 46(2)</LINK> categorically excludes any privileged information or solicitor-client communication.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In the final analysis, we are in complete agreement with the learned judge that in the circumstances of the case, the issuance of the Notices is clearly an act of intimidation and abuse of powers on the part of the appellants. The respondents were present at their client's statement recording in their capacities as legal representatives of their client. There is nothing to indicate that the respondents are potential witnesses or suspects. Accordingly, the issuance of the Notices was not done in good faith. There is no legal basis for the issuance of the Notices.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> For the foregoing reasons, the appeal was dismissed with no order as to costs.</p>
