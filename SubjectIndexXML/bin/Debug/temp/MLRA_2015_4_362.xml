    <p>The appellant and respondent had married each other earlier through a civil marriage. Following his conversion to Islam on or around 26 November 2012, the appellant also converted the two children of the marriage without the knowledge and consent of the respondent. On 15 May 2013, the appellant obtained a Syariah Court Order dissolving the civil marriage between the appellant and the respondent. On 28 August 2013 the appellant obtained a temporary custody order over the children from the Syariah Court which order was made final on 19 September 2013. The respondent was not informed of the proceedings for the orders of the Syariah Court. The respondent herself petitioned the High Court for an order that her civil marriage with the appellant be dissolved and also for the custody of the two children of the marriage. One of the respondent's grounds for divorce was the appellant's conversion to Islam. The High Court allowed the respondent's petition on 7 April 2014 prompting the appellant to appeal against that part of the order granting <i>inter alia</i> custody, care and control of the children to the respondent and against the order prohibiting the appellant from harassing the respondent or the children. The issue was whether the High Court had jurisdiction to grant the respondent <i>inter alia</i>, the custody order.</p>
    <p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 7 April 2014, the High Court of Seremban gave Order In Term of the respondent's petition in encl 2 which the order include <i>inter alia</i>, that the civil marriage between the appellant and the respondent be dissolved and decree nisi be made absolute with immediate effect. The respondent was also given the custody, care and control of the children with reasonable access given to the appellant on every Sunday from 9.00am until 6.00pm under the supervision of the respondent at the respondent's premises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This is the appellant/husband's appeal against part of that decision given by the High Court on 7 April 2014. In his notice of appeal dated 11 April 2014, the appellant appealed against the order giving custody, care and control of the children to the respondent as well as against the order giving access to the children at the respondent's premises on every Sunday from 9.00am to 6.00pm under the supervision of the respondent. The appellant also appealed against: (a) the order prohibiting the appellant, the appellant's family members or any third party having connection or relationship with the appellant from harassing the respondent, the children or any family members of the respondent at any time; (b) the order preventing the appellant or the appellant's family member or any third party having connection or relationship with the appellant from taking out the children from the respondent's premises or the premises of the respondent's parents or from the children school during school hours; (c) the order directing the appellant to pay a monthly maintenance of RM500.00 for the benefit of the two children and that the payment be credited directly into the respondent's personal bank account; (d) the order preventing the appellant from executing any instrument or document related to the children, and that such document should only be executed by the respondent. Finally, the appellant is also appealing against the award of cost of RM5,000.00 which is payable within 30 days from the date of the order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The issue in this case is whether the civil High Court at Seremban has jurisdiction to grant the custody order and later on 21 May 2014, upon a separate application by the respondent in encl 37 before the High Court to grant the recovery order of the children against the appellant. The recovery order of 21 May 2014 is a subject matter of another appeal, ie Appeal No: N-02-1004-06-2014.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondent petitioned the High Court at Seremban vide an originating summons seeking <i>inter alia</i>, an order that her civil marriage to the appellant under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">Law Reform (Marriage And Divorce) Act 1976</LINK> be dissolved and also for the custody of the two children of the marriage namely Sharmila a/p Viran - female eight years old and Mitran a/l Viran - male, five years old at the material time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The material facts of this case have been succinctly appraised by the learned High Court Judge in her written judgment. We shall not repeat them here except to refer to the facts where and when are necessary for the purpose of this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> One of the grounds for the divorce is that the appellant has embraced Islam and has become a Muslim convert. Following his conversion to Islam on or around 26 November 2012, the appellant also converted the two children to Islam purportedly without the knowledge and consent of the respondent. The respondent found out about this fact on 4 April 2013 when she went to Pusat Dakwah Islamiah in Paroi, Seremban for a verification on the conversion. The appellant also upon his and the children conversion to Islam had taken the children from their respective school and put them at Pusat Dakwah Islamiah Seremban.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Then, on 15 May 2013 the appellant obtained the Syariah Court Order dissolving the civil marriage between the appellant and the respondent, and on 26 August 2013 the appellant obtained a temporary custody order over the children from the Syariah Court which order was made final on 19 September 2013. The respondent was not informed of the proceedings for the orders of the Syariah Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Opinion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We noted that the Syariah Court Seremban had granted the dissolution of the civil marriage between the appellant and the respondent pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_2004_011;46.;;">s 46(2) of the Islamic Family Law (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 2003 ("Enactment 2003")</LINK> which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Our view is that, the Syariah Court has no jurisdiction to grant the dissolution of the civil marriage between the appellant and the respondent. One of our reasons for saying so is that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_2004_011;45.;;">s 45 of the Enactment 2003</LINK> provides that Syariah Court can only grant orders pertaining to divorce or allows the pronouncement of the talaq by the husband where the marriage is registered or deem to be registered under the Enactment or that the marriage was solemnised in accordance to the Syariah law. The civil marriage between the appellant and respondent was neither solemnised in accordance with Syariah law nor registered under the Enactment. It was a marriage that was solemnised and registered under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>. This issue also has been canvassed and decided by the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_3_81;"><i>Subashini Rajasingam v. Saravanan Thangathoray &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2007] 3 MLRA 81</LINK>; [2008] 2 MLJ 147; [2008] 2 CLJ 1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In that case, the learned Justice Abdul Aziz Mohamad FCJ held at paras 141 and 144 that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In <i>Subashini Rajasingam (supra)</i>, several questions were put to the Federal Court for determination. Two of the questions for determination in that case, that are relevant for our purpose are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The Federal Court answered both questions in the affirmative. We in the Court of Appeal is bound by the decision of the apex court on the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>. Therefore, the jurisdictional issue as to the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court to hear matters on the dissolution of civil marriage and any ancillary matters thereto can now be put to rest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> However, in this appeal, though as we have found out that the Syariah Court has no jurisdiction to pronounce the dissolution of the civil marriage between the appellant and the respondent, the parties in the appeal before us are not questioning or challenging that decision. This is because we think that the parties are happy with the decision and had wanted the divorce all along.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The principal challenge as to the jurisdiction in this appeal by the appellant is that the High Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the custody order of the children to the respondent and to give the other ancillary order as well.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The main ground advanced by the appellant to support this contention is that the two children have converted to Islam before the filing of the petition and the conversion is valid under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;12.;;">art 12(4)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. Furthermore, it was argued that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_351;1.;;">s 1(3) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961 (Act 351)</LINK>, the civil court is deprived to hear guardianship and custody matter when the subject matter and the parties are Muslims. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;12.;;">Article 12(4) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And cl 3 of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;12.;;">art 12</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_351;1.;;">Section 1(3) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> There is no evidence to show that the legislature of the State of Negeri Sembilan had passed any law to adopt the application of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_351;;">Guardianship of Infants Act 1961</LINK>. Therefore, the provisions of the Act do not apply to Muslims in Negeri Sembilan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We find no merit in the above argument. In <i>Subashini (supra)</i> the child had also been converted to Islam at the time the High Court heard the application for custody. Yet, the Federal Court ruled that the High Court has the jurisdiction to hear the application and to grant the custody order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We have perused the judgment of the learned High Court Judge and we could not find any discussion by the learned High Court Judge on the issue whether the court has jurisdiction to hear the custody issue as opposed to the issue of dissolution of civil marriage when the two children and their father, ie the appellant have been converted to Islam. In fairness to the learned High Court Judge, Her Ladyship in an effort to justify that she has jurisdiction had referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_1_306;"><i>Shamala Sathiyaseelan v. Dr Jeyaganesh C Mogarajah</i> [2004] 1 MLRH 306</LINK>; [2003] 6 MLJ 515; [2004] 3 CLJ 516; [2004] 5 AMR 75, where the fact shows that the defendant in that case and the two children had embraced Islam before the originating summons in that case was filed. Before the High Court a preliminary objection was raised by the defendant that the High Court no longer has jurisdiction over the defendant and the two children by reason of their conversion to Islam. However, the preliminary objection was dismissed by the High Court. The reason given by the High Court was that the validity of the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant in that case was still subjected to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;8.;;">s 8 of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>. And that the plaintiff's application there was related to the right of custody and welfare of the children and maintenance. The High Court opined that the plaintiff would not run away from her responsibility to support the children, and that the civil marriage still subsists until dissolves under any circumstances under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;8.;;">s 8 of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>. And therefore, the defendant in that case was still subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court. The learned High Court Judge in this case (the subject matter of the appeal) also referred to the Federal Court case of Subashini Rajasingam (supra) which held that "A non Muslim marriage did not automatically dissolve upon one of the parties conversion to Islam. Thus, by contracting the civil marriage, the husband and wife were bound by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">1976 Act</LINK> in respect of divorce and custody of the children of the marriage, and thus, the civil court continued to have jurisdiction over him, notwithstanding his conversion to Islam."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The other argument raised by the appellant in this appeal is in relation to the position of Islam as the religion of the Federation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. The thrust of this argument is that since Islam is the religion of the Federation, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> imposes obligation upon the Federation to protect, defend, safeguard the Islamic religion, assist, enable and facilitate Muslims to practice Islam and give effect to or enforce Islamic injunctions spiritual and mundane. It was argued that by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3</LINK>, Islam is one of the important basic structures of the Federal Constitution and therefore the full intent and purpose of Islam as the religion of Federation must be given real and practical effect, throughout. Citing the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_292;"><i>Mamat Daud &amp; Ors v. The Government Of Malaysia</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 292</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 119;[1988] 1 CLJ 197, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that "based on this element of basic structure of the Federal Constitution, the Federal Government cannot directly or indirectly legislate on matters which the 'pith and substance' of it relates to Islam". It was thus argued by the appellant that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_351;;">Guardianship of Infants Act 1961 (Act 351)</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;">Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>, clearly conform to the position that Acts of Parliament do not encroach into Islamic matters reserved exclusively, by the Federal Constitution, for the States, in incorporating exclusion clauses for those Acts of Parliament, not to apply to Muslims or to be in opposition to any Islamic/Syariah laws. It was submitted therefore that this court must give due regard and uphold the basic structure of the Federal Constitution by not usurping the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court reserved solely for the Syariah Court by the Federal Constitution. It was further argued, flowing from the above argument that, regardless of the contents of those phrases in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Para 1</LINK>, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">List II</LINK>, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_2004_011;61.;;">s 61(3)(b) of administration of the Religion of Islam (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 2003</LINK>, which provide that the Syariah Court shall have civil jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions and proceedings if all the parties in the action or proceeding are Muslims, they will be to no avail to negate the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court in the subject matter of this case being the custody of Muslim children at the time of the dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Our understanding of this submission by learned counsel for the appellant which is that, reading <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;3.;;">s 3(3) of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK> and together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_351;1.;;">s 1(3) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961</LINK> in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> that Islam being the religion of the Federation, the High Court cannot grant the custody order of the children to the respondent by relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;51.;;">s 51(2) of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>. This is because as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant, the Court must give effect to the intent and purpose of putting Islam as the religion of the Federation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3 of the Constitution</LINK>. Accordingly, learned counsel for the appellant urged upon us to rule that <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1988_1_657;"><i>Che Omar Che Soh v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1988] 1 MLRA 657</LINK>; [1988] 2 MLJ 55, was no longer a good law because in that case having expressed the view correctly in defining the meaning of Islam or Islamic religion in not being "just a mere collection or dogmas and rituals but it is a complete way of life covering fields of human activities, may they be private or public, legal, political, economic, social, cultural, moral or judicial", the Supreme Court in that case had restricted the meaning of Islam being a religion of the Federation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> as to what was intended by the framers of the Constitution in that it is narrowly confined to the law of marriage, divorce and inheritance only. The other reason for this submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant is that Che Omar Che Soh (supra) was a decision before the introduction of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the Constitution</LINK> and the decision in that case is not applicable for situation post <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[21]</b> We must say that the learned counsel for the appellant had marshalled the above argument with great ingenuity. But, we have two short answers to the argument. Firstly, <i>Che Omar Che Soh (supra)</i> is a Supreme Court decision. It is binding on us being the Court of Appeal, a court inferior to the Supreme Court on the doctrine of stare decisis. We are in no position to overrule <i>Che Omar Che Soh (supra)</i> being a Supreme Court decision. However, in a proper case we may distinguish the facts in <i>Che Omar Che Soh (supra)</i> and thereby not to apply the principle therein. But in the present appeal the appellant had not shown any reason or grounds for us not to follow <i>Che Omar Che Soh (supra)</i>. Secondly, the argument raised by the appellant in relation to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> had also been discussed in Subashini (supra) with regard to the jurisdiction of the civil High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;3.;;">s 3(1)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_164;;51.;;">s 51 of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976</LINK>. In Subashini (supra) the husband who was the respondent before the Federal Court also argued that <i>Che Omar Che Soh (supra)</i> is no longer a good law because the Supreme Court in that case make two grave errors, the same argument that was raised before us in this appeal. We will answer this argument by echoing the words of the learned Abdul Aziz Mohamed FCJ at para 152 of His Lorship's judgment in <i>Subashini (supra)</i> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We therefore find no merits in the argument by the learned counsel for the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> For the above reasons, we will dismiss the appeal with cost, and we order cost in the sum of RM10,000.00 to be paid by the appellant to the respondent. We also order that the deposit be refunded to the appellant.</p>
