    <p>The 2nd appellant was a church, while the 1st appellant was the President of the Church. For the religious education of the children of the members of the Church, the appellants had brought in seven titles of publications from Indonesia ("the publications"). The publications were detained by Customs. Following that, the 1st appellant's request and appeal for the return of the publications were denied. The appellants then filed an application in the High Court for leave to apply for judicial review, seeking the following reliefs; an order for <i>certiorari</i> to quash the decision of the Minister of Internal Security ("the Minister") to refuse the importation and to withhold delivery of the publications; an order for <i>mandamus</i> to direct the Minister to return the publications to the appellants; and for several declarations ("the said declarations"), which concerned the appellants' and/or their congregations' constitutional right to use the word "Allah" in the Bahasa Malaysia and/or Bahasa Indonesia translations of the Bible as well as in all religious publications and materials ("all other publications"). Sometime in January 2008, the publications were released to the appellants. Accordingly, the appellants withdrew the application in respect of the reliefs for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>. In the High Court, the respondents objected to the application for leave due to the fact that the publications had been released, and argued that the subject matter of the judicial review was now rendered academic. The trial judge dismissed the appellants' application by relying on the finding of the Court of Appeal in <i>Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors v. Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur</i> that the word "Allah" was not an integral part of the faith of Christianity. In this appeal, the appellants submitted, <i>inter alia</i>, that the application for judicial review consisted of two parts, ie the first part of the application was in respect of the reliefs for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> to release the publications, while the second part related to the said declarations for all other publications; that in the light of the majority judgment of the Federal Court in <i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors</i>, the High Court was no longer bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in the said case; that it was perfectly in order for the applicant in a judicial review application to seek relief for the said declarations only; and that the role of the High Court at the leave application stage was only to see if the application disclosed an arguable case and was not frivolous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The application for judicial review before the trial judge did consist of two parts. Hence, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the first part of the application, the second part of the application remained in dispute. Accordingly, the issue contained in the prayers for the said declarations which pertained to the use of the word "Allah" in all other publications was still alive. Therefore, the submission that the application for leave for judicial review was rendered academic and was an exercise in futility was devoid of merit. (paras 10-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The finding of the Court of Appeal that the word "Allah" was not an integral part of the faith of Christianity had been ruled as a mere obiter by the Federal Court in <i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors</i>. In the circumstances, the basis for the decision of the trial judge was no longer sustainable. In any event, the application before the trial judge concerned a church in Sabah where native Bumiputra Christians had been using the word "Allah" for many generations in all aspects of the profession and practice of their Christian faith. Further, there was non-existent in Sabah any State law enacted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;11.;;">art 11(4) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> to prohibit the use of the word "Allah". (<i>Kerajaan Malaysia &amp; Ors v. Tay Chai Huat (refd)</i>). (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the appellants had properly sought the said declarations in their application for judicial review. The application for the said declarations was made jointly with the application for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>. The fact that the prayers for an order for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> were withdrawn did not affect the application. Furthermore, the said declarations could be granted by the court in appropriate cases even if it was not prayed for jointly or in the alternative with other remedies. (<i>Sivarasa Rasiah v. Badan Peguam Malaysia &amp; Anor (folld)</i>). (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant appeal, the appellants were naturally threatened by the act of the respondents and the appellants were facing legal uncertainty insofar as all other publications were concerned. Applying the pronouncement of the Federal Court in <i>Datuk Syed Kechik Bin Syed Mohamed v. Government Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i>, it was appropriate for the appellants to apply for the said declarations in respect of all other publications. (paras 20-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> This appeal was in respect of an application for leave for judicial review where the threshold was very low. There was no necessity to go into the merits of the case at the leave stage. The test was to see whether the appellants had an arguable case and that the application was not frivolous. In this instance, the appellants had passed the threshold for leave to be granted. (<i>Tang Kwor Ham &amp; Ors v. Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd &amp; Ors (refd)</i>). (para 22)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The factual matrix of this appeal is as follows. The 2nd appellant is a church incorporated under the Trustees Incorporation Ordinance (Sabah Cap 148) while the 1st appellant is the President of the Church.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> For the religious education of the children of the members of the Church, the appellants brought in seven titles of publications from Indonesia. The publications which consist of Sunday School materials were detained by the customs officer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The 1st appellant's request and appeal for the return of the publications were denied. In a letter dated 24 October 2007 (the said letter), the Ministry of Internal Security explained the basis of the decision as follows (pp 134-136: Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 10 December 2007, the appellants filed an application in the High Court at Kuala Lumpur for leave to apply for judicial review, seeking for the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Sometime in January 2008, the publications that were detained were released to the appellants. The application in respect of the reliefs for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> was accordingly withdrawn by the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In the High Court, learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) objected to the application for leave on the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In a five-paragraph judgment, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the application for leave. For ease of reference, we reproduce below the judgment of the learned judge:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Against the decision of the High Court, the appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal. Before us, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In response, learned SFC repeated the objections advanced in the High Court. It was further submitted by learned SFC that the relief of declaration sought on all other publications concerns the appellants' future rights which ought not to be granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that the application for judicial review before the learned High Court Judge consists of two parts. The first part relates to the prohibition on the publications that were detained by the respondents which had eventually been released, while the second part relates to the general prohibition on all other publications. The second part of the application is founded on para 12 of the said letter of the Ministry which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> As stated by the learned trial judge, the appellants prayed for 22 reliefs in the judicial review application. Following the release of the publications by the respondents, the appellants withdrew two of the prayers, namely the prayers for an order for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>. There are other prayers in relation to all other publications which had not been withdrawn by the appellants. Hence, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the first part of the application, the second part of the application which was premised on the respondent's decision to prohibit the use of the word "Allah" in all other publications remain in dispute. We therefore agree with the learned High Court Judge that the issue contained in the prayers for declarations which pertain to the use of the word "Allah" in all other publications is still alive. We note that there was no cross appeal by the respondents on the ruling of the High Court that the issue of declaration sought by the appellants is still alive. The submission of learned SFC that the application for leave for judicial review has been rendered academic and is an exercise in futility is thus devoid of merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In not granting leave to the appellants, the High Court had relied on only one ground, namely that it held itself bound by the Court of Appeal's decision in the Herald's case. In <i>Herald</i>'s case, the Court of Appeal had stated that the word "Allah" is not the essential or integral part of the religion of Christianity (see <i>Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors v. Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur, supra</i> at pp 31-32 and 56).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The finding of the Court of Appeal that the word "Allah" is not an integral part of the faith of Christianity had been ruled as a mere obiter by the Federal Court (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_205;"><i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 205</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 765; [2014] 6 CLJ 541 at p 230). In the circumstances, we find that the basis for the decision of the learned High Court Judge is no longer sustainable (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2012_1_501;"><i>Kerajaan Malaysia &amp; Ors v. Tay Chai Huat</i> [2012] 1 MELR 501</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_661;">[2012] 1 MLRA 661</LINK>; [2012] 3 MLJ 149; [2012] 3 ILJ 135; [2012] 3 CLJ 577). In any event, as submitted by learned counsel for the appellants, the application before the learned High Court Judge concerns a church in Sabah where native Bumiputra Christians have been using the word "Allah" for many generations in all aspects of the profession and practice of their Christian faith. Further, there is non-existent in Sabah, any state law enacted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;11.;;">art 11(4) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> to prohibit the use of the word "Allah" as opposed to nine other states which had enacted state laws on the prohibition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On whether the appellants, having withdrawn the reliefs for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> are barred from seeking declaration, learned SFC relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 2(2) of the RHC</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was submitted by learned SFC that in the light of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 2(2) of the RHC</LINK>, declaratory relief cannot be sought on its own in an application for judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We find that the appellants had properly sought for the relief of declaration in their application for judicial review. The application for declaration was made jointly with the application for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>. The fact that the prayers for an order for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> were withdrawn does not affect the application. In any event, declaration may be granted by the court in appropriate cases even if it was not prayed for jointly or in the alternative with other remedies as decided by this court in the case of <i>Sivarasa Rasiah, supra</i>, at p 149:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Further, we are mindful of the predicament of the appellants if they were to proceed against the respondents under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 16 of the RHC</LINK> for a declaratory judgment. In Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri (supra), the appellant commenced a writ action against the respondents rather than an application for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the RHC</LINK>. The appellant had sought for a declaration that his dismissal by the respondents is void and of no effect and that he is still a government officer in the said Ministry. The writ and the statement of claim was struck out by the High Court on the ground that it was an abuse of process of the court. The appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> On appeal to the Federal Court, the order of striking out was affirmed. The Federal Court states, at p 545:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Given the Federal Court decision, we find that the suggestion by learned SFC that the appellants should seek declaratory relief against the respondents under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 15 r 16 of the RHC</LINK> is not tenable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On the objection raised by learned SFC that the declarations sought for by the appellants concern future rights, we find guidance in the decision of the Federal Court in the case of <i>Datuk Syed Kechik (supra)</i>, where the appellant had applied for a declaration, among others that he is a person belonging to the State of Sabah in accordance with the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1975_155;;">Immigration Act 1959/63</LINK>. The learned High Court Judge in that case declined to grant the declaration sought on the ground that the application was premature and that the matter would be more appropriately dealt with under the special machinery provided by the Immigration Act. The appellant appealed to the Federal Court. In allowing the appeal the Federal Court states at p 519:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In the instant appeal, the appellants are naturally threatened by the act of the respondents and the appellants are facing legal uncertainty insofar as all other publications are concerned. Applying the pronouncement of the Federal Court above, we find that it is appropriate for the appellants to apply for the order of declaration in respect of all other publications.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Finally, we take note that this appeal is in respect of an application for leave for judicial review where the threshold is very low. There is no necessity to go into the merits of the case at the leave stage. The test is to see whether the appellants had an arguable case and that the application is not frivolous (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_698;"><i>Tang Kwor Ham &amp; Ors v. Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 698</LINK>; [2006] 5 MLJ 60; [2006] 1 CLJ 927; [2002] 3 AMR 2686). We find that the appellant had passed the threshold, for leave to be granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We therefore unanimously allow the appeal with no order as to costs. We set aside the decision of the High Court dated 5 May 2014. The case is remitted to the High Court for the High Court to hear the application in relation to the reliefs prayed for in prayers 2(c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m) (n) (o), (p), (q), (t), (u) and (v) at pp 70-77of Rekod Rayuan Jilid 1.</p>
