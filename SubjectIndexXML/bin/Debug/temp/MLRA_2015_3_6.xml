    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant and the 1st respondent executed a memorandum of undertaking in Hong Kong ("MOU") whereby the 1st respondent agreed <i>inter alia</i>, to sell to the appellant the entire issued shares in the 2nd respondent. In breach of the MOU, the 1st respondent had refused to execute a formal sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") or to accept part-payment of the purchase price. The appellant sued the 1st respondent for <i>inter alia</i>, specific performance of the SPA or alternatively damages <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance. The High Court however dismissed the appellant's claim for specific performance and instead awarded damages <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance. The High Court also dismissed with costs, the appellant's claim against the 2nd and 3rd respondents. The appellant filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal against some parts of the High Court's judgment. The appellant's appeal was basically limited against the decision to disallow specific performance against the 1st respondent. The 1st respondent thereafter filed a notice of cross-appeal in the Court of Appeal against the order for damages <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance. The grounds were <i>inter alia</i>, that the High Court judge had erred in deciding that the MOU had constituted a valid and binding contract between the appellant and the 1st respondent for the sale and purchase of the shares in the 2nd respondent. When the appeal was called, counsel for the appellant raised a preliminary issue for determination, concerning the scope or extent of matters that could be rightfully pursued under a cross-appeal. Counsel for the appellant submitted that since the appellant's appeal was limited to the refusal of specific performance, the 1st respondent's cross-appeal ought to be similarly limited to that issue. It was argued that the 1st respondent ought to have filed a notice of appeal if its complaint concerned the High Court's finding that there existed a valid and binding contract.</p>

      <b>(1)</b> The words "should be varied ... specifying the grounds thereof...." in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;8.;;">r 8 of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994 ("RCOA 1994")</LINK> and the words "to be varied to the extent" in Form 2 of the RCOA 1994 did not carry a meaning that <i>Leisure Farm Corporation Sdn Bhd v. Kabushiki Kaisha Ngu &amp; Ors</i> there could be a total or wholesale setting aside or review of the substantive judgment or findings of the court. The extent of any contention under a crossappeal, was to be limited to a modification or some slight difference to be made to that part of the judgment appealed against. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;5.;;">r 5 of the RCOA 1994</LINK>, if a substantive finding of the court was intended to be attacked, it behoved the party aggrieved to file a proper notice of appeal. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the appellant being satisfied as to the finding of fact that there was a binding contract but dissatisfied that no specific performance had been ordered, was appealing only against a part of the judgment, namely that the court ought to have in all the circumstances allowed the relief of specific performance of the contract rather than damages <i>in lieu</i> thereof be recovered from the 1st respondent. Any cross-appeal by the 1st respondent that could be pursued was thus limited to the dissatisfaction with the damages <i>in lieu</i>, the further damages and costs. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> For all intents and purposes the effect sought by way of the 1st respondent's cross-appeal was to set aside the finding that there was a 'concluded contract'. This could only be pursued by the 1st respondent filing a proper and separate notice of appeal within the one month allowed for an appeal to be lodged. The 1st respondent was precluded in the course of advancing its cross-appeal from raising any argument that there was no valid and concluded contract as held by the High Court judge.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> When this appeal was called, counsel for the appellant raised a preliminary issue for determination by us, before the parties were heard further. The question posed was as to the scope or extent of matters that could rightfully be pursued under a cross - appeal, in this case, within the purview of the notice of cross-appeal dated 15 April 2014 filed by the 1st respondent in the matter of the appeal of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It was pointed out to us that the appeal before us was only against part of the judgment of the High Court of 11 March 2014. It was contended by the appellant that 1st respondent's cross-appeal should be restricted to vary that part of the order that was being appealed and not be permitted to seek to reverse any other aspects of the decision of the High court. If the latter had been the intention of the 1st respondent, then, it was submitted that, a notice of appeal itself as against the substantive orders that the 1st respondent complained or was aggrieved about had to have been filed within the deadline fixed for appeals to be lodged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Having heard the parties, we were of the view that the cross-appeal of the 1st respondent was in effect and for all intents and purposes seeking to set aside or reverse a substantive decision of the High Court which was not the subject of the appellant's appeal here.</p>
    <p>Given that context, the 1st respondent ought to have filed a notice of appeal before expiry of the stipulated one month from the date of delivery of the High Court's decision. This had not been done and accordingly the 1st respondent was precluded from canvassing arguments against that substantive decision not appealed against by the appellant in the first place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We now set out the grounds for holding so. In these grounds only such of the facts and issues in the principal suit as are material or necessary in respect of our aforesaid ruling are reproduced or referred to. The appellant was the plaintiff and the 1st respondent was the 1st defendant at the High Court proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In so far as the 1st respondent was concerned, the material allegations of the appellant in the suit were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The reliefs sought by the appellant as against the 1st respondent were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The judgment of court of the 11 March 2014 given after the trial of the appellant's action (and the counterclaim of the 3rd respondent), were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 12 March 2014, the appellant filed a notice of appeal against only some parts of the decision of the learned judge (and not the whole). The English translation of the notice of appeal in its material parts are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 15 May 2014 (that is, after the Record of Appeal had been filed by the appellant), the 1st respondent's solicitors filed the now contentious notice of cross-appeal, the English translation of which is set out here:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the grounds of the judgment subsequently issued on 20 May 2014, the learned judge stated that the appellant had proved their case on a balance of probabilities against the 1st respondent. The relevant passage from the grounds was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Further down in the grounds of judgment, it was also stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> With regard to the appellant's prayer for specific performance the learned judge noted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was obvious that the learned judge had as a matter of fact found that there had come into existence a valid and binding contract between the 1st respondent and the appellant for the sale and purchase of all shares in the 2nd respondent (whose assets included the Golf Course Land) and premised on that specific finding, the court had opted to order compensation <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance, rather than grant the order for specific performance sought by the appellant.</p>
    <p>The appellant's appeal was basically limited against the learned judge's decision refusing the order for specific performance, notwithstanding that a concluded and binding contract had been found proven on the evidence in favour of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellant's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The thrust of appellant's submission on this preliminary issue was that since the appellant appeal vis-a-vis the 1st respondent was limited to the refusal of specific performance, the 1st respondent's cross-appeal must be similarly limited to that issue. The 1st respondent could not be heard on other matters not raised in the original appeal (In <i>Re Cavander's Trus</i>t [1881] 16 Ch D 270).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was submitted pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;8.;;">r 8 of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994 ("RCOA 1994")</LINK> and the specified Form 2 of the RCOA 1994, the 1st respondent was limited to vary such part of the order of court which was subject of the appeal. The 1st respondent was precluded therefore from challenging any other substantive finding of fact, including as was being attempted here to set aside or overturn the finding of the court that there existed a valid and binding contract between the 1st respondent and the appellant. We were referred to grounds set out under (b) in the notice of cross - appeal and also to the overall tenor of the written submissions now filed for the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was argued that the 1st respondent ought to have filed a notice of appeal if their complaint was as to the finding of the court that there existed a contract and wished to have this reversed. Such a notice of appeal had to be filed and served within one month of the decision. The 1st respondent was, in any case, clearly out of time when the cross-appeal was filed to pursue this line of contention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>1st Respondent's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Counsel for the 1st respondent sought to dismiss the appellant's objections as merely a technical one, and pointed out that the notice of cross-appeal complied substantially with the requirements found in Form 2. It was submitted that the target of the cross-appeal was to vary the three orders set out in para (a) of the notice of cross - appeal and the grounds for the same included the contention that the learned judge had erred in holding that there was a valid and binding contract between the 1st respondent and the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was also highlighted to us that when the decision was delivered in court, there was no specific order or pronouncement made by the learned judge to the effect that there was a valid and binding contract by virtue of the HK MOU. This only surfaced when the grounds of judgment was subsequently issued. If there was such a declaration or pronouncement, then perhaps the 1st respondent would have been obliged to file a notice of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> It was also submitted that the term 'vary' found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;8.;;">r 8</LINK> and Form 2 was wide enough to encompass within its meaning an intention to 'substantively amend' or even to 'set aside' the order or judgment appealed from.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Counsel for 1st respondent also sought to distinguish or limit the observation of the court in <i>Re Cavander's Trust (supra)</i> and submitted that an independent notice of appeal was only required in situations where there was a 3rd party not party to the proceedings itself involved in the appeal. Counsel contended that this was the comment on Re Cavander's Trust made by the Ontario Court of Appeal (Canada) in <i>Bandur et al v. Daiken et al</i> [1967] 1 QR 629-639. Our Decision</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;8.;;">Rule 8 of RCOA 1994</LINK>, in so far as was material for our consideration was in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The operative part of Form 2 was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It was also pertinent to have in mind the rules of procedure pertaining to notice of appeals itself. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;5.;;">Rule 5</LINK> stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;6.;;">Rule 6 of RCOA 1994</LINK> required such notice of appeal to be served on all parties directly affected by the appeal or their solicitors respectively. No appeal however shall, except by leave of the court, be brought after the expiration of one month from the date on which the judgment or order appealed against was pronounced (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;12.;;">r 12</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In our assessment, the answer to the issue posed to us would turn on the meaning to be assigned to the critical words used, namely, '... should be varied ... specifying the grounds thereof.' and 'to be varied to the extent' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;8.;;">r 8</LINK> and Form 2 respectively of RCOA 1994. The word 'vary' by itself was stated in the 'The Concise Oxford Dictionary' to mean- "change, make different, modify". In our considered view, those words used did not carry with it a meaning that there could be a total or wholesale setting aside or review (of the substantive judgment or any findings of the court); the extent of any contention under a cross-appeal, in our scenario here, was to be limited to a modification or some slight difference to be made to that part only of the judgment appealed against. This was borne out by the terminology used - '... varied to the extent ...' clearly pointing to a limitation of sorts in the scope of the matters to be advanced by way of the cross-appeal, that is, those words being given an ordinary and natural reading.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> This was also consistent with the scheme of things, as we viewed it, envisaged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;5.;;">r 5 RCOA 1994</LINK>. There it was provided for an appeal to be lodged against the whole or part of any judgment or order of court and such an appeal (in contrast to a cross-appeal) was by a re-hearing. The word 're-hearing' used here clearly anticipated a review or regurgitation before the appeal court of all the points and arguments taken at the court below. Hence if it was the substantive finding of the court that was intended to be attacked, it behoved upon the party aggrieved to file a proper notice of appeal. (Form 1 of RCOA 1994 also refers.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In the cross-appeal here the 1st respondent was seeking to 'set aside' (it will be noted) the specific orders listed as (a)(i), (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) in the notice of cross-appeal that had been made against the 1st respondent relying on the grounds as set out in (b) in the notice of cross-appeal. Counsel for the 1st respondent nevertheless agreed with us that the underlying intention and the submissions to be advanced in furthering the cross-appeal before us would be to show that the learned judge had erred when Her Ladyship found that there was a valid and concluded sale and purchase agreement between the 1st respondent and the appellant. Counsel's contention was that although the effect of such a position would be to have the whole or the substantive part of the decision of the learned judge set aside, it still fell within a 'variation' of the court judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We could not agree with this rather skilful attempt by counsel for the 1st respondent to explain away why a notice of appeal was not filed if the 1st respondent was not satisfied and did not agree with the finding of the court that there was in existence a valid contract between the 1st respondent and the appellant. The orders of the court that the 1st respondent pay damages <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance (and further damages for expenses incurred and costs) without a doubt flowed directly from or was consequential to the principal finding that there was a binding contract between the 1st respondent and the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The 1st respondent, having argued the case during the trial that there was no such contract concluded between the parties, and further having notice of the plaintiff 's alternative prayer for damages <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance of the contract in the pleaded case of appellant, ought to have known what formed the very foundation of the orders made by the learned judge; there was no reasonable basis to assert that a 'pronouncement' to that effect had to be specifically made by the court on 11 March 2014.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Even if the court's finding that there was such a valid and binding contract between the 1st respondent and the appellant was only evident from the grounds of judgment subsequently issued, we must state that the grounds were available on 20 May 2014 and the 1st respondent could well have applied for an extension of time to file a proper notice of appeal. Their failure to be vigilant in that respect could not in our view, be rectified by sneaking in through the process of cross-appeal to mount an attack as now intended on a material aspect of the judgment of the lower court, which was not the subject of the appeal itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In this case the appellant (being satisfied as to the finding of fact that there was a binding contract but dissatisfied that no specific performance had been ordered) was appealing only against a part of the judgment, namely that the court ought to have in all the circumstances allowed the relief of an order of specific performance of the contract rather than that damages <i>in lieu</i> thereof be recovered from the 1st respondent. Given that was the scope of the appeal itself, any cross-appeal by the 1st respondent that could be pursued was necessarily limited, as to the dissatisfaction with the damages <i>in lieu</i> (to be assessed), the further damages in the sum of RM841,691.94 and costs of RM150,000.00 ordered against the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We were fortified in the stand we had taken above by what was ruled by Jessel MR in <i>Re Cavander's Trust (supra)</i>. We were of the view that the principle stated there was not merely restricted to a situation where another party (other than the appellant was involved) but it laid down the rule that any cross-appeal must relate directly to the appeal brought by the appellant; otherwise there ought to be a separate notice of appeal filed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We also had for reference the decision of the court in <i>National Society for Distribution of Electricity by Secondary Generators v. Gibbs</i> [1900] 2 Ch 280 (which was one of the cases referred in <i>Bandur et al (supra)</i>). It was held there that where a defendant appealed on the dismissal of his counterclaim, a cross notice to vary (under O 58 r 6 -  Rules of the Supreme Court 1875, as in <i>Re Cavander's Trust</i>) can only be available in connection with that appeal and cannot encompass a totally distinct matter, such as the relief sought by a plaintiff on his independent claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In the <i>Secondary Generator v. Gibbs case (supra)</i> Lindley MR had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> If need to be clarified that under the scheme of things prescribed by the then English Order LVIII, appeals to the Court of Appeal were to be brought by notice of motion in a summary way and it was not necessary for a respondent to give notice of motion by way of cross-appeal if the respondent intended upon hearing of the appeal to contend that the decision of the court below should be varied, provided the respondent within the time specified gave notice of such intention to all parties affected by such contention.</p>
    <p>Hence appeals were to be brought by way of notice of motion to appeal and in respect of any cross-appeal to vary that decision of the court being appealed against, the respondent was only required to give notice of such intention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> For purposes of comparison, the said Order LVIII r 1 and r 6 are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> One can easily see the similarity between our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;5.;;">r 5 RCOA 1994</LINK> and the said r 1 of Order LVIII; in our case the appeal against whole or part of the judgment was to be by the filing of a "notice of appeal" while the appeal under the then English procedural regime was to be by way of filing a 'notice of motion to appeal'. In the case of a cross-appeal to vary on the other hand, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;8.;;">r 8 of RCOA 1994</LINK> required a 'notice of cross-appeal' to be filed while under the then r 6 of Order LVIII, no 'motion by way of cross-appeal' was required so long as notice of intention to vary was given. In other words, the 'notice of cross - appeal' required under our RCOA 1994 took the place of the 'notice of intention to vary' in the then English rules which featured in the <i>Secondary Generator v. Gibbs case (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> For the reasons elaborated above, we found merit in the contention of the appellant. For all intents and purposes the effect sought by way of the 1st respondent's cross - appeal was to set aside the finding of the court that there was a 'concluded contract'. This could only be pursued by the 1st respondent <i>Leisure Farm Corporation Sdn Bhd v. Kabushiki Kaisha Ngu &amp; Ors</i> 20 by filing a proper and separate notice of appeal within the one month allowed for an appeal to be lodged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Accordingly, we ruled that the 1st respondent was precluded in the course of advancing its cross - appeal from raising any argument that there was no valid and concluded contract as held by the learned judge in the court below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Due to the serious ramifications arising from this ruling, the respondents requested for an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal to obtain further instructions of their respective clients. We allowed the same.</p>
