    <p>The appellant, Network Pet Products (M) Sdn Bhd ('NPP'), was a company incorporated in Malaysia and in the business of trading and manufacturing of pet products. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, Royal Canin SAS ('RCSA'), was a company incorporated in France and in the same business as NPP. In 1996 the said parties entered into an oral agreement in which it was agreed that NPP would supply RCSA's pet food products bearing the trademark name "Royal Canin". In 2003 the said parties executed a written agreement in which RCSA appointed NPP as its exclusive distributor for its products in Malaysia and Brunei. The written contract was for an initial period of two years commencing on 1 January 2003 and ending on 31 December 2004. Thereafter the contract was renewable yearly subject to RCSA's vetting and approval of NPP's business plans on the minimum sales target for the relevant year. When the written contract term expired on 31 December 2004, the parties continued with the relationship without executing any renewal agreement. The parties then continued with the business relationship until December 2007. After December 2007 there were no business plans issued by NPP for RCSA's vetting and approval. The contract was renewed on a yearly basis by the conduct of the parties until 21 October 2011 when RCSA terminated the business relationship giving NPP a nine-month notice until 31 July 2012. RCSA also set up the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent, Royal Canin Malaysia Sdn Bhd ('RCM'), as its representative office in Malaysia. Aggrieved, NPP brought this injunctive action against RCSA and RCM disputing RCSA's entitlement to terminate their long-standing contractual relationship by virtue of a de facto oral partnership arranged between their representatives in 2008. It was alleged that the parties thereafter had conducted their relationship without adhering to the terms of the written contract on the requirements of business plans and yearly minimum sales target. NPP also claimed for conspiracy to injure and wrongful interference with trade, alleging that the incorporation of RCM was to allow RCSA to enter the Malaysian market to be the distributer of the products. As a consequence thereof, NPP not only lost the benefit of the partnership but also the profits derived from the sale of the products. The High Court dismissed NPP's claim against both RCSA and RCM on the ground that RCSA should not be restrained from distributing its own products which were in its trademark name. The High Court also allowed RCSA's counterclaim for damages for passing off on NPP's alleged unauthorised use of RCSA's Royal Canin mark on NPP's Facebook page, which allegedly led to confusion to customers of RCSA, ordering further that the Facebook account be deactivated. NPP now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal in part:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The question was whether there was an oral partnership agreement on the facts seen against the requirements of a partnership under the partnership law. The evidence advanced by NPP based on the oral testimony of its primary witness, PW1, was contradictory and unsupported by the contemporaneous documentary evidence. Also, in assessing whether a partnership existed, the intention of the parties must be considered and in the absence of a written agreement, reliance must be placed on the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_135;;">Partnership Act 1961</LINK>. The sharing of profits which was absent herein, was a very relevant indicia recognised by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_135;4.;;">s 4 of the Partnership Act 1961</LINK>. So too was the relevance of art XV of the Distributorship Contract. It was evident that the attempt to prop up an oral partnership agreement flew in the face of that clear provision which constituted an "entire agreement" clause. (paras 25-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> As for conspiracy and wrongful interference, it was important to prove that the "predominant purpose" was to injure NPP and injury was thereby caused. On the facts, it could not be said there was such a "predominant purpose". The non-renewal of the distributorship was within the discretion of RCSA. The notice period of nine months was reasonable since the concern of NPP was in part the expenditure incurred in renting the warehouse concerned in Puchong. However, that lease expired on 30 September 2012. In any event, once NPP failed to substantiate the existence of the alleged oral partnership agreement, the claims for conspiracy and wrongful interference consequentially could not stand. (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The trial judge, in not finding that the evidential burden had shifted to RCSA and RCM to call the relevant representatives as witnesses for the allegedly oral partnership agreement, and in drawing an adverse inference against NPP for not calling those witnesses, had not committed a fundamental error so as to have wholly vitiated the High Court judgment. The penultimate burden of proof on the standard of balance of probabilities lay with NPP to prove the existence of the oral partnership. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> related to a mere presumption of fact that evidence which could be and was not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who withheld it. There must be evidence of a conscious "withholding" of that evidence. That condition was not satisfied since the relevant witnesses who were the employees of RCSA at the material time, ceased being RCSA's employees when the case came to be heard. There was also evidence that RCSA had tried calling them as witnesses and asked the court for time to do so, which was refused. As such, an adverse inference could not be drawn against RCSA. Ultimately, the burden was with NPP under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">s 101 of the same Act,</LINK> which NPP failed to discharge. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The essential ingredients of the tort of passing off were not established by RCSA and RCM as pleaded in their counterclaim. The evidence did not support any inference that the Royal Canin mark was being used to pass off as NPP's mark so as to create confusion in the market. RCSA failed to adduce any evidence on the probability of damage to their goodwill and reputation. The identification of the mark was throughout with RCSA. RCSA also knew of the Facebook page and took some time to protest, which was sufficient evidence of acquiescence on RCSA's part. By the time the High Court delivered its decision, the Facebook page was deactivated. Hence, the counterclaim should be dismissed. (para 32)</p>

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A. Parties And Brief Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal concerned a termination of a commercial relationship that spanned a period of 15 years from 1996 until October 2011. In 1996, the appellant, Network Pet Products (M) Sdn Bhd ("NPP"), the plaintiff in the High Court, was appointed as the exclusive distributor for Malaysia and Brunei by Royal Canin SAS ("RCSA"), the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant below and the1<sup>st</sup> respondent in this appeal, of RCSA's pet food products. RCSA is a company incorporated in France. The 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant below, Royal Canin Malaysia Sdn Bhd ("RCM"), is the locally incorporated company of RCSA, having been incorporated on 9 March 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The letter of termination sent by RCSA to NPP and signed by its President (Jean Christophe Falin) is dated 21 October 2011, and it reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Although a nine months' notice of termination was given, NPP pleaded that this letter was issued "in breach of the Terms of Partnership" (see para [35] of the statement of claim).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> NPP based its claim against RCSA on a breach of an alleged oral partnership and maintained that the nine months' notice was an inadequate notice for the termination. As against RCSA and RCM, NPP claimed damages for "conspiracy to injure" and "inducing breach of contract and unlawful interference" with NPP's business.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The business relationship began in 1996 when RCSA's representative in the Asia-Pacific region, Luc Cuinet, invited NPP, through its director and shareholder, Shanmuganathan (PW1), to be RCSA's exclusive distributor for Malaysia and Brunei. There was initially no written contract entered into, and this informal business relationship lasted from 1996 to 2003. In 2003, however, a written contract of distributorship was entered into between RCSA and NPP. This written contract was initially for a duration of two years and made renewable for a period of one year each, subject to the approval of RCSA and the fulfilment of minimum sales target for each year to be agreed between the parties. The contract was renewed yearly and business plans and sales targets were set for the years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. There were no formal renewals of the contract for 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, until the notice of termination was given on 21 October 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It was NPP's position that from 2008 onwards NPP and RCSA operated as a de facto partnership, which was brought about by a discussion between their representatives in January 2008. According to NPP, RCSA's representative in Malaysia, Philippe Estiot, had represented as such to NPP's representatives, and the parties had thereafter conducted their relationship without adhering to the terms of the earlier written contract on the requirements of business plans and yearly minimum sales target.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> With the termination of the relationship, RCSA's products were distributed by its own locally incorporated company, ie RCM.</p>
    <p>
      <b>B. The Pleaded Case And Reliefs</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> As pleaded, the reliefs claimed, based allegedly on damages to NPP's business and reputation, were stated in the following manner in para [58] of the statement of claim:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The reliefs pleaded as quoted above were fundamentally anchored on the premise that a partnership had existed between NPP and RCSA since 1 January 2008, and that had allegedly been unlawfully terminated, hence the claim for an account of profits from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant since 1 Janaury 2008. The reliefs prayed against RCM, on the other hand, was related to the conspiracy to injure and wrongful interference with trade arguments. Thus, NPP pleaded that RCM furnish NPP with an account of profits made by it since RCM's date of incorporation, ie 9 March 2012, in addition to restraining RCM from interfering with, or inducing the existing customers of NPP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C. Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The High Court dismissed NPP's claim against both RCSA and RCM. The High Court also allowed a counterclaim by RCSA against NPP, awarding RM20,000.00 damages for the tort of passing off. This was in respect of an alleged unauthorised use of the Royal Canin mark in a Facebook page opened by NPP which led to confusion to customers of RCSA. The High Court further directed that the Facebook account be deactivated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>D. Decision In This Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In this appeal, which was allowed in part, we dismissed NPP's appeal and affirmed the judgment and orders of the High Court with respect to NPP's claim against RCSA and RCM, but allowed NPP's appeal in relation to the counterclaim and set aside the judgment and orders on the counterclaim. We therefore agreed with the findings and conclusions of the High Court on the main claim that NPP had failed to prove the existence of the alleged oral partnership between NPP and RCSA on a balance of probabilities, and further failed to prove the alleged tort of conspiracy to injure and inducing breach of contract. We did not agree, however, with the findings and conclusion with regard to the counterclaim on passing off since the evidence disclosed RCSA was aware of the activation of the Facebook account from the start and had allowed it to continue. In any event, the alleged confusion in the use of the Royal Canin mark simply did not exist. There was no confusion in the use of the mark in trade in the traditional sense of passing off. The mark was used as denoting products belonging to RCSA. There was no attempt to pass off RCSA's products as NPP's products. In any event, by the time the case was heard and disposed, the offending Facebook account had been deactivated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>E. Summary Of Grounds Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> As appears in the judgment of the High Court, the learned High Court Judge referred to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_135;3.;;">ss 3(1)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_135;4.;;">4</LINK> of the Partnership Act 1961, noted that a partnership is defined as "the relationship which subsists between persons carrying on business in common with a view to profit" and that one of the indicia of partnership is the sharing of profits, and further that a court must look at the totality of the facts to determine the intentions of the parties whether a partnership was intended, finally decided that NPP had failed to prove the relationship between NPP and RCSA was a partnership, stating that it was "nothing more than a union of commercial convenience within the parameters of the contracts of distributorship" (pp 17-19 of the judgment). The High Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In allowing the counterclaim by RCSA, the High Court noted that the crux of the counterclaim was the unauthorised setting up of a Facebook account by NPP under the name of "Royal Canin Malaysia" without the consent of RCSA, and NPP continued to use this "trade style" even after the notice of nonrenewal of the distributorship contract was sent. Finding all the three elements of passing off established (the existence of goodwill and reputation of RCSA, misrepresentation by NPP in the course of trade, and damage or likelihood of damage resulting from that misrepresentation), the High Court was satisfied that NPP had clearly misrepresented itself to be the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant by setting up the Facebook account under the trade style "Royal Canin Malaysia" without the consent or authorisation of RCSA, resulting in confusion to customers as evidenced by the comments posted on the Facebook. The High Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>F. The Submissions In The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>NPP's Arguments</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In this appeal, the submissions of the appellant may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The thrust of the submissions was on the purported existence of the de facto partnership post-2008. We quote below that part of NPP's written submission bearing on this argument:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>RCSA's And RCM's Arguments</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The respondents argued that this appeal involved a simple case of an alleged breach of a distributorship agreement. The argument that it involved a de facto partnership agreed to orally was an afterthought that was raised for the first time in the statement of claim and not borne out by the contemporaneous documents. Reference was made to art XVII of the Distributorship Agreement which provided for renewal "for consecutive periods of one year, subject to approval of Royal Canin SA and acceptance of minimum sales target for the year to come by both parties". There were thus two conditions which had to be fulfilled - (a) approval by RCSA and (b) acceptance of minimum sales target for the subsequent year by both parties. DW4 (Francois Gergaud), the President of the Asia Pacific Region of RCSA, testified that RCSA had the authority not to renew the distributorship by notice sent in October 2011, since NPP had not performed as expected. There were complaints from customers of stocks not being delivered and NP had failed to meet sales targets. DW4 strongly denied there was any oral partnership agreed, and doubted the suggestion that Philippe Estiot or Luc Cuinet agreed to it since these persons were, at the material times, mere local representatives of the company who had no authority to decide for the company. The conduct of NPP as evidenced by contemporaneous documentary evidence also showed that NPP accepted the relationship as one of distributorship. In his testimony, DW4, when questioned on the alleged oral agreement entered into in 2008, said:</p>
    <p>"Q: The plaintiff is now alleging that Luc Cuinet had previously verbally assured Mr Shanmuganathan of the plaintiff that it would not be necessary to have a formal renewal of the distributorship agreement. What do you have to say about this?</p>
    <p>A: That is not true at all. Luc Cuinet had never reported to or informed me that he had given such verbal assurance to the plaintiff. Had he done so, he surely would have informed me. He is also not authorised to give such representations on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>Q: The plaintiff is now alleging that in a meeting held sometime in January 2008 attended by Philippe Estiot as the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's local representative, it was orally agreed that from 1 January 2008, the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would carry on business by entering into a partnership. Do you agree with this?</p>
    <p>A: Absolutely not. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had never entered into any partnership with the plaintiff. Philippe Estiot had never reported to or informed me of such partnership. In fact, I have had several discussions with the plaintiff 's representative, Mr Shanmuganathan since 2009 and never once has the plaintiff 's representative raised this issue of an alleged partnership with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant with me before."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> As for the contemporaneous documents, RCSA referred to letters from NPP and NPP's solicitors dated 4 January 2012 and 8 February 2012 respectively, and the minutes of four meetings held between the parties in 2011 in which there was no mention whatsoever about any oral partnership.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The 4 January 2012 letter from NPP stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> NPP's solicitor's letter of 8 February 2012 likewise referred to a "distributorship", stating:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> As pleaded, it was purportedly agreed that the parties would continue to carry on business "where the plaintiff will be the sole and exclusive distributor of the Products in Malaysia and Brunei for so long as the plaintiff is able and willing to, for the common benefit of the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and with a view to profit" (para [19], statement of claim). On this basis, RCSA submitted that the alleged oral partnership, if it existed, would be uncertain and void for uncertainty under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;30.;;">s 30 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>: "Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable of being made certain, are void". Despite contending that it was an oral partnership without any documentary proof, in its pleadings NPP was able to aver 15 express terms and conditions of the alleged partnership!</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In terms of NPP's conduct which showed the allegation of the oral partnership being "a pure concoction and an afterthought", RCSA's written submission reads thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> RCSA further argued that even if the oral contract was deemed to exist and was not void for uncertainty, since no fixed period was agreed it was still terminable by a reasonable period of notice. The following cases were cited to show that a nine months' notice period was reasonable in the circumstances: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1989_2_824;"><i>Sykt Jaya v.

      <b>[23]</b> As for the point on the shifting of the evidential burden and the drawing of adverse inference against NPP under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> for failing to call Philippe Estiot and Luc Cuinet, RCSA argued the High Court was correct in its conclusion since both persons had left the employment of RCSA at the material time, ie when the trial commenced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On the tort of conspiracy and interference with contract, the viability of this argument was submitted as being contingent on whether NPP was successful in proving the existence of the alleged oral partnership. We quote the relevant passage in the written submission of RCSA for emphasis:</p>

      <b>G. Evaluation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In evaluating the merits of this appeal, we found that this appeal essentially concerned a simple issue of whether there was an oral partnership agreement on the facts, seen against the requirements of a partnership under our partnership law. This was the linchpin of NPP's argument as the appellant in this appeal. If it did not succeed in proving this oral partnership, the main appeal must fall. As for the evidence advanced by NPP, it centred on the oral testimony of two principal witnesses - Shanmuganathan (PW1) and Vanitha (PW2). PW2's evidence was equivocal. In the final analysis, the High Court had to assess the credibility of PW1's evidence. The High Court found his testimony to be contradictory and unsupported by the contemporaneous documentary evidence. It is a proposition too commonplace to set out in great detail that an appellate court should be slow to interfere with findings of facts by a trial court unless the trial court was clearly wrong. The High Court had observed in this case how PW1's evidence was unreliable. We quote the relevant passage in the judgment of the High Court below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is also an accepted proposition in law that in assessing whether a partnership exists, the court has to consider the intention of the parties, and in the absence of a written agreement, reliance has to be placed on the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_135;;">Partnership Act 1961</LINK>: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_6_118;"><i>Martin Mairin Idang v. Rakanan Jaya Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2011] 6 MLRH 118</LINK>; <i>Chua Ka Seng v. Boonchai Sompolpong</i> [1993] 1 SLR 482 (a Singapore decision, referred to in <i>Martin Mairin Idang</i>, supra). The sharing of profits, in the context of a partnership, is a very relevant indicia, and this is recognised in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_135;4.;;">s 4 of the Partnership Act 1961</LINK>. The decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_15_315;"><i>SBS Exporters Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Tampin Rubber Furniture Industry Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 15 MLRH 315</LINK>, that recognised the importance of this indicia, was cited before us to buttress this point. The observations by this court in <i>SBS Exporters Sdn Bhd</i>, supra, remain very relevant on the facts of this instant appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Further, we recognised the relevance of art XV of the Distributorship Contract which provided:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It was evident that the attempt to prop up an oral partnership agreement flew in the face of this clear provision which constituted an "entire agreement" clause (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_1_745;"><i>Macronet Sdn Bhd v. RHB Bank Berhad</i> [2002] 1 MLRH 745</LINK>; [2002] 3 MLJ 11; [2002] 4 CLJ 729).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> As for the argument on conspiracy and interference with contract, we had no issues on the correctness of the law as advanced by counsel for NPP who cited <i>Kuwait Oil Tanker Co SAK v. Al Bader</i> [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271, <i>Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v. Ching Kai Huat and Others</i> [2008] 1 SLR 80, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2006_1_197;"><i>Quill Construction Sdn Bhd v. Tan Hor Teng &amp; Anor</i> [2006] 1 MLRH 197</LINK>; [2006] 2 CLJ 358; [2006] 4 AMR 451, and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_504;"><i>Renault SA v. Inokom Corporation Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor And Other Applications</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 504</LINK>; [2010] 5 MLJ 394; [2010] 5 CLJ 32, and the dual classification of conspiracy into (a) conspiracy to do an unlawful act and (b) conspiracy to do a lawful act by unlawful means. The facts of this appeal would fall within the second category where it is important to prove that the "predominant purpose" was to injure NPP and injury was thereby caused. On the facts, it could not be said there was such a "predominant purpose". The non-renewal of the distributorship was within the discretion of RCSA and reasonable notice was given. On the question of what would be a reasonable notice period, much depends on the precise facts of the particular case. NPP was given a period of nine months. In our view, this would be reasonable in the circumstances, since the concern of NPP appeared in part to be the expenditure incurred in renting the warehouse in Puchong, but as the evidence indicated, this lease had expired on 30 September 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In any event, once NPP failed to substantiate the existence of the alleged oral agreement of partnership, the claims for conspiracy and unlawful interference with contract consequentially could not stand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On the question of shifting of the evidential burden and the drawing of an adverse inference against NPP as concluded by the High Court, however, we could not agree with the trial judge, but nevertheless, this was not such a fundamental error that must be held to have wholly vitiated the High Court's judgment, since the penultimate burden of proof on the standard of balance of probabilities lay with NPP to prove the existence of the alleged oral partnership agreement. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> relates to a mere presumption of fact "that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it". There must be evidence of a conscious "withholding" of that evidence, and so on the factual matrix of this appeal this condition cannot be said to have been satisfied since Philippe Estiot and Luc Cuinet were at the material times employees of RCSA. By the same token, when the case came to be heard, they had ceased being employees of RCSA and there was evidence that RCSA tried to call Philippe Estiot as a witness, and asked for time to do so, which the court refused. On this basis, an adverse inference could not also be drawn against RCSA. Ultimately, a resolution of the issue had to lie with the question on whom the penultimate burden lay under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">s 101 of the Evidence Act</LINK>. NPP had failed simply to discharge this burden.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Finally, we were not convinced that the essential ingredients of the tort of passing off had been established by RCSA and RCM as pleaded in the counterclaim. This was an alleged passing off of the "Royal Canin" mark in a Facebook page established by NPP. The evidence did not support any inference that the mark was being used to represent the mark as that of NPP to create confusion in the market, and RCSA had failed to adduce any evidence on the probability of damage to their goodwill and reputation. The identification of the mark was throughout with RCSA. RCSA even knew of the Facebook page and took some time to protest. This, we felt, was sufficient evidence of an acquiescence on RCSA's part. Indeed, by the time the High Court delivered its decision, the Facebook had been deactivated. In these circumstances, we were of the unanimous opinion that this part of the appeal should be allowed. The relevant paragraphs in the judgment of the High Court pertaining to the counterclaim are (b), (c) and (d).</p>
    <p>
      <b>H. Conclusion And Orders</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In conclusion therefore, we allowed the appeal in part by affirming para [9](a) of the judgment of the High Court dated 3 June 2013, but set aside paras (b), (c) and (d).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Costs of RM40,000.00 here and below were ordered to be paid by NPP as appellant to RCSA and RCM as respondents. We ordered the deposit to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
