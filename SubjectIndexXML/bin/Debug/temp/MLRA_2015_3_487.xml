    <p>This was the prosecution's appeal against the decision of the High Court in dismissing its application, vide a notice of motion, for the removal of Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee as counsel for the respondent. The main concern of the prosecution was "the issue of perception of society in the said appointment of Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee, as the said counsel". In the instant appeal, therespondent raised a preliminary object ion on the competency of the appeal, contending that the decision of the trial judge in disallowing the prosecution's application was not appealable as the decision of the trial judge made in the course of the trial was not a decision within the meaning stipulated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;3.;;">s 3</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;50.;;">s 50(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. On the other hand, the prosecution submitted that the decision of the trial judge was in respect of the notice of motion and, therefore, that decision was final.</p>

      <b>Held</b> (striking out the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the decision of the High Court judge in dismissing the prosecution's application to remove Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee was a decision made in the course of the trial which did not finally dispose of the rights of the parties. The rights of the parties related to the charges preferred against the respondent, ie whether the respondent would be found guilty or innocent of the charges against him. The rights did not relate to the notice of motion filed by the prosecution. Hence, the appeal filed by the prosecution was an incompetent appeal which was precluded by law.

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Datuk Haji Wasli Mohd Said (the respondent) faced two charges under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_57;3.;;">s 3(b)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961</LINK>. In the midst of the trial in the High Court at Kuala Lumpur, after seven prosecution witnesses testified, the respondent retained Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee bin Abdullah as his lead counsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> After almost three years of Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee representing the respondent, including making appearances in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court in respect of the application to strike out the charges against the respondent, the prosecution took out an application vide a notice of motion, for the removal of Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee as counsel for the respondent. The application was premised on the alleged infringement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_PUAS_1978_369;3.;;">rr 3</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_PUAS_1978_369;4.;;">4</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_PUAS_1978_369;5.;;">5 of the Legal Profession (Practice and Etiquette) Rules 1978</LINK>, and the court's inherent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The main concern of the prosecution, as submitted by learned deputy public prosecutor was "the issue of perception of society in the said appointment of Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee, as the said counsel had appeared as counsel for Tan Sri Kasitah Gaddam in an interrelated criminal case, wherein, Datuk Haji Wasli Mohd Said, was a witness for the prosecution, and was cross-examination <i>(sic)</i> at length, by Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee. In the present criminal action against Datuk Haji Wasli Mohd Said, 46-4-2006, Tan Sri Kasitah Gaddam would be a witness for the prosecution and would invariably be subjected to cross-examination by counsel, Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The prosecution's application to remove Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee was dismissed by the High Court. Aggrieved with the decision, the prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeal. At the outset, learned counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary objection on the competency of the appeal. Having heard the parties, we upheld the preliminary objection and we struck out the appeal. Our reasons now follow.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It was the submission of learned counsel for the respondent that the ruling made by the learned High Court Judge in disallowing the prosecution's application to discharge Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee was not appealable as the decision of the learned judge made in the course of the trial was not a decision within the meaning stipulated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;3.;;">s 3</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;50.;;">s 50(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (the CJA)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In response to the preliminary objection, learned deputy submitted that the decision of the learned High Court Judge was in respect of the notice of motion and that the decision in respect of the notice of motion was final.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It is trite that an appeal is a creature of statute and the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear and determine criminal appeal is provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;50.;;">s 50 of the CJA</LINK> which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Section 3 defines decision as "decision" means any judgment, sentence or order, but does not include any ruling made in the course of a trial or hearing of any cause or matter which does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties;"</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We agreed with learned counsel that the decision of the learned High Court Judge in dismissing the prosecution's application to remove Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee was a decision made in the course of the trial which did not finally dispose of the rights of the parties. The rights of the parties relate to the charges preferred against the respondent, ie whether the respondent will be found guilty or innocent of the charges. The rights do not relate to the notice of motion filed by the prosecution.</p>

      <b>[9]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_4_511;"><i>Karpal Singh Ram Singh v. PP</i> [2012] 4 MLRA 511</LINK>; [2012] 5 CLJ 537 where at p 516, Suriyadi Halim Omar FCJ speaking for the Federal Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> And at p 518, Suriyadi Halim Omar FCJ further stated that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Given all the above, we unanimously found that the appeal filed by the prosecution was an incompetent appeal which was precluded by law. The appeal was accordingly struck out.</p>
