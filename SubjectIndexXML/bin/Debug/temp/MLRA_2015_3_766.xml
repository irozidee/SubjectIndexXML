    <p>The appellants were appealing against their convictions and sentences for culpable homicide not amounting to murder of the deceased under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>. They submitted, <i>inter alia</i>, that the death of the deceased was "self-inflicted"; that the appellants were exercising their right of private defence over their own bodies and property; and that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the appellants' defence. On the other hand, the Public Prosecutor appealed against the sentence of nine years' imprisonment imposed on the 1st appellant and the sentence of seven years' imprisonment imposed on the 2nd appellant, on the ground that those sentences were manifestly inadequate considering the maximum sentence provided by law was 30 years. Further, the Public Prosecutor also submitted that the sentences against both the appellants ought to be the same. Hence, the issues to be decided were, amongst others, whether the trial judge had assessed the appellants' defence correctly; whether the appellants had proven their defence of self-defence; and whether the sentences imposed on the appellants were adequate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing both appeals):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The finding of the trial judge was made based on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Further, the evidence of the pathologist fully supported the finding that the injuries suffered by the deceased could not be "self-inflicted". Thus, there was no palpable and overriding error on the part of the trial judge in his assessment of the facts before him. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge's finding was made upon a consideration of the whole of the evidence at the end of the defence case. Further, in rejecting the appellants' defence of self-defence, the trial judge had decided that from the overall facts and circumstances of the case, there was no apprehension on the part of the appellants that the deceased might have caused death or grievous hurt to both of them. (paras 42-43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Whether the apprehension of death or grievous hurt was reasonable or not was a question of fact depending on the circumstances of the case. The weapon used, the manner of using it, the nature of the assault and other surrounding circumstances were all matters that needed to be considered by the trial judge. In this instance, there was no substantial and compelling reason to disagree with the trial judge's findings. (para 48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The imposition of sentence was very much an exercise of discretion by the trial judge. The concept of judicial discretion involved a right to choose between more than one possible course of action upon which there was room for reasonable people to hold differing views as to which was to be preferred. Different judges may have different views and may sometimes reach different conclusions on the same set of facts. In the instant appeal, it had not been demonstrated that the trial judge had breached any of the guiding principles of sentencing and neither had it been shown that the sentences imposed were wrong in law. Furthermore, the sentences were also neither manifestly inadequate nor were they manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case. (paras 55-56)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> There was no merit in the submission by the Public Prosecutor that the sentences for the two appellants ought to have been the same. The trial judge was entitled to impose different sentences having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the mitigating factors that had been put forward before him. Therefore, there was no reason to interfere with the sentences imposed on the appellants. (paras 57 &amp; 59)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Balia Yusof Wahi JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> These two appeals were heard together. In Appeal No: Q-05-248-10-2012, the two appellants Yong Teng Fun (1st appellant) and Jong Soon Kwong (2nd appellant) are appealing against their conviction and sentence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In Appeal No: Q-05(S)-266-10-2012 the Public Prosecutor is appealing against the sentence of nine years' imprisonment on the 1st appellant and seven years' imprisonment on the 2nd appellant on the ground that the sentence imposed by the High Court is manifestly inadequate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In respect of Appeal No: Q-05-248-10-2012, the appellants' conviction had been attacked on the following two grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Without going into the details of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, suffice it to state that there was a quarrel between the deceased and the 2nd appellant (who was the 2nd accused in the court below). The deceased was alleged to have used a broomstick to hit the 2nd appellant, causing the 2nd appellant to fall and injured his forehead. The 1st appellant (the 1st accused in the court below) hit the deceased with a plastic chair as testified by PW7 and PW1. The 1st appellant then proceeded to his vehicle (a Toyota land cruiser) intending to bring the 2nd appellant to the hospital for treatment of the 2nd appellant's forehead injury. While both the appellants were seated in the vehicle together with the 1st appellant's son, PW7 came and tried to explain to the 1st appellant that what had happened between the deceased and the 2nd appellant was just a misunderstanding and that the deceased had accidently hit the 2nd appellant. The 1st appellant refused to believe PW7's explanation. At this juncture, the deceased rushed towards the land cruiser and smashed its windscreen with a broomstick. The 1st appellant reacted by taking a rattan (exh P4) from underneath the seat of the land cruiser and hit the deceased twice on his left forehead.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> According to PW10, the 2nd appellant also came out of the land cruiser and "the three of them had a fight". PW1 and PW7 also stated that the 1st appellant's son also joined the fight. The fighting according PW1 only stopped after she hugged her husband (the deceased). The 1st and the 2nd appellants together with the 1st appellant's son left the scene in the land cruiser.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Having rested for a while, the deceased went to the kitchen of PW8's house to clean the wounds on his left ear and applied some medication on the injuries. He also had a cigarette thereafter. Suddenly, according to PW8, the deceased was seen rushing towards the gate and knocked his head against the drain and he fell unconscious. Upon being questioned by the court, PW8 explained that the deceased dived into the drain and knocked against the edge of the drain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The deceased was then taken to the Bintulu Hospital and upon admission at the Emergency Unit, he was pronounced dead. PW14 testified that the deceased could have died even before arrival at the hospital.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The two appellants were charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> and were ordered to enter their defence on the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> After hearing the defence case, with the two appellants giving evidence on oath and calling three other defence witnesses, the learned High Court Judge found the two appellants guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>. The 1st appellant was sentenced to nine years imprisonment with effect from the date of arrest while the 2nd appellant was sentenced to seven years with effect from the date of his arrest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the death of the deceased was not caused by the appellants. It was "self inflicted", to borrow the words of the learned counsel. The deceased dived into the drain and injured himself. The evidence of PW8 supports this contention. The hairline fracture on the deceased's skull could have been caused by the fall as agreed to by PW12, the pathologist upon being cross-examined by the appellants' counsel. The deceased only became unconscious after the fall into the drain. In the light of the two possibilities, it was submitted that an inference more favourable to the appellants ought to have been drawn in that the injury was not caused by the appellants' act of hitting the deceased with a rattan and a plastic chair.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was never disputed by the appellants that they were involved in the fight with the deceased and that he was hit with the rattan. The 1st appellant said he merely used the plastic chair to protect and defend himself from the attacks by the deceased. The 2nd appellant admitted that he too, came out of the land cruiser with a rattan but denied hitting the deceased with the same. This happened when the deceased had smashed the windscreen of the land cruiser.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The medical evidence proffered by PW12, the pathologist and exh P40, the autopsy report revealed the following injuries sustained by the deceased:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The cause of death was stated to be intracranial bleeding with fracture of skull due to blunt head injuries. The chance of survival of a person who sustained the aforesaid injuries according to PW12, is slim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In response to cross-examination by the appellants' counsel, PW12 testified that the aforesaid head injuries were more likely due to the hit with the rattan rather than a fall from a standing position. Still in cross-examination, PW12 had explained, "In my opinion it is more likely due to the rattan due to the strong force because this deceased has fracture of skull - hairline - and subdural haemorrhage rather than limited to the haematoma below the skin at the left temporal area and anterior parietal area".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned trial judge had made a finding that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We see no wrong with the finding made by the learned trial judge. It involved a finding of fact which this appellate tribunal will loathe to interfere. A finding of fact will not be subject to any interference by an appellate tribunal unless there are substantial and compelling reasons for disagreeing with the finding. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1969_1_382;"><i>Herchun Singh &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [1969] 1 MLRA 382</LINK>; [1969] 1 MLJ 209 and <i>Sheo Swarup v. King Emperor</i> [1934] AIR PC 227).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The finding of the learned High Court Judge was made based on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses primarily PW1, PW7, PW8 and PW10 on the altercation between the deceased and the two appellants. Further, the evidence of PW12 fully supports the finding that the injuries suffered by the deceased could not be "self inflicted" as suggested by the appellants. The finding was made after the judge having the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. Such finding is entitled to great respect. As an appellate court, we should not reverse that finding of the trial judge in the absence of palpable and overriding error which affected His Lordship's assessment of the facts. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_784;"><i>Lee Ah Seng &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 784</LINK>; [2007] 6 MLJ 1; [2007] 5 CLJ 1). We find no such palpable and overriding error on the part of the learned trial judge in his assessment of the facts before him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We found no merit in the appeal on this ground.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Moving on to the second ground of appeal, it was submitted on behalf of the appellants that they were exercising their right of private defence over their own bodies and property. The property being the Toyota Land Cruiser belonging to the 1st appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The appellants further contended that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses lent credence to the stand they took in raising the said defence namely, the evidence of PW8, PW10 and PW14.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In his defence, the 1st appellant testified that on 5 June 2009 after having dinner at Lu Fa Café, he, his eldest son Michael Yong Tein Chin and one, Ah Kwai (PW10 - Ting Pik Kai) went to Eagle Karaoke, and had some beer. While at Eagle Karaoke, the 1st appellant received a phone call from Ting Pek Khing (PW8). PW8 told him that there is a quarrel at his house and asked him to come to advise our friend not to quarrel". Together with his son and PW10, the 1st appellant proceeded to PW8's house. On his way there, he received another call from PW8 asking him to come as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Upon arrival, the 2nd appellant who was there, told the 1st appellant "that they were still quarrelling". The 1st appellant further testified that he heard Ah Kai informing the 2nd appellant that the deceased assaulted him. The 1st appellant himself did not see the deceased assaulting Ah Kai.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Thereafter, according to the 1st appellant, the 2nd appellant went over to the deceased and was punched on his left cheek. The deceased got hold of a stick and hit the 2nd appellant's upper right forehead. The 1st appellant then took a plastic chair to defend himself because he was scared that the deceased will assault him too.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Seeing that the 2nd appellant was bleeding, he then took a piece of cloth from the floor and bandaged the 2nd appellant's head and lifted the 2nd appellant and brought him to his vehicle (Toyota Land Cruiser) to bring him to the hospital.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The 1st appellant testified further, that while he was taking the 2nd appellant to the vehicle, the deceased hit him with a stick. As he was about to start the vehicle, the deceased came over to the front of the vehicle and asked him to come down and smashed the windscreen of the vehicle with a stick. The deceased then dragged him out and hit him on his forearm with a stick. In retaliation, the 1st appellant said he went back to the vehicle and took out a rattan from below the driver's seat and hit the deceased with it. The deceased, was said to have moved backward and kneeled down, lost his balance and fell to the ground. The 1st and 2nd appellants then left for the hospital. Later, at the hospital the 1st appellant was informed by PW1 that the deceased had jumped into the drain and committed suicide.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The 2nd appellant in his evidence went on to state that on the same day at about 2pm together with PW7 and the deceased they went to PW8's house for a barbeque in conjunction with the Gawai festival. They then started drinking beer. Later on, the three of them went to 'Shanghai Karaoke' where they had more beer and met one, Ah Wong who was alleged to be having an affair with the 2nd appellant's wife. A quarrel then started among the four of them - PW7, the deceased, the 2nd appellant and Ah Wong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> According to the 2nd appellant, during the quarrel, Ah Wong told him that he would bring some gangsters from Sibu to assault them. Thereafter, Ah Wong left and the three of them returned to PW8's house. At PW8's house, the deceased was still very angry, saying he was not scared of the gangsters whom Ah Wong wanted to bring from Sibu.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> After the arrival of the 1st appellant, his son and PW10 at PW8's house, PW10 approached the deceased and advised him to cool down. According to the 2nd appellant the deceased was very angry and wanted to take action against the Sibu gangsters. The 2nd appellant then saw the deceased punching PW10 on the left cheek. The 2nd appellant then stepped in and approached the deceased informing him that PW10 was his good friend.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> He asked the deceased to cool down, but the deceased punched him on his left forehead and the deceased then took a 'wooden stick' and hit him on his right forehead, causing him to fall to the ground. His forehead was bleeding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The 1st appellant came and lifted him from the ground and brought him to the vehicle to go to the hospital. While they were in the vehicle, the deceased came over and smashed the windscreen with a stick. The deceased then opened the door on the driver's side and dragged the 1st appellant out. The deceased was holding a wooden stick, and the 1st appellant had nothing in his hands.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The 2nd appellant further testified that the deceased hit the 1st appellant with a stick and thereafter the 1st appellant went back to his vehicle and took out a rattan. Both of them had a fight and the deceased was seen in a squatting position and then he fell to the ground.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The appellants also called two other witnesses in support of their defence, DW2, Dr Aruchamy Ramalingam and DW4, Dr Maria Shelyn Wong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> DW4 was called by the defence to ascertain the cause of the 2nd appellant's forehead injury. She was cross-examined by the prosecution as to whether the 2nd appellant's forehead injury was consistent with him falling "on a cement floor" or "on the sharp edge of a water tank".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> DW4 opined that such a fall would have to be "from high and would unlikely if merely falling very fast from a standing position". This was in respect of the 2nd appellant having been said to have fallen on a cement floor. Concerning the falling on the sharp edge of a water tank, her answer was a plain "No" and further opined that if the 2nd appellant falls very fast (a heavy fall, so to say) she replied "it may cause the right forehead wound, but it does not explain the pattern of the skull fracture". One would recall that the 2nd appellant suffered a depressed frontal wound fracture of the skull. In essence, DW4's evidence suggests that the injury on the 2nd appellant's forehead could not be a result of him falling on the cement floor or hitting the edge of the water tank, but must have been caused by the deceased's assault.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> DW2, Dr Aruchamy Ramalingam treated the 1st appellant who, according to him sustained a deep cut wound over the left elbow measuring about 8 cm. Resulting from the cut wound, the 1st appellant also suffered an injury to the ulnar nerve, fracture medial condyle and fracture olecranon. As to what caused the injuries, DW4 testified that they were caused by a sharp object.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The defence put forward was primarily that of self defence and alternatively, grave and sudden provocation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In considering the defence put up by the appellants, the learned trial judge had revisited among others, the evidence of PW1 and PW7 in the light of the defence evidence. PW7 was the brother of the deceased while PW1 was the deceased's wife.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Having done so, the learned trial judge came to a finding that "in all probability it was actually the deceased who caused the 2nd appellant's serious forehead injury, and that he inflicted such injury presumably due to the 2nd appellant's attempt to calm him down after he (the deceased) had earlier on punched PW10 on his face; presumably angered by the deceased's action, the 1st appellant then tried to hit the deceased with a plastic chair but the deceased managed to avoid it". (See p 30 of 40 Supplementary Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Proceeding further, the learned trial judge also considered the alternative submission of counsel that "... the facts of the case show that there was no premeditation on the part of both the accused. The provocation came in the form of the deceased assaulting and causing serious injury to the 2nd appellant and then subsequently causing damage to the property of the 1st appellant being the Toyota Land Cruiser".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Having considered the totality of the evidence led by the prosecution and re-evaluating the same against the defence evidence, His Lordship concluded:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The learned trial judge had found the evidence of the two appellants in their defence had cast serious doubt on the accuracy and credibility on material aspects, in the evidence of PW1 and PW7 as to the forehead injury on the 2nd appellant being accidentally caused by the deceased. It was the deceased who had been behaving aggressively starting from the quarrel and punching PW10 on his face and the 2nd appellant intervening to calm him down.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> This conclusion arrived at by the learned trial judge is clearly supported by the evidence adduced and this court will loath to interfere. It was a finding made upon a consideration of the whole evidence at the end of the defence case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In rejecting self defence, the learned trial judge had agreed with the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor that from the overall facts and circumstances, there was no apprehension on the part of the appellants that the deceased may cause death or grievous hurt to both of them after the deceased had smashed the windscreen of the vehicle they were in.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> While we may agree that the learned trial judge merely dealt with this issue very briefly in his grounds of judgement, suffice it to say that His Lordship was right is agreeing with the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor on the applicability of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;100.;;">s 100 of the Penal Code</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Ratanlal on <i>Law of Crimes</i>, states that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;100.;;">s 100 of the Penal Code</LINK> must be subject to the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;99.;;">s 99</LINK> of the same and four cardinal conditions must have existed before the taking of the life of a person is justified on the plea of self defence. The four conditions are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;99.;;">Section 99 of the Penal Code</LINK> provides a limitation to the right of private defence. If an accused person has time to have recourse to seek the protection of a public authority or inflicts more harm than necessary for the purpose of defending his person, he cannot avail himself of the protection provided by the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Based on the "overall facts and circumstances" as the learned trial judge had put it, we are not in a position to disagree with the finding made. We asked the question and looked at the photograph of the vehicle to see whether it was smashed. The photograph is not clear but certainly the front windscreen was not broken or smashed as the witnesses say. Perhaps, it was the front window screen that was smashed. The deceased was said to be armed with a broomstick or a stick. The 2nd appellant mentioned that the deceased used a broomstick to hit him on his forehead and when the 1st appellant was hit, the deceased was also said to be using a 'wooden stick'. At that point of time, both of the appellants were in the vehicle and there was no reason they could have not just left the place and head for the hospital. Further, as the story unfold, after being dragged out of the vehicle, the 1st appellant came back and got hold of a rattan from under the seat of the vehicle and went for the deceased with the 2nd appellant following suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Whether the apprehension of death or grievous hurt was reasonable or not is a question of fact and depend on the circumstances of the case. The weapon used, the manner of using it, the nature of the assault and other surrounding circumstances are all matters that need to be considered by the trial judge. Based on this factual matrix, can the assault by the deceased may reasonably cause the apprehension of death or that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault? Due respect must be given to the learned trial judge as a trier of facts and we will be slow to interfere with His Lordship's findings. In the absence of any palpable and overriding error which affected His Lordship's assessment of the facts this court will always be reluctant to interfere. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_784;"><i>Lee Ah Seng &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 784</LINK>; [2007] 6 MLJ 1; [2007] 5 CLJ 1, <i>Bear Island Foundation v. Attorney General of Ontario</i> [1991] 83 DLR (4TH) 381). Similarly, unless there are substantial and compelling reasons for disagreeing with the finding, this court will be slow to interfere. We find no such palpable and overriding error on the part of learned trial judge in his assessment of the facts before him and no substantial and compelling reason to disagree.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> For the aforesaid reasons, we found no merit in the appellants' appeal and the appeal is hereby dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecutor's Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In appealing against the sentence passed by the learned High Court Judge, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor was of the view that the sentence is manifestly low considering that the maximum sentence provided by law is 30 years. Further, it was submitted that the sentence against both the appellants ought to be the same. The learned trial judge had imposed a sentence of nine years' imprisonment against the 1st appellant and seven years against the 2nd appellant. It was submitted that both the appellants bear equal liability as they were charged together under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. Both should be equally liable and suffer the same sentence. The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor had suggested that a sentence of imprisonment for a period of between 20 to 24 years would be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Learned counsel for the appellants on the other hand submitted that the sentence imposed is excessive and further submitted that the sentence should be for the period that the appellants had served before bail was allowed by the court. We were told that the appellants had already served a sentence of imprisonment for a period of three years, three months and seven days by then.
</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> At the outset, it must be noted that the court will not alter a sentence merely because it might have passed a different sentence (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1976_1_23;"><i>PP v. Loo Choon Fatt</i> [1976] 1 MLRH 23</LINK>; [1976] 2 MLJ 256, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_561;"><i>Ang Chai Seng v. PP</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 561</LINK>; [2000] 2 MLJ 35; [2000] 1 CLJ 213)</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Jeffrey Tan J (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2006_4_210;"><i>Annantan Subramaniam v. PP</i> [2006] 4 MLRH 210</LINK>; [2007] 8 CLJ 1 referring to an article, <i>Civil and Criminal Appeals in Malaysia</i> by Tan Kee Hong pp 191-192 commenting on appellate interference with the sentence imposed by the trial court, had listed out the following circumstances where interference may be justified:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The imposition of sentence is very much an exercise of discretion by the trial judge. The concept of judicial discretion involves a right to choose between more than one possible course of action upon which there is room for reasonable people to hold differing views as to which is to be preferred. Different judges may have different views and may sometimes reach different conclusion on the same set of facts. That is inevitable. Some may be very conscientious and may have different set of sentence while others equally conscientious may have thought otherwise. Therefore, sentences do vary. This court will not willy-nilly interfere and substitute its own sentence for the one imposed by the trial court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> In our judgment, it has not been demonstrated that the learned trial judge had breached any of the guiding principles of sentencing and neither has it been shown that the sentence imposed is wrong in law. The sentence is also neither manifestly inadequate nor is it manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We further find no merit in the submission that the sentence between the two appellants ought to have been the same. While it may be true that liability under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> is equal, the learned trial judge was perfectly entitled to impose different sentences having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and the mitigating factors that has been put forward before him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> There is no exact mathematical formula for the imposition of sentence and standardisation of sentence is something which should not be adopted as a rule of thumb. As succinctly put by Yong Peng How CJ Singapore in <i>Soong Hee Sin v. Public Prosecutor</i> [2001] 2 SLR 253:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Again we find no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed and for the aforesaid reasons, the prosecutor's appeal against sentence is hereby dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In conclusion, these two appeals are hereby dismissed and the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned trial judge is affirmed.</p>
