    <p>This appeal stemmed from the appellants' claim against the respondents for pure economic loss. The claim was made for late delivery of vacant possession of units of industrial buildings purchased by the appellants from the developer of an industrial building project in which the respondents were the architects of the project concerned. It was the appellants' case that their respective sale and purchase agreements with the developer ('SPAs') provided that vacant possession was to be delivered within 24 months from the date of the approval of the building plan but instead it was delivered eight years later. The appellants alleged that the respondents caused the delay when they made an amendment to the original layout plan of the project. It was also alleged that the respondents delayed in obtaining the certificate of fitness for occupation ('CFO'). On the other hand, the respondents claimed that the amendment to the original layout plan was made due to the refusal of one of the neighbouring landowners to give consent. As for the delay in obtaining the CFO, it was due to the developer not meeting the requirements set by the Department of Environment ('DOE') for the construction of the relevant toxic waste water treatment plant ('CEITS'). The trial judge found that the respondents breached their duty of care to the appellants and apportioned liability at 50% against them. The Court of Appeal reversed the said decision finding that the delay was not attributed to the respondents' negligence but to the developer's. The Court of Appeal centred on the tripartite relationship between the developer, the appellants and the respondents and held that a contractual remedy existed for the claim. Also, the appellants' claim for loss of progress claims and interest and loss of use and costs of alternative buildings, rental profits and incomes, being purely financial in nature, was not recoverable since they were not linked to any personal injury, structural defects or damage to the units concerned. The questions in the present appeal posed for determination were: (1) whether the architects in a construction project owed a duty of care to purchasers apart from their duty in contract or tort to the developer; (2) whether the architects' liability in tort to the purchasers should arise on the basis that they fell within the range of persons who were reasonably foreseeable as likely to be injured by their lack of skill or diligence; (3) whether the purchasers' only remedy in law was to sue the developer; (4) whether the Federal Court as the apex court should not be the final determiner of judicial policy on extensions of liability of the architects to cover pure economic loss; and (5) whether a project architect could avoid liability for negligence by saying that he relied on the designs and plans of another professional or by delegating the task.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the absence of any contract, an architect rendering his professional services in a construction project could be made liable for negligence if the damage and injury suffered by the purchasers were caused by his act or omission within the architect's scope of duty of care. The question was whether the construction of the CEITS including other matters arising thereof and the preparation of the original layout plan and amendments thereto fell within the professional work of the respondents. (paras 30-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The SPAs specifically imposed on the developer a duty to construct the CEITS according to specifications required by the DOE and the relevant statutory provisions. The respondents need not assume responsibility for the delay in question when the CEITS was not functioning in accordance with the requirements set by the DOE. It was not within the scope of the respondents' professional work. The respondents' refusal to submit the application for CFO was merely in the discharge of their duty of care to the appellants in view of the project which was a special industrial project and ensuring that the CEITS functioned in accordance with the standard required by the DOE. On the other hand, the preparation of the original layout plan and its subsequent amendment were made in the course of the respondents' professional work, which had resulted in undue delay in the completion of the industrial buildings. The question was whether the respondents were negligent in carrying out the developer's instructions. That question must be answered within the purview of the scope of duty of care in the law of negligence. (paras 32-33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The common law principles of foreseeability and proximity gave rise to a duty of care. The threshold test in determining the existence of a duty of care was that of foreseeability. The test was whether damage to someone in the plaintiff's position was a reasonable foreseeable consequence of the defendant's negligence. Reasonable forseeability did not itself lead to a duty of care. There must also be a close and direct relationship of proximity between the parties. Liability was judged by the standard of the reasonable man that he ought to have foreseen the consequences of his act. In the present case, the requirement of reasonable foreseeability was not satisfied. As the architect for the project, the layout plan was prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions received by the respondents from the developer. The respondents were mainly responsible for the design and safety of the industrial buildings and compliance of the relevant laws. In the circumstances, it would not be reasonable to impose a duty on the respondents to go into a detailed inquiry of the developer's obligations for they were matters exclusively within the developer's scope of duty. Further, the SPAs provided that the developer or the respondents might make reasonable amendments to the building plan from time to time with the approval of the appropriate authorities. The issue of consent of the neighbouring landowners, which triggered the delay, was well within the scope of the developer's duty. Therefore, applying the standards of the reasonable man, the respondents could not have foreseen any liability for consequential financial loss to the appellants. The appellants' claim did not fall within the respondents' scope of work. The appellants also failed to establish proximity of relationship between the parties to give rise to a duty of care. In view of the terms of the SPAs between the appellants and the developer and the specific remedy provided therein, the appellants' claim must fail. (paras 34-41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The requirements of foreseeability, proximity and policy considerations must exist in any claim for negligence. The most difficult ingredient to prove in establishing a duty of care was the requirement of sufficient proximity between the claimant and the defendant. The court would have to look at the closeness of the relationship between the parties and other factors to determine sufficient proximity based on the facts and circumstances of each case. Those factors were likely to vary in different categories of cases. The fact that damages sought by the claimant was pure economic loss not flowing from personal injury or damage to the property was also a factor to be considered. A more restricted approach was preferable for cases of pure economic loss. As such, the concepts of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance were important factors to be established for purposes of fulfilling the proximity requirement. The reason for a more stringent approach taken in the claims involving pure economic loss was because such loss might lead to an indeterminate liability being imposed on a particular class of defendants, thus leading to policy issues. (paras 43-44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The legal position in respect of claims for pure economic loss in the law of negligence was a little unclear in Malaysia. At the apex court, the claims for pure economic loss were largely decided on considerations of public policy. In <i>Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa Cheng Loon &amp; Ors (the Highland Towers'</i> case), the Federal Court held that there could be no recovery for pure economic loss against a local authority on grounds of public policy. That law was re-stated by the Federal Court in <i>UDA Holdings Bhd v. Koperasi Pasaraya Malaysia Bhd &amp; Other Appeals</i>. The question was whether the law extended to private bodies or professionals rendering services for commercial consideration. (paras 48-50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The majority decision by the Federal Court in the <i>Highland Towers'</i> case reserved their view as to the approach to be adopted by the courts in Malaysia in dealing with claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases. The judgment was confined to issues of public policy on the liability of a local authority in an action for negligence for pure economic loss. The policy approach could be explained by the common stand of the parties, in that action, on recovery of pure economic loss which was permissible in the law of negligence and that the actual dispute was merely on the application of the law to the facts of the case. As regards the proper approach that should be used in imposing a duty of care, legal thinking was divided between the use of general principles as a test for duty, and the incremental approach, which called for the development of the law in incremental stages by using precedents as the yardstick against which all claims in negligence should be measured. (paras 78, 79 &amp; 82)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The court must give consideration to the presence of a contractual matrix between the developer and the purchasers, which clearly defined the rights and liabilities of parties and their relative bargaining positions. There could be no action against the architects if the remedy asked for was specifically provided for in the contract. Otherwise, it had the effect of rewriting the contractual terms. Such claims must be dismissed on grounds of policy. Nevertheless, a claim for negligence must be brought within the scope of duty of care. The recoverability of claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases was dependent on the facts of individual cases. Some measure of public policy must be considered though it should not be the sole determinant of liability. (para 84)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> It would be against public policy to impose on architects a duty to deliver vacant possession of the buildings within the developer's contractual period. That would only serve to compromise or impede their professional duty in ensuring that the building laws were observed and that the structure of the buildings was safe. (para 85)</p>

      <b>Zainun Ali FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is a unanimous decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Issues</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appeal before us stemmed from a dispute relating to an industrial building project known as "Projek Skim Bangunan Industri Ringan Bersepadu Pencemaran Bebas" in Seberang Perai Tengah, Pulau Pinang. As its name suggests the project was a special industrial project intended to cater for industries that were likely to produce and discharge environmentally hazardous substances and which may pose environmental risks to living organisms as defined in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_127;;">Environmental Quality Act 1974 (EQA)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> This appeal focuses on the practical problems in the law of negligence with regard to the general and consequential issues relating to the duty of care owed by the respondents to the appellants against damages being pure economic loss, not linked to any personal injury or structural defects or damage to the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> There were 50 appellants in this appeal. They were the purchasers of units of industrial building in the above named project. The developer of the project was Merger Acceptance Sdn Bhd. In 1995, the appellants signed their respective sale and purchase agreements (the SPAs) with the developer. The respondents were the Project Architects appointed by the developer. Rakyat Corporation Sdn Bhd (the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant at the High Court) was the Project Manager.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Since the project was a special industrial project as stated above compliance with the mandatory requirements of the relevant statutory provisions was crucial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The salient terms of the SPAs are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 20 December 1994, the original layout plan was approved by the Local Authority, Majlis Perbandaran Seberang Prai (MPSP). In granting approval for the project, MPSP imposed a condition that the requirements of the DOE in particular the provisions of the Environmental Quality (Industrial Effluent and Discharge) Regulations 1979 must be complied with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Following an application by the developer, the DOE vide its approval letter dated 12 August 1997 made it mandatory that a CEITS be designed by a specialist licensed by the DOE and built according to certain specifications. In addition, the CEITS must first be functioning and operational to the satisfaction of the DOE before the CFO for the project can be issued. Accordingly, the developer engaged a specialist consultant as specified and built a CEITS for the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It is the appellants' case that vacant possession of the industrial building was to be delivered within 24 months from the date of the approval of the building plan. But there was a delay of eight years in the completion of the industrial building due to the following:</p>
    <p>i. Amendment of the original layout plan. The original layout plan was approved by MPSP on 20 December 1994. The original layout plan was submitted to MPSP on the assumption that all the neighbouring landowners had consented to some slope cutting on their respective property. However, due to the refusal of one of the neighbouring landowners to give his consent, the respondents were then required to amend the original layout plan to reflect the true road and drainage works that had been carried out. The amended layout plan was then approved by MPSP on 5 August 1999. ii. Delay in obtaining the certificates of fitness for occupation (CFO) The DOE refused to grant certification of approval for the CEITS since it did not function according to the requirement of the DOE. In the absence of this certification of approval, the respondents thus refused to comply with the developer's instruction to apply for the CFO. The respondents had taken the stand that the approval for the project from MPSP was conditional upon compliance with the requirements imposed by the DOE and the statutory provisions of the Environment Quality (Industrial Effluent and Discharge) Regulations 1979.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Consequently on 13 June 2005, the respondents resigned as the architects of the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The CFO for the industrial building was subsequently issued on 4 July 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 27 February 2003, the appellants filed an action for negligence against the Project Manager (1<sup>st</sup> defendant at the High Court) and the respondents for financial loss suffered, due to late delivery of vacant possession of their industrial units. It is the appellants' case against the respondents that as the project architects, the latter had acted negligently in the preparation of the original layout plan resulting in its amendment, in the supervision of the works and in the certification of completed works, thereby causing a delay of eight years for the completion of the industrial building.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellants' Claims</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellants' claims are pecuniary in nature and fall under the heading of pure economic loss. They could be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The developer was wound up in 2002. This was followed by winding up of Rakyat Corporation Sdn Bhd (as Project Manager) in November 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> After a trial of the action, the High Court Judge found the respondents liable for the delay in the completion of the project and apportioned liability at 50% against them. The court found that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The trial judge then concluded that the respondents owed a duty of care to the appellants for proper inspection and/or supervision or omission of the work at the site and that there was breach of such duty which contributed to the delay in the issuance of the CFO. The trial judge held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> On appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the trial judge. It must be noted that the appellants' claim was dismissed largely on grounds of policy. The judgment of the court was centred on the tripartite relationship between the developer, the appellants and the respondents and the existence of contractual remedy in that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was also highlighted that in the present case, the appellants' claims for damages were purely financial in nature. Such damages were not recoverable since they were not linked to any personal injury or structural defects or damage to the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On the findings of facts, the court found that the trial judge erred in his finding when he concluded that the respondents were negligent in exercising their supervisory duties. The Court of Appeal viewed that the evidence before the court showed that the delay in obtaining the CFO was not attributed to the respondents' negligence. It held that:</p>

      <b>[20]</b> The appellants were granted leave to appeal to the Federal Court on the following questions of law:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Appellants' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The appellants' main thrust was that the respondents were negligent in preparing the original layout plan. The respondents response was that the said layout plan had to be amended due to the non-consent of one of the neighbouring landowners. Thus rectification works had to be done. The certification of the completed works was affected, which caused and contributed to the eight-year delay in the completion of the project;</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The appellants went on to submit that a contractual relationship does not preclude a liability in tort. An architect owes a contractual duty and a parallel duty in tort. (<i>Belfield Computer Services v. E Turner &amp; Sons Limited</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 1823 and <i>Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd, Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd, Hughes v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd, Arbuthnott v. Feltrim Underwriting Agencies Ltd, Deeny v. Gooda Walker Ltd (in liq)</i> [1995] 2 AC 145);</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> That there was a breach of duty of care on the part of the respondents. The appellants indicated that they have satisfied the tests of foreseeability and proximity in that the respondents were in a position to foresee that their acts and omissions complained of would result in a delay in obtaining the CFO and consequential financial loss to the appellants who were the "known recipients";</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In Malaysia, although a claim for pure economic loss is not recoverable against a local authority on grounds of public policy (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_166;"><i>Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa Cheng Loon &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 166</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 389; [2006] 2 CLJ 1; [2006] 2 AMR 563), the law does not extend to private bodies or professionals rendering services for commercial consideration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Respondents' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The respondents averred that the CEITS for the project was designed by a specialist licensed by the DOE and was constructed by the developer. It was not within the scope of the respondents as the architect for the project to determine the site location, design and specifications of the CEITS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The refusal of the respondents to apply for CFO was due to the noncompliance of the mandatory DOE requirement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The appellants' claims are for pure economic loss suffered due to the delay and/or non-application of CFO of the industrial building. The existence of a duty of care must depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The court must also exercise caution in extending a duty of care to new circumstances (case referred: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_166;"><i>Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa Cheng Loon &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 166</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 389; [2006] 2 CLJ 1; [2006] 2 AMR 563). It would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose on the respondents (as Project Architects) a duty of care for a responsibility which they had not assumed or one which is not within their professional scope of duty. It would also be against public policy to impose on all architects the duty to deliver vacant possession of buildings within the developer's contractual period. The above contention is strengthened by the fact that the remedy afforded to the appellants for late delivery claims are contractually provided for under s 7.01(b) of the SPAs.</p>

      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Architect May Be Liable For Negligence Against A Third Party</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The present case is a building construction dispute where the rights of the appellants were largely governed by the contracts entered into with the developer. The party being sued were the respondents. In the absence of any contract between the appellants and the respondents, the appellants brought their action in tort relying on breach of duty of care.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Tortious liability arises from a wrongful act where the common law imposes a duty to take reasonable care. It is settled law that despite the existence of a contractual relationship between parties in an action, liability in negligence extends beyond the contractual obligations (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_116;"><i>Lembaga Kemajuan Tanah Persekutuan v. Mariam Mangu &amp; Ors</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 116</LINK>; [1984] 1 MLJ 283; [1984] 1 CLJ 197).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In the absence of any contract, an architect rendering his professional service in a construction project can be made liable for negligence if the damage and injury suffered by the purchasers were caused by his act or omission within the scope of duty of care of the architect. In <i>Voli v. Inglewood Shire Council</i> [1963] ALR 657, an architect was made liable for injury caused to the plaintiff as a result of the collapse of the stage designed by the architect. It was held by the High Court of Australia that an architect may, in appropriate circumstances owe a duty of care in tort as regards the sufficiency of his design and supervisory work. Such a duty can be owed to third parties with whom he has no contract. At p 661, Windeyer J held that:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Applying the above principles, in the present case, a preliminary question that needs to be answered is whether the construction of the CEITS including other matters arising thereof and the preparation of the original layout plan including the amendments made to the original layout plan fall within the professional work of the respondents?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It cannot be disputed that the construction of the CEITS was not the responsibility of the respondents. Clause 14.02 and the Sixth Schedule of the SPAs specifically imposed on the developer a duty to build the CEITS for treatment of hazardous and toxic waste according to specifications required by the DOE and the statutory provisions of the Environment Quality Act (Industrial Effluent and Discharge) Regulations 1978. That being the case, the CEITS was designed by a specialist licensed by the DOE and subsequently constructed by the developer. We are of the view that the respondents need not assume responsibility for the delay involved in obtaining the approval for CFO when the CEITS was not functioning in accordance with the requirements set out by the DOE, since this was not within the scope of the respondents' professional work. It must also be mentioned that the respondents' refusal to submit the application for CFO was merely in the discharge of their duty of care to the appellants in view of the project which was a special industrial project and ensuring that the CEITS functions in accordance with the standard required by the DOE.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> On the other hand, the preparation of the original layout plan and its subsequent amendments were made in the course of the respondents' professional work. These had resulted in undue delay in the completion of the industrial buildings. The question is whether the respondents had acted negligently in merely carrying out the developer's instructions. It was the developer who had authority to make decisions. This question must be answered within the purview of the scope of duty of care in the law of negligence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Scope Of Duty Of Care</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1977_1_399;"><i>Lim Kar Bee v. Abdul Latif Bin Ismail</i> [1977] 1 MLRA 399</LINK>; [1978] 1 MLJ 109, Raja Azlan Shah FCJ (as His Highness then was) referred to the common law principles of foreseeability and proximity as the principles giving rise to a duty of care. At p 414 of the judgment, His Lordship said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Foreseeability</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The threshold test in determining the existence of duty of care is that of foreseeability. The rule in the case of <i>Heaven v. Pender</i> [1883] 2 QBD 503 as quoted above envisaged that a man ought to have foreseen certain consequences if he created a real risk of them. The test is whether damage to someone in the plaintiff 's position was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's negligence. Reasonable foreseeability does not of itself lead to a duty of care and that the speech of Lord Atkin of "persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act" stressed not only on the requirement of foreseeability of harm but also that of a close and direct relationship of proximity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> By foreseeability, liability for a consequence is imposed and judged by the standard of the reasonable man that he ought to have foreseen it. In the words of the Privy Council in <i>Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v. Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)</i> [1961] AC 388, at p 423:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Closer to home, the Singapore Court of Appeal in <i>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v. Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</i> [2007] 4 SLR (R) 100 observed that the requirements of foreseeability is merely a "threshold question" that needs to be answered in every negligence claim, having regard to the facts of the case without resorting to any legal formulation. By the term "factual foreseeability" <i>Spandeck</i> takes the view that it is from a factual perspective, that the defendant ought to have known that the claimant would suffer damage from his carelessness. Being merely factual, it is not concerned with the kind and extent of losses suffered by the plaintiff and that it must not be confused with the question of remoteness of damages in tort.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In the present case, were the respondents able to foresee that the various acts or omissions complained of (arising from the preparation of the original layout plan and the subsequent amendments of the same) would lead to an undue delay in the approval of the CFO causing the appellants to suffer consequential financial loss? It was the finding of the Court of Appeal that on the assumption that the various acts and omissions complained of against the respondents were true, the respondents ought to have foreseen that such loss would occur. However, the court did not offer any reason to support the existence of reasonable foresight of damage on the part of the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We do not agree with the above finding of the Court of Appeal. We are of the view that the requirement of reasonable foreseeability has not been satisfied. As the architects for the project, the layout plan was prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions received by the respondents from the developer. The respondents were mainly responsible for the design and safety of the industrial buildings and compliance of the relevant laws. In the circumstances it would not be reasonable to impose a duty on the respondents to go into a detailed inquiry of the developer's obligations; for these are matters which are exclusively within the developer's scope of duty. This argument is further strengthened where s 2.01 of the SPAs provides that reasonable amendments to the building plan may from time to time be made by the developer or the respondents with the approval of the appropriate authorities. In this case, the issue of consent of the neighbouring landowners which triggered the delay, was well within the scope of the developer's duty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Thus applying the standards of the reasonable man, it is our view that the respondents could not have foreseen any liability for consequential financial loss to the appellants arising from their action in submitting the original layout plan and amending the same leading to the undue delay in completing the building and the issuance of the CFO. For this reason alone, the appellants' claim against the respondents for pure economic loss on the grounds of late delivery of vacant possession of their building units must fail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Referring to Questions 1, 2 and 3 posed in this appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Proximity Of Relationship Between The Parties And Public Policy</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> As rightly pointed out by the Court of Appeal, reasonable foreseeability does not of itself lead to a duty of care. The Privy Council in <i>Yuen Kun Yeu v. Attorney-General of Hong Kong</i> [1988] AC 175 held that whether or not a duty of care in negligence existed depended primarily upon foreseeability of damage, together with the existence of a close and direct relationship or proximity between the parties, and that occasionally, it would be necessary to go on to consider whether public policy requires that liability should not attach. In the same case, the Privy Council criticised the applicable law in determining duty of care in England at that time, namely the two-stage test of proximity and policy considerations laid down by Lord Wilberforce in <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i> [1978] AC 728. The reason was that Anns equated "proximity" with the reasonable foresight of damage thus giving rise to an indeterminate liability in negligence claims.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> To put it in a nutshell the preferred test is the three fold test, where the requirements of foreseeability, proximity and policy considerations must exist in any claim for negligence. The three fold test has been recognised by the House of Lords in <i>Caparo Industries Plc v. Dickman and Others</i> [1990] 2 AC 605; [1990] 1 All ER 568, as the elements giving rise to a duty of care. In the judgment of Lord Bridge in Caparo at pp 617-618, His Lordship said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The most difficult ingredient to prove in establishing a duty of care is the requirement of sufficient proximity between the claimant and the defendant. The court would have to look at the closeness of the relationship between the parties and other factors to determine sufficient proximity based on the facts and circumstances of each case. These factors are likely to vary in different categories of cases. The fact that damages sought by the claimant is pure economic loss not flowing from personal injury or damage to the property is also a factor to be considered. As has often been acknowledged, a more restricted approach is preferable for cases of pure economic loss. As such, the concepts of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance are seen as important factors to be established for purposes of fulfilling the proximity requirement. The reason for a more stringent approach taken in the claims involving pure economic loss is because such loss might lead to an indeterminate liability being imposed on a particular class of defendants, thus leading to policy issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Claim For Pure Economic Loss</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the present appeal, the Court of Appeal was also of the view that damages claimed by the appellants which were in the nature of pure economic loss were not recoverable since they were not linked to any personal injury or structural defects or damage to the property. The Court of Appeal observed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Pure economic loss refers to financial loss suffered by a plaintiff, due to the negligence of the defendant which does not arise from any physical damage to his person or property (see the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1997_4_820;"><i>Pilba Trading &amp; Agency v. South East Asia Insurance Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1997] 4 MLRH 820</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 53; [1999] 8 CLJ 403; [1998] 1 AMR 657 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_554;"><i>UDA Holdings Bhd v. Koperasi Pasaraya Malaysia Bhd &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 554</LINK>; [2009] 1 MLJ 737; [2009] 1 CLJ 329).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In the present appeal, the appellants whose buildings were not completed, claimed for the loss of progress payments made and interests. The remaining appellants claimed for losses of use and the costs of alternative buildings, loss of rental profits and incomes. It is pertinent to note that such claims do not arise from any defect in the construction of the industrial units. The nature of their claims are dissimilar to the claim for pecuniary loss in the case of <i>D &amp; F Estates Ltd And Others v. Church Commissioners For England And Others</i> [1989] AC 177 where an action was brought by the occupier of a property against the main contractor for the cost of remedial work and loss of prospective rent while the remedy work was done arising from defective workmanship of the property. The appellant's claims are also distinct from the facts in <i>Bryan v. Maloney</i> [1995] 128 ALR 163 where the High Court of Australia allowed a claim made by a subsequent purchaser of the property for financial loss involved in the decrease in the value of the property resulting from the developer's negligence in constructing the property with inadequate footing.</p>

      <b>Claim For Pure Economic Loss In Malaysia</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In Malaysia, the legal position in respect of claims for pure economic loss in the law of negligence is a little unclear. At the apex court, claims for pure economic loss were largely decided on considerations of public policy. It was held by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_166;"><i>Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa Cheng Loon &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 166</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 389; [2006] 2 CLJ 1; [2006] 2 AMR 563 (the <i>Highland Towers'</i> case) that, there can be no recovery for pure economic loss against a local authority, on grounds of public policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The law restricting claims for pure economic loss against public authorities in Malaysia has also been restated by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_554;"><i>UDA Holdings Bhd v. Koperasi Pasaraya Malaysia Bhd &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 554</LINK>; [2009] 1 MLJ 737; [2009] 1 CLJ 329. It was held there that the policy considerations laid down in the <i>Highland Towers'</i> case must necessarily refer and extend to all claims in tort, resulting in economic loss brought against local authorities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Should the same policy consideration be extended to a claim for pure economic loss against architects? This is the issue posed in Question no 4. Counsel for the appellants submitted that in Malaysia, although a claim for pure economic loss is not recoverable against a local authority on grounds of public policy (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_166;"><i>Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa Cheng Loon &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 166</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 389; [2006] 2 CLJ 1; [2006] 2 AMR 563), the law does not extend to private bodies or professionals rendering services for commercial consideration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In the <i>Highland Towers'</i> case, the plaintiffs who were the residents of Blocks 2 and 3 of the Highland Tower apartments brought a claim principally in negligence and nuisance against various parties for the injury suffered as a result of the collapse of Block 1. The local authority, Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya (MPAJ) was the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. The plaintiffs' claim against MPAJ was for contributory negligence for the loss in the value of their apartments in consequence of the collapse of Block 1. In the Federal Court, one of the questions where leave was granted to MPAJ to appeal to the Federal Court was: "whether pure economic loss is recoverable under our Malaysian jurisprudence with reference to a) negligence and b) nuisance". This issue was in relation to the plaintiffs' claim for breach of duty of care in respect of post collapse liability. The trial judge found negligence on the part of MPAJ in that after the collapse of Block 1, MPAJ failed to fulfil its obligation towards maintenance of a stream which flowed down a hill. However, the Court of Appeal set aside liability for the post collapse on grounds of jurisdiction in that the plaintiffs ought to enforce their rights by way of judicial review instead of filing the action in private law proceedings. At the Federal Court, the panel was divided on this issue. The majority (Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ and Arifin Zakaria FCJ concurring) ruled in favour of MPAJ while Steve LK Shim FCJ decided the question in favour of the plaintiffs. Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ in his judgment observed that:</p>

      <b>[52]</b> It is noted that the judgment in the <i>Highland Towers'</i> case was answered giving emphasis to considerations of public policy, in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;3.;;">s 3 of the Civil Law Act</LINK>. Nevertheless, it was clearly stated that damages in the nature of pure economic loss is recoverable in Malaysia "under limited situations". However the court was silent as regards the circumstances giving rise to such duty of care.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Claim For Pure Economic Loss In England</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> At common law, the English courts have long held the view that claims in negligence should be treated differently from other tortious claims, depending on the type of damages suffered by the plaintiff. The rule is that a duty of care can exist only in cases of damages caused to the plaintiff in person or to his property and the recovery of economic loss was only permissible to the extent that it arose directly from the physical damage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The English courts would normally apply a restrictive approach in determining claims for pure economic loss to avoid "liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class" (<i>Ultramareas Corp v. Touche</i> [1931] 255 NY 170).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Pure economic loss can be recoverable only if it flows from breach of contractual duty. The notion is that claims for pure economic loss must always fall within the purview of contractual obligations of the parties due to its pecuniary nature. To decide otherwise would undermine the principles of contract law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Recovery of pure economic loss in tort was allowed in very limited situations. Following the House of Lords' decision in <i>Hedley Byrne v. Heller</i> [1964] AC 465, an exception was made to the law restricting claims for pure economic loss in negligence action. This exception is only applicable in the existence of "special relationship" or proximity between the parties giving rise to an assumption of liability. In the absence of a contract, a defendant can be made liable for negligence if it could be proved that there was active intervention on his part in the form of advice or conduct amounting to representation which had been relied upon by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Development Of Law For Pure Economic Loss In England</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The English law of negligence has evolved over the years. These developments relate to the extent to which economic losses could be recovered independently of any contract:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> The House of Lords' decision in <i>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</i> [1991] 1 AC 398 The decision in <i>Murphy</i> governs the recent position in England determining a claim for pure economic loss in negligence. In <i>Murphy</i>, the plaintiff purchased a house from the local council. The house was built with a defective foundation. The plaintiff sold the house below market value and claimed damages against the council. It was argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the council had negligently relied on consulting engineers who had approved the design of the foundation as suitable. Applying the incremental approach, the House of Lords held that the property owner's loss namely the loss in the diminution in the value of the building was purely economic, therefore liability of the authority for damage of the kind suffered by the plaintiff can only be based on the principle of reliance. In the circumstances of the case, it was found that that there was no special proximity in the relationship of a local authority as statutory supervisor of the building operations and a purchaser of a defective building capable of giving rise to such a duty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In <i>Murphy</i>, Lord Oliver at pp 485-486 of the judgment said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>See also the approach of Lord Bridge in <i>Murphy</i> at p 481 of the judgment where he said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The above views countenanced that the English courts have taken the position that a claim for pure economic loss must not be recoverable in tort in the absence of a special relationship of proximity imposing on the defendant a duty of care to safeguard the plaintiff from pure economic loss. By the incremental approach, this special relationship of proximity must fall within the category of cases in which the law recognises a duty on the part of a defendant to take reasonable care to avoid or prevent pecuniary loss. For this reason, the plaintiff 's claim in <i>Murphy</i> was dismissed for he failed to prove the doctrine of reliance in order to establish the necessary relationship of proximity as founded by the court in <i>Hedley Byrne</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> By reason of the so called incremental approach, the three fold test of foreseeability, proximity and policy considerations as the elements giving rise to a duty of care has limited application. Lord Bridge in his judgment in <i>Caparo Industries Plc v. Dickman and Others</i> [1990] 2 AC 605; [1990] 1 All ER 568, reiterated that these three ingredients are not meant to be used as a practical test or touchstone for all cases of negligence. They are merely "convenient labels" or "descriptive phrases" and that they "are not susceptible of any such precise definition". At pp 573-574 of the judgment, he said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In a recent decision, Lord Walker in <i>Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Barclays Bank Plc</i> [2007] 1 AC 181, criticised the three fold test stated in Caparo, declaring it as "a set of fairly blunt tools". In <i>Customs and Excise Commissioners</i>, the issue before the House of Lords was whether a bank served with notice of a Mareva injunction order, owes a duty of care to the claimants who obtained the order against the defendants in civil proceedings. In answering the issue in the negative, the House of Lords adopted a multi-test, comprising assumptions of responsibility, the incremental approach and the three fold test in <i>Caparo</i> and treated the different approaches as mutually supportive rather than exclusive in their applications.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Claim For Pure Economic Loss In Singapore</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The law of negligence in Singapore is governed by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v. Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</i> [2007] 4 SLR 100. In its judgment the Court of Appeal realigned the law of negligence in Singapore. The Court of Appeal propounded a universal test to be applied by the courts in determining the existence of a duty of care in all negligence cases, regardless of whether it is physical damage or pure economic loss that has been sustained by the plaintiff and irrespective of whether the loss arose from a negligent misstatement or negligent physical act/omission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The test to determine the imposition of a duty of care was a twostage test comprising first, proximity and, second, policy considerations, which were together preceded by the threshold question of factual foreseeability. It was held that a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care arises by satisfying the preliminary question of factual foreseeability and the first stage of the legal proximity test. Policy considerations should then be applied to the factual matrix to determine whether or not to negate this duty. The two-stage test is to be applied incrementally with reference to the facts of decided cases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Position Before Spandeck</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> Even before Spandeck, there was a departure by the Singaporean courts from the English position restricting recovery for pure economic loss. The law relating to recovery of pure economic loss was substantially contained in two landmark cases of <i>RSP Architects Planners and Engineers v. Ocean Front Pte Ltd (Ocean Front)</i> [1996] 1 SLR 113 and <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers (Raglan Squire &amp; Partners FE) v. Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1075 and Another (Eastern Lagoon)</i> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 134. In both cases, the Singapore Court of Appeal used a "two-stage process" to consider, first whether there is a sufficient degree of proximity to give rise to a duty of care, and secondly, if such a degree of proximity was found, whether there is any material factor or policy which precludes such duty from arising, considering whether pure economic loss was recoverable in tort.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In the <i>Ocean Front case (supra)</i>, the Court of Appeal allowed the Management Corporation (homeowners' association) action against the developer of a condominium project for recovery of costs incurred in remedying the defects arising out of faulty construction of common property. Similarly in the <i>Eastern Lagoon case (supra)</i>, the Court of Appeal allowed the claim made by the management corporation against the architects of a condominium for the costs of rectifying defectively designed walls. Thus both cases relate to flaws in the building structure.</p>

      <b>The Facts In <i>Spandeck</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b>
      <i>Spandeck</i> involved an action in negligence filed by a contractor in a project against the Supervising Officer for economic loss that it had suffered as a result of under-certification of its works by the latter. The plaintiff was awarded a contract by the Government of Singapore to redevelop a medical facility at an army camp. Pursuant to the contract, the defendant was appointed the Superintending Officer of the project and was responsible for certifying interim payments in respect of the plaintiff 's work for the project. A dispute arose when a revised summary of tender and a cost break down submitted by the defendant did not reflect the actual value of the works to be carried out by the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had breached its duty of care by negligently undervaluing and under-certifying the plaintiff's works.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> As a matter of fact, the plaintiff novated the contract to another contractor, suffering losses in the process. By reason of the novation of the contract, the plaintiff was precluded from pursuing its right under cl 34 of the contract and to claim the under-certified amounts against the employer by way of arbitration proceeding. In view of the above, the plaintiff brought an action in tort against the defendant to pursue its losses. The issue before the court is whether the defendant could be held liable in negligence for the plaintiff's pure economic loss.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> On appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff's appeal and affirmed the finding of the High Court that there was no duty of care owed by the defendant. It was held that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirement of sufficient proximity in view of the existence of the arbitration clause in the contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Two-Stage Test In <i>Spandeck</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>a. "Sufficient Legal Proximity"</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The first stage of proximity required "sufficient legal proximity" between the claimant and defendant for a duty of care to arise. The focus is on the closeness of the relationship between the parties, including physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, supported by the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>b. Policy Considerations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> If a positive answer to the threshold question of factual foreseeability and the first stage of proximity was assumed, a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care arises. Policy considerations, such as the presence of a contractual matrix which clearly defined the rights and liabilities of the parties and their relative bargaining positions then arise and they are applied to the factual matrix to determine whether or not to negate this <i>prima facie</i> duty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>c. Incremental Approach</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The two-stage test is not exclusive since it must be advocated by the incremental approach the two-stage test is to be applied incrementally with reference to the facts of decided cases. However, the absence of a factual precedent in analogous situations of proximity and/or policy considerations should not preclude the court from extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking into account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate liability against a tortfeasor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> It could be observed that the ingredients giving arise to the existence of a duty of care as expounded in <i>Spandeck</i> are not dissimilar to the law in England. Applying the incremental approach, both jurisdictions take a restrictive approach in the development of the law of negligence. Nevertheless, unlike the decisions in <i>Caparo</i> and <i>Murphy</i>, <i>Spandeck</i> took a step further by recognising these ingredients of foreseeability, proximity of relationship and policy consideration as general principles that will serve as a guide for all cases. Hence general principles are to be applied for a smooth evolution of the law of negligence, such that it is not unduly hampered by an over-reliance on precedents as happened in England.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> As a matter of interest, <i>Spandeck</i> imposes a "single test" or universal test in all negligence cases which makes all claims for damages arising from negligent conduct now becoming more restricted, regardless of whether the plaintiff sustained physical damage or pure economic loss, and irrespective of whether the loss arose from a negligent misstatement or negligent physical act/omission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> The principles laid down in <i>Spandeck</i> have been applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <i>Tan Juay Pah v. Kimly Construction Pte Ltd and Others</i> [2012] SGCA 17, a construction building dispute. <i>Spandeck</i> is also being applied as a general principle in establishing duty of care in other negligent cases eg: <i>Go Dante Yap v. Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG</i> [2011] SGCA 39 on the liability of banks on the losses suffered by its client on the latter's investments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Malaysian Position</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> In Malaysia, a call was made by the apex court of the country to not follow English law as propounded by <i>Murphy</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> In the <i>Highland Towers'</i> case, Steve LK Shim FCJ (dissenting) who ruled in favour of the plaintiff on the issue of recoverability of pure economic loss, reviewed the House of Lords' decision in <i>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</i> and concluded that a claim for pure economic loss is recoverable in negligence in English Law on two alternate bases, namely the "categorisation approach" and "open ended approach". By the former, the courts determine whether the facts and circumstances of the plaintiff's claim fall into a recognised category of liability such as assumption of liability. In the absence of a recognised category of liability, the courts shall resort to the "open-ended approach" by a close examination of the facts and circumstances of the case to determine whether a duty of care should nevertheless be owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. In Steve LK Shim FCJ's view, the two approaches may overlap. His Lordship added that other Commonwealth jurisdictions namely Australia, Singapore and New Zealand have adopted the "open-ended approach" in which the recoverability of claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases is dependent on the facts of individual cases. Nevertheless, in his view, caution should be exercised in extending the principle in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> [1932] AC 562 to new situations with regard to claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases. His Lordship observed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> However, the majority decision (in the <i>Highland Towers'</i> case) reserved their view as to the approach to be adopted by the courts in Malaysia in dealing with claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases. As stated earlier, the judgment of Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ was confined to issues of public policy on the liability of a local authority, ie the MPAJ in an action for negligence for pure economic loss. His Lordship further observed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> The policy approach taken by the majority view probably could be explained by the common stand of the parties, in that action, on recovery of pure economic loss which is permissible in the law of negligence and that the actual dispute was merely on the application of the law to the facts of the case. On that premise, Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> The Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_553;"><i>Lim Teck Kong v. Dr Abdul Hamid Abdul Rashid &amp; Anor</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 553</LINK>; [2006] 3 MLJ 213; [2006] 1 CLJ 391; [2006] 2 AMR 108, also shared the same view with Steve LK Shim FCJ that is, for the Malaysian courts to depart from English law in respect of claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases. It was held by way of <i>obiter</i>, that in building construction disputes, a claim for pure economic loss be recovered in a claim for negligence and that it should be confined to injuries suffered due to defective buildings and structures. His Lordship said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> However, the above decision was merely obiter since it was the finding of the court that the claim in that case could not be categorised as pure economic loss.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> As a matter of interest it can be seen that as regards the proper approach that should be used in imposing a duty of care, legal thinking has been divided between the use of general principles as a test for duty, and the incremental approach which calls for the development of the law in incremental stages by using precedents as the yardstick against which all claims in negligence should be measured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In the present appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants' claim after applying elements of policy considerations to the facts of the case. It was held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> In other words, the imposition of policy considerations requires some measure of public policy to be infused in the establishment of a duty of care. In the present appeal, we agree with the Court of Appeal that the court must give consideration to the presence of a contractual matrix between the developer and purchasers which clearly defines the rights and liabilities of parties and their relative bargaining positions. There can be no action against the architects if the remedy asked for is specifically provided for in the contract. Otherwise, it has the effect of rewriting the contractual terms. Such claims must be dismissed on grounds of policy. Nevertheless, we must reiterate that a claim for negligence must be brought within the scope of duty of care. The recoverability of claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases is dependent on the facts of individual cases. Some measures of public policy must be considered though it should not be the sole determinant of liability.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> We are also in agreement with the submissions of counsel for the respondents that it would also be against public policy to impose on the architects a duty to deliver vacant possession of buildings within the developer's contractual period. In our view, this would only serve to compromise or even impede their professional duty in ensuring that the building laws are observed and that the structure of the building is safe.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> Thus we come to Question no 4:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> It would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose on the architects a duty of care for a responsibility which they had not assumed or one which is not within their professional scope of duty. We are of the view that in this case, the requirements of reasonable foreseeability has not been satisfied. As the architects for the project, the layout plan was prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions received by the respondents from the developer. The respondents were mainly responsible for the design and safety of the industrial buildings and compliance of the relevant laws. The appellants' claims do not fall within the scope of work of the respondents. Thus applying the standards of the reasonable man, the respondents could not have foreseen any liability for consequential financial loss to the appellants when there was a delay in the completion of the building and the issuance of the CFO. For this reason alone, the appellants' claims against the respondents for pure economic loss on grounds of late delivery of vacant possession of their building units must fail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> Claims for pure economic loss in negligence cases must always be brought within the scope of duty of care. The court should exercise caution when determining the existence of a duty of care and allowing claims for pure economic loss. In determining the existence of a duty of care in such cases, much would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> In the circumstances, we dismiss this appeal with costs.</p>
