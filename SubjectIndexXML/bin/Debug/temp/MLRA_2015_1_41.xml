    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant had garnished the deceased's money but had been ordered by the Court of Appeal to repay the deceased. The appellant had appealed against the order and claimed that he had obtained a stay of the same. Meanwhile, the respondents - administrators of the deceased's estate - issued a Bankruptcy Notice against the appellant. The SAR refused to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice and the appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was not in dispute: (i) that the Bankruptcy Notice was filed some three months before the respondents were appointed administrators of the deceased's estate; (ii) the sealed court order appointing the respondents as administrators had not been extracted at the date of hearing of the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Malaysian courts have repeatedly recognised the rule that an administrator must have the sealed order of the High Court before commencing any legal proceedings in court. This strict rule has been whittled down in exceptional cases where the administrator can show special circumstances. However, the facts in the instant case did not attract the application of the special circumstances concept. (paras 12-13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The test for <i>locus standi</i> in administration proceedings must be for the purpose of protection and preservation of the estate's assets. This court could not see how instituting bankruptcy proceedings against a purported debtor of the estate would fall within the restrictive test. A bankruptcy proceeding could not be said to be for the purpose of protecting and preserving the deceased's estate's assets. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Bankruptcy Act 1967</LINK> only gives <i>locus standi</i> to a creditor and not to an administrator who has not extracted the sealed order, unless <i>locus standi</i> has been condoned by an order of court. Bankruptcy proceedings are quasi-penal proceedings. Consequently, the strict letter of the law needs to be followed failing which a breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> may occur.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant (judgment debtor) appeals against the decision of the High Court which did not allow the appellant's appeal against the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar (SAR) who refused to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice on the ground that when the Bankruptcy Notice was issued by the respondent as administrators of the deceased estate, the Letters of Administration was not extracted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The strict rule is that the Letters of Administration must be issued by the High Court to the administrator and/or administratrix before any action can be taken for the benefit of the estate. [See <i>Janab's Key To Civil Procedure</i>, 5th edn pp 143 and 144]. Some limited exceptions are found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;15;SN6A.;;">O 15 r 6A of RC 2012</LINK>. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1968_1_386;"><i>Ang Hoi Yin v. Sim Sie Hau</i> [1968] 1 MLRH 386</LINK>; [1969] 2 MLJ 3, the plaintiff's administratrix brought an action against the defendant without having extracted the letters of administration even though it had been granted by the court. The defendant entered a conditional appearance and applied to the court to set aside the writ on the ground that the plaintiff had not acquired the <i>locus standi</i> yet. The court held that since the plaintiff had not extracted the grant of letters of administration, she had no power to sue as administratrix and therefore the suit was a nullity and must be set aside.</p>
    <p>The strict rule recently had been whittled down by the Federal Court to say if there are 'special circumstances' the administrator will have locus to proceed with the legal proceedings. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_307;"><i>Al Rashidy Kassim &amp; Ors v. Rosman Roslan</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 307</LINK>; [2007] 4 MLJ 297; [2007] 3 CLJ 361]. This is notwithstanding the strict provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39(1) of the Probate and Administration Act 1959</LINK> which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It must be noted that the 'corporation' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39</LINK> means 'Official Administrator'. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_97;39.;;">s 39</LINK>, the law vest the right to sue and be sued to the 'Official Administrator'. If anybody inter meddles with the estate of the deceased the 'Official Administrator' can be requested to take action. If he fails the interested parties can sue the 'de son tort' and also name the 'Official Administrator' as one of the defendants to obtain appropriate orders against the '<i>de son tort</i>' in the presence the 'Official Administrator though the 'Official Administrator' cannot be sued for the liability of the estate, etc. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_494;"><i>Selvarajah &amp; Anor v. Official Administrator &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 494</LINK>; [1978] 2 MLJ 108]. The Federal Court's decision of Al Rashidy did not at all discuss the section when by judicial fiat it had created exception to well established principles of <i>Ingall v. Moran</i> followed in Malaysia. In any event this court is bound by the decision of the Federal Court notwithstanding the exception to the rule is against the intent and spirit of the statute. [See <i>Jayasena v. R</i> [1970] AC 618; <i>Ingall v. Moran</i> [1944] 1 KB 160].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> When 'special circumstances' are relied on the burden will be on the purported administrator to demonstrate on the issue of locus standi in the proceedings or by way of affidavits as the case may be before obtaining any orders from the court. In essence, those who rely on special circumstances do not <i>per se</i> have a legal right such as administrator lawfully appointed by the court, with the sealed order extracted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In light of <i>Al Rashidy</i>'s case the courts will not ordinarily grant locus unless it can be shown that it was necessary and expedient to protect and preserve the interest of the deceased estate. In view of the statute which deals with Probate and Administration of Estates, the threshold for the purported administrator is very high to satisfy the <i>locus standi</i> test. It all depends on the facts, circumstances, urgency of the matter, etc. The reason why Letters of Administration must be obtained before commencement of the action for the benefit of estate is well established and the jurisprudence need not be set out here. However, now the Rules of Court provides limited orders to be granted for the estate to be represented in an action or pending action as the court may think fit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned High Court Judge had written a 17-page judgment setting out the facts in detail. We do not wish to labour on what has been said save to deal with the core issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondents are administrators of the deceased, Shahrani bin Abdullah. It is not in dispute the appellant has filed an action against the deceased while he was alive. Subsequent to the action, the appellant had garnished the money of the deceased amounting to RM2,026,536.38. The issue of garnishment was appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal had ordered the appellant to repay the money. The appellant is seeking leave to appeal against the said order to the Federal Court. Subsequent to the order, the appellant had obtained a stay of all proceedings in the High Court from the Court of Appeal before a different corum. Before us the appellant argues that the first order of the Court of Appeal was stayed. The respondent says only the matters in the High Court was stayed and not the first Court of Appeal order or the Bankruptcy Action which is a different action relating to recovery only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In essence there is <i>prima facie</i> a dispute as to whether the first order of the Court of Appeal was stayed more so when the 2nd order of the Court of Appeal was sought by the appellant they have specifically asked for the first order of the Court of Appeal to be stayed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the issue of Bankruptcy Notice, it is not in dispute that the Bankruptcy Notice was filed on 4 September 2012 three months before the appointment of the respondent as administrators for the estate of the deceased. At the date of hearing of the appeal, learned counsel conceded that even though the court has granted order in terms of the application for the respondents to be appointed as administrators the sealed copy of the order had not been extracted as at 28 November 2012, ie the date of hearing of this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Learned Counsel for the respondent agrees with the proposition laid out by the appellant and relies heavily on cases which had whittled down the strict rule enunciated in <i>Ingall v. Moran</i> [1944] 1 KB 160. And attempts to argue on the facts of the case they have <i>locus standi</i> to pursue with the Bankruptcy proceeding notwithstanding the fact in our view:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We have read the appeal records, the submissions of the parties in detail. We thank the counsel for the comprehensive submission. After much consideration to the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents, we take the view the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In our view, the facts of that case and the present case has no resemblance to attract the 'special circumstances' concept. In <i>Al-Rashidy</i>, the Federal Court on the facts held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We agree with the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned Judicial Commission was wrong in relying on <i>Kosma</i>'s case in the application of 'special circumstances' concept. The test for administration proceeding for <i>locus standi</i> must be at least for the purpose of protection and preserving the estate's assets. We do not see how by instituting a bankruptcy proceedings against a purported debtor of the estate will fall within the restrictive test. In addition, in the instant case the appellant is also claiming a sum of more than what he has to return to the estate in consequence of the court order. It may have been different if the appellant as debtor is attempting to dissipate his property to defeat the deceased estate claim. On such facts it may be quite possible to attract the 'special circumstances' concept. A bankruptcy proceeding cannot be said to be for the purpose of protecting and preserving the deceased's estates' assets.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In addition, the Bankruptcy Act only gives <i>locus standi</i> to a creditor and not to an administrator who has not extracted the sealed order, unless the issue of <i>locus standi</i> has been condoned by order of court. Bankruptcy proceedings are quasi penal proceedings. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_2_349;"><i>Sobri Arshad v. Associated Tractors Sdn Bhd</i> [1991] 2 MLRH 349</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 32; [1991] 3 CLJ 756]. In consequence, strict letters of the law need to be followed failing which it may breach <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> For reasons stated above the appeal is allowed with costs of RM15,000.00 here and below. The Bankruptcy Notice is set aside. Deposit is refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
