    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against her conviction and sentence for trafficking in methamphetamine. At the material time, the appellant had been detained by SP2 and SP4, who were police officers on duty at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, after SP4 felt a bulge in the waist area of the appellant when a cursory body search was conducted. Subsequently, SP4 conducted a full body search on the appellant, during which she found that the appellant was wearing a girdle ('the girdle'). Upon further inspection, plastic packets containing substances, which were later, confirmed to contain methamphetamine ('the drugs') were found sewn onto the girdle. In this appeal, the appellant's main ground of appeal centered on the approach taken by the trial judge in evaluating the defence, which the appellant contended was wrong in law, in particular the trial judge's treatment of the defence as a mere denial and in requiring the presence of the appellant's children in court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the defence of the appellant could not be said to be a mere denial. Further, the approach of the trial judge in requiring the children of the appellant to be present in court was an erroneous approach. However, looking at the evidence in totality, the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and the defence had failed to raise a doubt on the prosecution's case. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The prosecution and the defence had given two divergent versions of the events that took place leading to the discovery of the drugs and the arrest of the appellant. In this regard, the trial judge who had heard and seen the witnesses chose to accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses over the evidence of the appellant. It was trite that the credibility of witnesses was entirely a matter within the domain of the trial judge. In this instance, there was absolutely no reason for SP4 to tell lies against the appellant. Even if there was no evidence on the conduct of the appellant to show her guilty mind, the more critical evidence on the conduct of the appellant, would be her conduct in the examination room, when SP4 was alone with the appellant to conduct a full body search. (paras 15-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Even without the evidence on conduct, the fact remained that the appellant was caught with the drugs on her person, concealed in a girdle worn by her. In the instant appeal, there was no cogent reason to disturb the finding of the trial judge, as there were overwhelming evidence to show that the appellant carried the drugs and had concealed the drugs in the girdle. Hence, the prosecution had proved mens rea possession and trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK>.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged at the High Court Shah Alam for trafficking in 755.8 grams of methamphetamine, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The prosecution's case rests on the testimonies of C/Insp Mohideen bin Hasim (SP2) and Kpl/W Suhaini (SP4), who were on a routine duty at the arrival hall of KLIA. It was the evidence of SP4 that she felt a bulge in the waist area of the appellant when a cursory body search was conducted on the appellant. SP4 informed SP2 of her suspicions. SP2 directed SP4 to conduct a full body search on the appellant in an examination room. According to SP4 (who was the only female officer on duty on the material day), the appellant was reluctant to follow her to the examination room and while in the examination room, the appellant knelt and pleaded with SP4 not to search her. Upon the body search by SP4, she found a girdle (exh P20) worn by the appellant. SP4 called SP2 who was outside of the room. SP2 entered the room and he saw the girdle at the waist of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> SP4 examined the girdle and she noticed five sewn areas with protruding features. SP4 opened the stitches of the protruding areas from where she recovered five plastic packets containing substances. The chemist (SP3) later confirmed that four out of the five plastic packets contained methamphetamine.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case the learned trial judge stated that (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 4 pp 311-313):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The learned trial judge found that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case. The appellant was called upon to enter her defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant gave evidence under oath. Her version was diametrically opposite the prosecution's version. The appellant denied that she was examined by SP4. According to the appellant, somebody else with a different complexion and attire had examined her. The appellant further denied that the girdle was found on her. Her version was that the girdle was recovered from her bag which she had left unattended in the washroom. She had also challenged the prosecution's version on her conduct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned trial judge's finding on the defence was as follows (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 4 pp 316-317):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant was thus convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the appellant canvassed only one ground of appeal, namely that the learned trial judge erred in law when His Lordship failed to adequately and sufficiently appreciate the defence case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In particular, the complaint of learned counsel was that the learned trial judge misdirected himself in the following areas:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was submitted by learned counsel that the learned trial judge's finding that the appellant led no evidence to rebut the presumption of trafficking amounted to no consideration at all of the evidence given by the appellant on oath, which evidence was tested by the prosecution. Further, it was submitted that in requiring the children of the appellant to be present in court before the appellant could be believed, the learned trial judge had erred in his approach as it was akin to requiring the defence to produce credible evidence or to call witnesses before the defence could be considered. The correct approach, argued learned counsel, was for the learned trial judge to ask whether the appellant's version that her trip was sponsored by her children was reasonable and could be believed. In support of the above argument, learned counsel relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1965_1_233;"><i>Er Ah Kiat v. PP</i> [1965] 1 MLRA 233</LINK>; [1965] 2 MLJ 238, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_608;"><i>Pang Chee Meng v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 608</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 137; [1992] 1 CLJ 265, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_114;"><i>Davender Singh Sher Singh v. PP</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 114</LINK>; [2012] 3 AMR 489.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Learned counsel had also submitted on the learned trial judge's failure to allude to the issues raised at the end of the defence case which included the contradictions between the evidence of SP2 and SP4 on the alleged conduct of the appellant in attempting to evade the body search. Learned counsel contended that the omission by the learned trial judge had occasioned a failure of justice. Finally learned counsel submitted that the conviction of the appellant for trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2)</LINK> ought to be set aside and substituted for possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39A.;;">s 39A(2) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The ground of appeal centred on the approach taken by the learned trial judge in evaluating the defence, which learned counsel contended was wrong in law, in particular in His Lordship's treatment of the defence as a mere denial and total lies and in requiring the presence of the appellant's children in court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> While we agreed with learned counsel that the defence of the appellant could not be said to be a mere denial as she had given her explanation on how the girdle was said to be in her bag and that the approach of the learned trial judge in requiring the children of the appellant to be present in court was an erroneous approach, looking at the evidence in totality, we found that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and that the defence had failed to raise a doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The prosecution and the defence had given two divergent versions of the events that took place leading to the discovery of the drugs and the arrest of the appellant at the KLIA. In this regard, the learned trial judge who had heard and seen the witnesses chose to accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses over the evidence of the appellant. In accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and in making a finding on the credibility of SP2 and SP4, His Lordship had referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1962_1_79;"><i>PP v. Mohamed Ali</i> [1962] 1 MLRH 79</LINK> wherein it was stated that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It is trite that the credibility of witnesses is entirely a matter within the domain of the trial judge (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_7;">Dato' Mokhtar Hashim &amp; Anor v. PP [1983] 1 MLRA 7</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 232; [1983] CLJ (Rep) 101, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_483;"><i>PP lwn. Muhd Zulkifli Abd Ghani &amp; Satu lagi</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 483</LINK>; [2011] 2 CLJ 772, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_443;"><i>Selvam Arjunan v. PP</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 443</LINK>; [2012] 4 MLJ 755). The learned trial judge had stated that there was absolutely no reason for the prosecution witnesses to lie against the appellant, an old lady. We agreed with the learned trial judge. In particular, SP4 who was on a routine duty at the arrival hall of KLIA had no motive to testify against the appellant. There was no reason for SP4 to state that she had conducted the body search on the appellant; that she had found the girdle worn by the appellant and that the appellant had pleaded with her not to examine the appellant, if that was not the case (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1976_1_562;"><i>PP v. Datuk Haji Harun Bin Haji Idris (No 2)</i> [1976] 1 MLRH 562</LINK>; [1977] 1 MLJ 15.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Learned counsel had submitted that there were contradictions between the evidence of SP2 and SP4 on the conduct of the appellant. SP2 testified as follows (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 1: p 37):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Even if we were to accept that there was no evidence from SP2 on the conduct of the appellant to show her guilty mind, the more critical evidence on the conduct of the appellant, in our view, would be the conduct of the appellant in the examination room. SP4 who was alone with the appellant when a full body search was done in the examination room gave the following evidence (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2 p 137):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Even without the evidence on conduct, the fact remained that the appellant was caught with the drugs on her person, concealed in a girdle worn by her. We were mindful of the challenge made by the defence on the recovery of the girdle, but as discussed above, the learned trial judge had accepted the prosecution's version and had found that the girdle was worn by the appellant. We found no cogent reason to disturb the finding of the learned trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> There was thus overwhelming evidence to show that the appellant carried the dangerous drugs into KLIA and had concealed the drugs in the girdle. The prosecution, in our judgment, had proved <i>mens rea</i> possession and trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Based on all the above, we found the conviction of the appellant safe. We unanimously dismissed the appeal. The conviction and sentence of the High Court were affirmed.</p>
