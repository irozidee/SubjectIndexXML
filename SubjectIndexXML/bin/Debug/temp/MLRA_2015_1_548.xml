    <p>This was an appeal by the appellant against the High Court's decision allowing the respondents' claim against the appellant for breach of a sale and purchase agreement of the respondents' land ('SPA') and the dismissal of his counterclaim therein. The main issue was whether the respondents' action against the appellant was time-barred under the<LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;"> Limitation Act 1953 ('the Act')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondents' cause of action was for breach of contract, ie the SPA, and not for recovery of land. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Act</LINK>, actions founded on contract must be filed within six years of the date the cause of action accrued, which would be six years from the date the breach occurred (<i>Nasri v. Mesah</i>). The applicable provision was <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(a)</LINK> and not <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> as contended by the respondents. The breach in this case occurred when the appellant failed to apply for the consent of the State Authority for the transfer of the land and when he failed to pay the balance of the purchase price. (paras 26-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The SPA was signed on 8 September 1992. Under the SPA, the appellant was obliged to pay the balance purchase price within three months (or a further one month extension as the case might be) of the date the consent of the State Authority was obtained. The obligation to apply for the State Authority's consent to transfer the land rested with the appellant. The evidence showed that the State Authority's consent was not procured or even applied for. Also, that there was no payment for the balance purchase price or any feedback from the appellant as regards the process of transfer of the land for the last 20 years. Despite being fully aware that the appellant's conduct amounted to a breach of the SPA, especially since time was of the essence of the agreement, the respondents chose not to exercise their right to terminate the agreement that they were entitled to under the SPA. The respondents instead waited until 2012 before instituting the present suit to seek, amongst others, a declaration that the SPA was no longer valid in law. In doing so the respondents were clearly caught by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> and time-barred. The learned judge erred in failing to consider the issue of limitation as it was patently clear from the facts that limitation had set in at the time the writ was filed. (paras 29-36)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant (the defendant) against the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner who had, after a full trial, allowed the respondents' (the plaintiffs) claim as per para 20(a) to (e) of their statement of claim and dismissed the appellant's counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> After hearing submissions from both parties, we allowed the appeal on both the main claim and the counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Our reasons appear below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> For the purpose of this judgment the appellant and respondents will be referred to as the defendant and plaintiffs respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th plaintiffs together with one, Mohtar bin Abdullah were at the material time the registered owners of a plot of land held under PM No 256, Lot 13648, Kg Sg Kayu Ara, Mukim Sungai Buloh, District of Petaling, State of Selangor Darul Ehsan (the said land).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> After the death of Mohtar bin Abdullah, his share of the land was vested in the name of his beneficiaries namely, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th plaintiffs. Sometime in 1992, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th plaintiffs together with Mohtar bin Abdullah entered into a sale and purchase agreement with the defendant for the sale of the said land at the price of RM200,000.00. The parties had appointed En Khairuddin bin Sulaiman (DW2) as their joint solicitor (the solicitor) to attend to the transaction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The solicitor drafted the sale and purchase agreement (SPA) and the same was executed by the parties on 8 September 1992. The SPA contained the following salient terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The defendant paid the deposit of RM70,000.00 as required under the SPA and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th plaintiffs and the late Mohtar bin Abdullah delivered the original issue document of title to the solicitor. On or about 14 September 1993, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th plaintiffs and the late Mohtar Abdullah executed a Power of Attorney in favour of the defendant to deal with the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Sometime after the execution of the SPA, the defendant was adjudicated a bankrupt and consequently was unable to perform the contract due to his incapacity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the circumstances the plaintiffs contended that the defendant had at all material times failed and/or neglected to perform the terms and conditions of the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The plaintiffs further averred when they had not been paid the balance purchase price, the 2nd plaintiff (PW1) went to look for the solicitor to enquire as to the status of the transaction. However as the solicitor was no longer in practice the plaintiffs were unable to locate him. The plaintiffs then proceeded to revoke the Power of Attorney and instituted the present suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The defendant meanwhile lodged a private caveat on the said land on 12 November 2010 vide caveat presentation No 4173/2010.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The plaintiffs in the present suit are seeking, <i>inter alia</i> the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The defendant on the other hand pleads in para 7 of his defence that he paid the balance purchase sum of RM130,000.00 to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th plaintiffs and the late Mohtar bin Abdullah and following that the original title to the said land was handed over to the defendant by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th plaintiffs and the late Mohtar bin Abdullah. The defendant further pleads that following the payment of the sum of RM130,000.00 the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th plaintiffs and the late Mohtar bin Abdullah had given a general Power of Attorney in favour of the defendant to deal with the said land. The defendant avers that the Power of Attorney is irrevocable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The defendant further contended that the plaintiffs have unlawfully revoked the Power of Attorney and that the plaintiffs have fraudulently obtained a duplicate issue document of title. The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs and sought various declaratory orders and damages as well as costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner, at the conclusion of the trial found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He accordingly dismissed the defendant's counterclaim and entered judgment for the plaintiffs for their claim as per paras 20(a) to (e) of the statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The sole issue before us was whether the plaintiffs' claim was barred by limitation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The defendant had in para 27 of their defence and counterclaim raised the issue of limitation. Paragraph 27 reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In his submission learned counsel for the defendant contended that as the plaintiffs' cause of action is based on a breach of the SPA, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act 1953 (the Limitation Act)</LINK> should apply and as such the plaintiffs' claim was clearly time-barred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The plaintiffs on the other hand contended that they were not time barred as time begins to run only from the moment there is a threat to the plaintiffs' right to transfer the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The plaintiffs rely on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1970_1_363;"><i>Nasri v. Mesah</i> [1970] 1 MLRA 363</LINK>; [1971] 1 MLJ 32 in which the Federal Court, whilst holding that in the case of actions founded on contract, time runs from breach, in the case of actions founded on any other right, time runs from the date on which that right is infringed or there is threat of its infringement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In the present case the plaintiffs contended that they encountered several threats to their rights over the said land such as the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It was the plaintiffs' contention that in light of the above, time begins to run only from 12 July 2011, ie the date the plaintiffs discovered the caveats lodged on the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> As <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9 of the Limitation Act</LINK> stipulates that any action to recover land must be brought within 12 years of the date on which the right of action accrued to him, the plaintiffs were of the view that they were well within time when they filed this action in 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> With due respect to learned counsel for the respondent, we are unable to agree with his submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is clear from the plaintiffs' statement of claim that the plaintiffs' cause of action is for breach of contract, (ie the SPA) and not for recovery of land. This can be seen from the following paragraphs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Thus the applicable provision is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act</LINK> and not <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9</LINK> as contended by the plaintiffs. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)</LINK>, actions founded on contract must be filed within six years of the date the cause of action accrued, which according to <i>Nasri v. Mesah</i>, would be six years from the date the breach occurred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In this case the breach occurred when the defendant failed to apply for the consent of the State Authority for the transfer of the said land and when he failed to pay the balance of the purchase price as provided for under cl 3 of the SPA read together with the Schedule. The defendant however took almost 12 years after the breach occurred before filing this present suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The SPA was signed on 8 September 1992. Under cl 3 of the SPA (read together with the Schedule), the defendant was obliged to pay the balance purchase price of RM130,000 to the solicitor as stakeholder within three months (or a further one month extension as the case may be) of the date the consent of the State Authority is obtained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is not in issue and accepted by the learned judge that the obligation to apply for the State Authority's consent to transfer the said land rests with the defendant. The learned judge found that based on the solicitor's (DW2) testimony "the State Authority's consent was never procured." In fact according to the learned judge "there is no evidence that the consent to transfer was ever applied for."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> PW2 (Kamaruzaman bin Abdullah) in his evidence in chief averred that the "urusan jual beli hartanah tersebut telah tertangguh terlalu lama, selama lebih kurang 20 tahun." PW2 went on to state that during that period "plaintif-plaintif tidak pernah menerima apa-apa pembayaran penuh mahu pun maklum balas daripada defendan untuk proses pindah milik hartanah tersebut."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It was further averred by PW2 that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The above evidence confirms the plaintiffs' case that they have not (allegedly) for the last twenty years received any payment for the balance purchase price nor any feedback from the defendant as regards the process of transfer of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Despite being fully aware that the defendant's conduct as such amounted to a breach of the SPA, especially since time is the essence of the agreement under the SPA (cl 10), the plaintiffs chose not to exercise their rights to terminate the agreement which they are entitled to under cl 4 of the SPA. Instead the plaintiffs waited until 2012 before instituting this suit to seek, amongst others a declaration that the SPA is no longer valid in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We find that in doing so the plaintiffs were clearly caught by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act</LINK> and the plaintiffs' claim was therefore time barred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In our view, the learned judge erred in failing to consider at all the issue of limitation as it was patently clear from the facts that limitation had set in at the time the writ was filed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We accordingly allowed the defendant's appeal in respect of the main claim and set aside the learned judge's decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> As regards the counterclaim, the defendant had prayed for the following reliefs against the plaintiffs, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Following from our decision above, we allowed the defendant's appeal against the dismissal of his counterclaim. We therefore set aside the learned judge's decision and in place thereof we grant order in terms of prayers (a), (c), (d), (e), (h), (k), (l) and (m).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Prayer (e) is limited only to the caveats lodged by the plaintiffs and does not include any caveat lodged by a third party. Prayer (f) is thereby not allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We find no basis to award exemplary damages to the defendant hence prayers (g), (i) and (j) are not allowed. In respect of prayer (h) we order that damages be assessed by the Registrar of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We award the defendant RM30,000.00 as costs here and below and order that the deposit be refunded to the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Whilst we allowed the defendant's appeal in respect of his counterclaim, we find no reason to disagree with the learned judge's finding that the defendant failed to establish that the plaintiffs acted fraudulently when they applied for the duplicate title or when they reported the loss of the original issue document of title to the land office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We also upheld the learned judge's finding that the Power of Attorney executed by the plaintiffs in favour of the defendant is invalid as it was not authenticated in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_424;3.;;">s 3(1)(b) of the Powers of Attorney Act 1949</LINK>. The Power of Attorney was authenticated by the solicitor in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor of the High Court of Malaya. It was decidedly clear from the evidence before the court, in fact it was not disputed, that the solicitor did not have a valid practicing certificate at the time he attested the Power of Attorney. As such he did not have the capacity to attest the Power of Attorney. Hence prayer (b) of the defendant's counterclaim is not allowed.</p>
