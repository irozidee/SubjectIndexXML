    <p>The appellants had acted for Malaysian Bunkers Systems Sdn Bhd ('MBS') in respect of two suits against the respondent for monies due and owing by the respondent to MBS. MBS and the respondent subsequently entered into a consent order, the terms of which provided that the respondent pay MBS in full and final settlement a sum of RM800,000 by monthly instalments. It followed that there was a fallout between the appellants and MBS, which led to the appellants' claim against MBS for failure to settle the bills raised by the appellants for services rendered. The appellants then obtained a solicitor's lien against MBS and with the said lien served a notice of solicitor's lien against the respondent demanding that the respondent stop all instalment payments to MBS, and direct them to the appellants instead until full settlement of their claim against MBS as the appellants allegedly had a lien in respect of their fees over all monies payable to MBS. The Sessions Court and the High Court dismissed their claim and hence their appeal herein. The issues were (1) the particular nature of the solicitor's lien that the appellants asserted that they stood possessed of in the matter; (2) whether the respondent breached the notice of solicitor's lien; (3) whether the respondent breached a charge order that was allowed on the judgment sums which included costs to be recovered, ie in the proceedings handled by the appellants for MBS until settlement of the taxed costs of the appellants; and (4) whether the respondent colluded with MBS to defeat the appellant's lien for costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The appellants were not asserting a claim under a "retaining lien" (general possessory lien) but under the second category of "lien" under the common law on property recovered and in the hands of a third party (respondent) but payable to their client (MBS). The contents and language of the appellants' notice of solicitor's lien clearly showed that the appellants were only seeking the co-operation of the solicitors for the respondent to notify the respondent to desist from making any payments out on the sums due from the respondent to MBS. (paras 33-36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There did not come into existence any enforceable lien by virtue of the notice of solicitor's lien. The party asserting a solicitor's common law lien in respect of property recovered or of property to be preserved was required to obtain an injunction restraining the client receiving or the paying party from making payment without notice to the solicitor. No lien arose by a mere notice where the property to be received or preserved was to be applied towards costs of proceedings owed by MBS to their solicitors, ie the appellants. The solicitors concerned must obtain a restraining order, either against their client (from receiving) or against the party obliged to pay the client (for paying) any of the monies recovered by way of the proceedings in question. In the absence of an enforceable lien, there could not have been any breach of lien by the respondent as alleged by the appellants. (paras 37-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellants well knew in law that they had to obtain a restraining order (apart from a mere notice) against the client or against such party from whom monies were due to their client to have an effective or enforceable lien under the second category of lien. The appellants concealed the fact that they had failed to obtain from the court such a restraining order against the respondent which had to go along with a notice of solicitor's lien if it were to be valid as a lien. (para 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The respondent did not breach the charge order concerned, firstly, as the appellants' costs on solicitor-client basis (as between the appellants and MBS) had yet to be taxed at the material time. Secondly, the court did not grant any restraining order as against MBS or the respondent from receiving or effecting any further payments respectively arising from the proceedings in which the appellants had acted for MBS. It was not disputed that whatever sums due from the respondent to MBS under the relevant proceedings between them had all been released to MBS before the date of the charge order. (paras 41-43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The consent order was entered on 17 January 2005 when the appellants were still on record acting for MBS. The notice of solicitor's lien was only issued on 26 August 2005. That could not have given rise to a <i>prima facie</i> inference of collusion. The alleged compromise evidenced by the consent order was prior in time to the notice of solicitor's lien relied upon by the appellants and in any case was when the appellants were still acting for MBS. Notably, the appellants at the trial before the Sessions Court did not adduce any evidence to establish their allegation of such a collusion being in existence to defeat the appellants' right to recover their costs owed by MBS.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants had at Johore Bahru Sessions Court vide Saman No: 52-4230- 2011 brought an action to recover from the respondent a sum of RM95,338.00 (described as 'kos guaman') together with interest and costs. After a full trial, the learned Sessions Judge had on 28 September 2012 dismissed the appellants' claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> An appeal was lodged against that decision by the appellants. On 13 May 2013 the learned Judicial Commissioner of the High Court in Civil Appeal No: 12B-168-10-2012 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Sessions Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> This appeal now before us (pursuant to leave granted on 1 October 2013) was against the dismissal of the appellants' claim by both the Sessions Court and the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellants are partners in the legal firm of Tetuan Zainal and Badrol (TZB). TZB had acted for one Malaysian Bunkers Systems Sdn Bhd (MBS) in certain court proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> MBS using the services of TZB had brought two suits, one at the Sessions Court and the other at the High Court, to recover monies due to MBS from one Destination Marine Services Sdn Bhd (the respondent in this appeal) (DMS).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> MBS's Sessions Court action was Summons No: 22-67-1993 (MBS v DMS). This claim was dismissed by the Sessions Court. On appeal by MBS, the High Court vide JB High Court No: MT4-12-109-2002 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Sessions Court's dismissal of MBS's claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> MBS's High Court Suit was Guaman Sivil No: 22-68-1993 (MBS v DMS). MBS's claim was dismissed by the High Court. However on appeal by MBS, the Court of Appeal (in Civil Appeal No: J-02-1052-2001) on 28 April 2004 reversed the High Court's decision.</p>
    <p>DMS pursued the matter further and filed an application for leave to the Federal Court (Federal Court Notice of Motion No: 08-59-2004). At the hearing of the leave application on 17 January 2005 a Consent Order was entered between MBS and DMS. At this point TZB was still acting for MBS. The terms of the Consent Order essentially provided that DMS would pay MBS in full and final settlement a sum of RM800,000.00 by way of monthly instalments (backed by post dated cheques, the last of which instalment was to be on 20 September 2005).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Subsequently there was a fallout between TZB and their client MBS. TZB alleged that they had only been paid a sum of RM10,000.00 as legal fees as against six bills raised by TZB for services rendered, all of which bills were dated 20 April 2005. On 26 August 2005 TZB issued to solicitors for DMS a letter bearing the heading 'Notice of Solicitor's Lien'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> TZB then went on to file a petition to tax on a solicitor-client basis their fees as per the bills raised for the legal services rendered. This was the JB High Court Petition No: 26-08-2005(4) which cited MBS as the respondent.</p>
    <p>On 11 November 2005, Azahar Mohamed J (as His Lordship then was) allowed two orders, namely,</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> TZB served a draft copy of the Order of Court of 11 November 2005 on the same day on solicitors for DMS and demanded that DMS should stop all further instalment payments to MBS as, allegedly, TZB had now a 'lien' in respect of their fees over all monies payable to MBS.</p>
    <p>(As it would emerge later in this judgment, TZB's related Summons-in-Chamber (encl 6) application dated 29 August 2005 had applied for three orders but the High Court had only granted two of them. Further, as it would also emerge later, the High Court on 11 November 2005 did not restrain DMS by nature of an injunctive order from further paying or releasing monies to MBS)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> At this stage, for clarity, it may be summarised that TZB was involved in the proceeding for their client and subsequently against their erstwhile client, MBS, under three clusters. They were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> TZB then within JB High Court MT4-12-109-2002 (within the first cluster) by way of an application (encl 24) naming DMS as defendant/ respondent, sought to tax their legal costs on a solicitor-client basis and also to have such taxed amount to be paid by DMS. On 9 May 2006, once again Azahar Mohamed J (as His Lordship then was) dealt with this application and dismissed the same, noting as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> TZB appealed against the aforesaid decision of the 9 May 2006 vide Court of Appeal Civil Appeal No: J-4-88-2006. This appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 28 July 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Meanwhile, in Court of Appeal Civil Appeal No: J-02-1052-2001 vide encl 58(a), (within the second cluster) TZB intervened in that appeal (MBS v DMS) and obtained an order on 18 May 2006 (by a majority decision) for the taxed 'party to party' costs in the appeal (payable by DMS) be paid to TZB (towards part settlement of taxed legal costs due to TZB from MBS).</p>
    <p>There was no dispute that this order had been subsequently complied with by DMS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Further in Court of Appeal Civil Appeal No: J-02-1052-2001 TZB had also (on 9 May 2006) filed an application <i>vide</i> encl 65(a) for orders against DMS in similar terms and on similar grounds as formed the subject matter of the Sessions Court Summons No: 52-4230-2011, the action from which this appeal originated.</p>
    <p>Enclosure 65(a) was however subsequently withdrawn by TZB and was accordingly struck out by the Court of Appeal on 6 January 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Sessions Court Summons No: 52-4230-2011</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The substance of TZB's claim against DMS, as could be discerned from the Pernyataan Tuntutan filed, was found encapsulated at para 47 thereof and it was as follows:</p>
    <p>"47. Melalui notis tuntutan bertarikh 27 Jun 2011, firma guaman plaintifplaintif telah menuntut terhadap defendan jumlah sebanyak RM95,338.00 di atas alasan bahawa defendan telah melanggari notis untuk lien bertarikh 11 November 2005, Perintah mencaj bertarikh 11 November 2005 dan secara niat jahat berpakat ("collude") dengan MBS untuk menafikan hak plaintifplaintif terhadap kos tetap defendan telah gagal enggan atau dengan sengaja tidak mahu menjelaskan jumlah tersebut atau apa-apa jumlah sekalipun.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> TZB's allegation was that this was a breach committed by DMS on an alleged lien of which notice had been given, and further that there was a collusion by DMS with MBS to deprive TZB of the taxed costs in High Court Guaman Sivil No: 22-68-1993.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Learned Sessions Judge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned Sessions Judge held that all the issues raised by TZB had been conclusively determined against the TZB by the decision of Azahar Mohamed J at the High Court on 9 August 2006 in Civil Appeal No: MT4-12-109-2002, as affirmed by the Court of Appeal on 28 July 2008 in Civil Appeal No: J-04- 88-2006. The relevant part of the grounds of the Azahar Mohamed J was quoted by the learned Sessions Judge and it was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned Sessions Judge also noted that the issue of a 'lien' allegedly binding on DMS was also raised in encl 24 (filed subsequently) in MT4-12-109- 2002 and had been dismissed both by the High Court and the Court of Appeal (Civil Appeal No: J-4-88-2006).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The learned Sessions Judge further held that no evidence had been adduced by TZB to prove that there had been any collusion as between MBS and DMS to deny TZB their taxed legal fees. TZB had also failed to call any witnesses from MBS to further advance this contention of an apparent collusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> More tellingly, the learned Sessions Judge held that TZB had attempted to conceal, namely, by not producing when requested to and only making it available at trial, (upon cross-examination) the copy of the petition and related affidavits (in High Court Petition No: 26-08-2005). It was obvious from the relief sought, although TZB had applied for a restraining order to be made against DMS from releasing any further monies due to MBS, the High Court had not granted any specific order on 11 November 2005 to that extent as applied for.</p>
    <p>TZB was also found to have failed to forward the complete set of cause papers with their letter of 11 November 2005 to DMS's solicitors and this it was held was deliberately done in order to suppress the fact that no such injunctive order had been granted by the court despite it being applied for; this, the learned Sessions Judge held went to the basis or credibility of TZB's claim itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In the light of the several similar applications brought by TZB to impose liability on DMS, all of which had been dismissed against TZB, the learned Sessions Judge was of the further view that TZB's action was an abuse of the process of court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned High Court Judge was of the view that the learned Sessions Judge had not erred in dismissing TZB's claim. While endorsing all the reasons given by the learned Sessions Judge, the High Court went on to further emphasise and rely on the doctrine of <i>'res judicata'</i> and held that it applied in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Accordingly, it was held that TZB was estopped from bringing this action against DMS as all the issues pertaining to the TZB's allegations that DMS had not adhered to the notice of lien and that there was 'collusion' between DMS and MBS had all been raised and dealt with in Court of Appeal Civil Appeal No: J-04-88-2006.</p>
    <p>Those contentions of TZB had been rejected. The appeal was therefore dismissed by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Observations And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> TZB argued before us that TZB's causes of action were three-fold, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was contended that each of the aforesaid grounds/causes of action was separate and independent and TZB need only prove any one of them to succeed in their claim against DMS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> TZB also referred to a 'Federal Court Order dated 5 March 2010' which, it was contended, had 'rescinded' the High Court Order of 9 May 2006 (MT4-12- 109-2002) and the Court of Appeal Order of 28 July 2008 (J-4-88-2006). It was argued that this Order had not been considered by the learned Sessions Judge. Law On Solicitor's Lien</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The starting point will be to first appreciate the particular nature of the solicitor's lien that TZB asserts that they stand possessed of in this matter. In the leading tome, <i>Cordery on Solicitors</i>, (7th edn), the authors state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> With respect to retaining liens, the authors further comment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The commentary goes on further to state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> With respect to lien on property recovered or preserved, (also referred as 'particular' lien) it is noted in the same works that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In similar vein the author of <i>The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> edn), Tan Yock Lin states that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The author goes on to further note:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> With respect to the 'charging order' that a solicitor could obtain from the courts to prevent the fruits of his exertions being disposed of to his prejudice while his costs remain unsatisfied, Tan Yock Lin in his guiding works also goes on to state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The statutory provision referred to in the Malaysian context is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;123.;;">s 123 of the Legal Profession Act 1976 (LPA)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;123.;;">Section 123 of the LPA</LINK> was in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With respect to the meaning to be accorded to the words "the property recovered or preserved in such suit" in that provision, the author of <i>The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia</i>, further comments (citing supporting authorities):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> From the factual context surrounding this case, there was no doubt that the appellants were not here asserting a claim under a 'retaining lien' (general possessory lien) but under the second category of 'lien' under the common law on 'property' recovered and in the hands of a third party (here DMS) but payable to their client. It is noteworthy that the commentary in <i>'Cordery On Solicitors'</i> on the enforcement of such a common law lien had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Whether DMS Breached The 'Notice Of Solicitor's Lien' Dated 26 August 2005</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The key parts of the 'Notice of Solicitor's Lien' of 26 August 2005 are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Subsequent to the aforesaid letter, TZB on 29 August 2005 filed encl 6 in JB High Court vide Petition No: 26-8-Tahun 2005 (4) wherein one of the prayers sought was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(Enclosure 6 was only heard on 11 November 2005 and as discussed later in this judgment this order sought by TZB against DMS was not granted by the court).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Clearly by the contents and language of the said 'Notice of Solicitor's Lien' dated 26 August 2005, TZB was only seeking the co-operation of solicitors for DMS to notify DMS to desist from making any payments out on the sums due from DMS to MBS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It is our view that in law there did not come into existence any enforceable 'lien' by virtue of the said Notice of 26 August 2005.</p>
    <p>As pointed out above, the party asserting a solicitor's common law lien in respect of property recovered or of property to be preserved was required to obtain an injunction restraining the client receiving or the paying party from making payment without notice to the solicitor.</p>
    <p>No 'lien' arose by a mere notice (as was the case here) where the property to be received or preserved was to be applied towards costs of proceedings owed by MBS to their solicitors, TZB. The solicitors concerned had to obtain a restraining order either against their client (from receiving) or against the party obliged to pay the client (for paying) any of the monies recovered by way of the proceedings in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Our answer to the first issue was that in the absence of an enforceable lien on 26 August 2005, there could not have been any 'breach of lien' by DMS, as alleged by TZB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It was pertinent to point out here too that encl 6 and the related supporting affidavit were firstly not forwarded with the said Notice dated 26 August 2005 to the solicitors for DMS. More significantly TZB had withheld forwarding the said relevant cause papers to the solicitors for DMS despite various attempts at discovery of the said documents during the Sessions Court proceedings. As observed by the learned Sessions Judge, the cause papers were only reluctantly disclosed during the course of the trial at the Sessions Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> It was obvious that TZB well knew that in law that they had to obtain a restraining order (apart from a mere notice) against the client or against such party from whom monies were due to their client, to have an effective or enforceable 'lien' under this second category of lien. The High Court on 11 November 2005 had disallowed such a restraining order. The Sessions Court was therefore correct in our assessment (in the trial of this immediate suit) to hold in the circumstances, that TZB had wilfully suppressed this very material cause paper to conceal the fact that they had failed to obtain from the court such a restraining order against DMS which had to go along with a Notice of Solicitors Lien if it was to be valid at all as a 'lien'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether DMS Has Breached The Charging Order Dated 11 November 2005?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> As pointed out earlier (TZB's application vide encl 6) was heard on 11 November 2005 and Azahar Mohamed J (as His Lordship then was) only allowed a 'charge-order' on the judgment sums (including costs) to be recovered, that is, in the proceedings handled by TZB for MBS, until settlement of the 'taxed costs' of TZB.</p>
    <p>Firstly, at that point in time TZB's costs on solicitor-client basis (as between TZB and MBS) had yet to be taxed (the Bills of Costs were only issued on 20 April 2005 to MBS). Secondly, it behoves repetition here that the court did not grant any restraining order as against MBS or DMS from receiving or effecting any further payments respectively, arising from the proceedings in which TZB had acted for MBS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> It was not disputed that whatever sums due from DMS to MBS under the relevant proceedings between them had all been released to MBS before 11 November 2005, in any event.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In the circumstances, we were not persuaded that there had occurred a breach by DMS of the 'charging order' made by the court on 11 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether DMS Colluded With MBS To Defeat TZB's Lien For Costs?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> To recap, the learned Sessions Judge held that there was no evidence adduced by TZB to establish as a matter of fact that there had been collusion on the part of MBS and DMS to defeat TZB's supposed 'lien' for costs, in any event.</p>
    <p>The learned judge at the High Court hearing the appeal from that decision affirmed that finding, whilst also stating that the issue of 'collusion' raised by TZB had been in any case conclusively ruled against TZB by the High Court (per Azahar Mohamed J) on 9 May 2006 in JB High Court vide Suit No: MT4-12-109-2002. This decision of Azahar J had also been affirmed when TZB's appeal to the Court of Appeal vide Civil Appeal No: J-4-88-2006 was dismissed on 28 July 2008. The learned judge of the High Court in this matter was of the view that the doctrine of <i>'res judicata'</i> accordingly applied in this situation to preclude TZB from pursuing with this issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> It was TZB's contention however that the grounds of the majority decision of the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No: J-02-1052-2001 per Abdul Aziz Mohamed JCA (as His Lordship then was) had observed that there was 'evidence of collusion' between MBS and DMS.</p>
    <p>We have read the said grounds in detail and are to point out that the observation in question was made in the context of encl 58(a) in that appeal proceedings (emanating as it was from JB High Court Civil Action No: 22-68-1993) where at the leave stage before the Federal Court the Consent Order of 17 January 2005 was entered into between MBS and DMS, as earlier noted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Firstly, encl 58(a), it must be appreciated, was an application by TZB brought subsequently to obtain an order that the 'party to party' costs ordered at the Court of Appeal should be paid out to TZB directly to account of their costs recoverable from MBS. This was allowed by the majority of the learned panel hearing that application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Secondly, it must also be stated, with respect, that Abdul Aziz Mohamed JCA (as His Lordship then was) appeared to have relied, supposedly on the situation that there was a 'notice of lien' before the 'compromise' was reached between MBS and DMS without the knowledge or excluding TZB.</p>
    <p>This, it must be pointed out was not borne out by the facts surrounding this matter. The Consent Order was entered on 17 January 2005 when TZB was still on record for MBS. Further, the 'Notice of Solicitors Lien' was in any case only issued on 26 August 2005 and this could not have given rise even to a <i>'prima facie'</i> inference of 'collusion' as the judgment adverted to.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Counsel for TZB placed much reliance also on the case of <i>Price v. Crouch</i> [1891] 60 LJQB 767, in arguing that as in the case at hand before us, the court there had recognised that - (1) a notice of lien and (2) collusion was sufficient to create an enforceable 'lien'.</p>
    <p>We have also given this case our due consideration. We note that on appeal in that case (as pointed out by Abdul Aziz Mohamed JCA) it was held that a mere notice issued was not sufficient to create a 'lien'. The issue of whether there was or not 'collusion' was always a question of fact for the determination of the court.</p>
    <p>In the instant case, as already pointed out above, that there could not have arisen any 'collusion' at all as the alleged 'compromise' evidenced by the Consent Order of 17 January 2005 recorded between MBS and DMS, was prior in time to the 'Notice of Solicitor's Lien' (26 August 2005) relied upon by TZB and in any case was when TZB was still acting for MBS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Azahar Mohamed J (as His Lordship then was) had in our view, specifically dealt with this issue when TZB's application vide encl 24 in JB High Court MT4-12-109-2002 was heard and disposed on 9 May 2006. It was held that on affidavit evidence before the court it could not be concluded that there was any collusion, as alleged by TZB, between MBS and DMS to deprive TZB of their legal costs.</p>
    <p>TZB's appeal against this decision, as referred to earlier vide Court of Appeal Civil Appeal No: J-4-88-2006 was also dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 28 July 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> It is pertinent to point out that at the trial before the Sessions Court, as observed by the learned Sessions Judge, TZB had not adduced any evidence through relevant witnesses or documents to substantiate or establish their allegation of such a 'collusion' being in existence to defeat TZB's right to recover their costs owed by MBS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Federal Court Order Of 5 March 2010</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> TZB made reference to the aforesaid order rather casually and argued that this Federal Court Order had the effect of 'rescinding' the High Court Order of 9 May 2006 of Azahar Mohamed J (in MT4-12-109-2002) and the Court of Appeal Order of 28 July 2008 (in J-4-88-2006, where TZB's appeal against the High Court decision of 9 May 2006 was dismissed). We have examined the Federal Court Order of 5 March 2010 in Civil Application No: 08-63- 2006(J) and note that the Order made was in respect of a Notice of Motion filed by MBS, as it would appear, to obtain leave to appeal, arising from the decision (by majority) of the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No: J-02-1052- 2001 of 18 May 2006 (related to encl 58(a) of TZB therein to be directly paid the taxed 'party-party costs' in that appeal). The leave sought by MBS, which was not granted by the Federal Court, it must be stressed, was in the context of proceedings of a different nature and in any case there are no grounds available to justify the far reaching effect that TZB now canvasses that Federal Court Order has.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We did not see how the Federal Court Order of 5 March 2010 had any relevance to the issues at hand or how it 'rescinded' the High Court Order of 9 May 2006 and/or the subsequent dismissal on 28 July 2008 by the Court of Appeal of the appeal brought by TZB against that High Court Order. There was no application by TZB for leave to pursue with a further appeal to the Federal Court against the Court of Appeal decision of 28 July 2008. As repeatedly highlighted above, the proceedings at the High Court leading to Azhar Mohamed J's orders of 9 May 2006 (affirmed subsequently by the Court of Appeal) specifically and conclusively dealt with the issues of 'lien' and 'collusion' as now raised by TZB in the separate Sessions Court proceedings, from which this appeal before us ensued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> For the reasons discussed and elaborated above, we did not find any merits in the appeal of TZB against the concurrent decisions of the Sessions Court and the High Court. We are therefore unanimous that the appeal be dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>After further hearing counsel for appellants on 5 February 2015, we fixed RM5,000.00 as the costs payable to the respondent. Deposit was ordered to be paid to the respondent to account for costs ordered.</p>
