    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was caught by police officers while carrying a bag which was later confirmed to contain ketamine ("the said drugs"). The appellant was then charged and tried for trafficking in the said drugs, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("DDA")</LINK>. At the conclusion of the trial, the Judicial Commissioner ("JC") convicted the appellant and sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty. Aggrieved, the appellant appealed contending, <i>inter alia</i>, that the JC had erred in finding that there was trafficking in the said drugs based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> and the act of "carrying" the said drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 DDA</LINK>; and that the JC failed to consider whether the statutory presumption of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> had been rebutted. The Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, in resisting this appeal, urged the court to apply the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60(1) Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> ("<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60(1) CJA</LINK>") to dismiss the present appeal as no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The mere act of carrying the said drugs was not sufficient to constitute the offence of trafficking under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">DDA</LINK>. Trafficking in dangerous drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 DDA</LINK> entailed something more than passive possession, ie the act of 'carrying' the said drugs by the appellant from one place to another and doing so as to promote the distribution or supply of the drugs to someone else. This was never considered by the JC. In this regard, the JC did not judicially appreciate that there ought to be direct evidence of trafficking or affirmative evidence of trafficking. (<i>Ong Ah Chuan v. PP And Another Appeal (refd)</i>). (paras 8-9)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the present case, the evidence had proven that the appellant was in possession of the said drugs and that the appellant's conduct showed that he had knowledge of the said drugs. However, the JC did not make any finding to the effect that the purpose for which the appellant was in possession of the said drugs was to transfer the possession of the said drugs to someone else. The JC erred in failing to appreciate that other than an act of passive possession, there was no overt act on the part of the appellant to traffic the said drugs. Hence, this was a misdirection by the JC warranting appellate intervention. (<i>Gooi Loo Seng v. PP (refd)</i>). (paras 10-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The statutory presumption of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> was a rebuttable presumption. Thus, it was incumbent on the JC to consider at the end of the case whether the presumption invoked had been rebutted on a balance of probabilities. The JC failed to direct his mind on this point, which amounted to a serious misdirection. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> It was an established principle that the proviso in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60(1) CJA</LINK> was only to be invoked in exceptional circumstances (<i>Tunde Apatira &amp; Ors v. PP (refd)</i>). In this instance, there was nothing exceptional regarding the evidence of the present case against the appellant to form a valid reason to invoke the proviso. (para 16)</p>
    <p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Azahar Mohamed JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged and tried before the Penang High Court for trafficking in 467.65 grams of dangerous drugs, namely ketamine, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (DDA)</LINK>, and punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the DDA</LINK>. The offence was said to have been committed on 20 February 2008 at about 6.40pm at the vicinity around the block of Flats described as Blok 50, Taman Yew Lean, Jalan Slim, Georgetown, Penang.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner (JC) at the conclusion of the trial convicted the appellant and sentenced him to the mandatory death penalty prescribed by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">DDA</LINK>. Aggrieved by that decision, the appellant appealed to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The prosecution evidence presented at the trial is quite straightforward and in brief, it is as follows. Upon information received, Chief Inspector Santhanadas a/l Venugopal ("PW4") assembled a team of Narcotic police officers. He briefed them on the information and organised a raiding plan. After the said briefing, PW4 and his team proceeded to the targeted area. There, they took up ambush positions and kept a close surveillance. The area was fenced and there was only one entrance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At around 6.40pm, PW4 saw a Suzuki motor scooter bearing registration No PFJ 3214 ridden by the appellant entering the area. At that moment, PW4 observed that there was a green plastic bag being hung on the left handle of the motor scooter. The appellant then parked the motor scooter. He got off the motor scooter and took off the helmet. The appellant then took the green plastic bag from the handle and walked toward the entrance of the block of flats.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At that point, PW4 and his men ambushed the appellant and introduced themselves by shouting 'Polis'. The appellant turned around, threw the plastic bag and fled. PW4 and his men gave chase and succeeded in arresting the appellant. Thereafter, the appellant was brought to the spot where the green plastic bag was after being thrown. In the plastic bag was a brown paper package. Inside it were six transparent plastic packages containing whitish powdery substances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The six transparent plastic packages were subsequently sent to the Chemistry Department for chemical examination and analysis. They were later confirmed by the chemist, Siti Nur Azirawati bt Idris ("PW3") to contain ketamine weighing in total 467.65 grams, which formed the subject matter of the charge against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The principal ground raised by learned counsel for the appellant in this appeal was that the learned JC had erred when he found that there was trafficking based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> and the act of "carrying" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the DDA</LINK>. In his judgment, the learned JC said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It cannot be disputed that at the material time, the appellant was in fact carrying the impugned ketamine. However, the mere act of carrying is not sufficient to constitute the offence of trafficking under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">DDA</LINK>. In other words, the act of mere carrying does not make one a trafficker under the scheme of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">DDA</LINK>. This is made clear from the judgment of Arifin Zakaria FCJ (as His Lordship then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_319;"><i>PP v. Abdul Manaf Muhamad Hassan</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 319</LINK>; [2006] 3 MLJ 193; [2006] 2 CLJ 129; [2006] 4 AMR 477). That case represents the law on this subject as we apply today. In our judgment, the learned JC had misdirected himself in that there was no appreciation that to traffic in dangerous drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the DDA</LINK> entails something more than passive possession. In the context of the present case, to constitute the offence of trafficking, the act of 'carrying' ketamine by the appellant from one place to another was in the sense of doing so as to promote the distribution or supply of the impugned drug to someone else (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_283;"><i>Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor And Another Appeal</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 283</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 64). This was never considered by the learned JC and he failed to direct his mind on this point.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In deciding this issue, the point to note is that the drug involved was ketamine, which is categorised as a <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">sch 1 drug in the DDA</LINK>. It is pertinent to note that the trafficking presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the DDA</LINK> does not apply to ketamine. In this regard, a close reading of the judgment of the learned JC revealed that he did not judicially appreciate that there ought to be direct evidence of trafficking or affirmative evidence of trafficking. Likewise, the learned JC also did not recognise that the amount of ketamine is only 467.65 grams. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_179;"><i>Mohamad Yazri Minhat v. PP</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 179</LINK>; [2003] 2 MLJ 481; [2003] 2 CLJ 65; [2003] 2 AMR 404 this court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> This brings us to the submission of learned counsel that the appellant was only in passive possession of the ketamine. Nowhere in his judgment had the learned JC made a finding to the effect that the purpose for which the appellant was in possession of the ketamine he was carrying was to transfer the possession of the said ketamine to someone else. In our view, this is a serious nondirection which amounts to a misdirection by the learned JC warranting appellate intervention (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_227;"><i>Gooi Loo Seng v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 227</LINK>; [1993] 2 MLJ 137; [1993] 3 CLJ 1; [1993] 2 AMR 1135).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In our judgment, at the highest, this was a case of passive possession and not trafficking. The evidence shows that the appellant was in possession of the ketamine. This is an undisputable fact. The conduct of disposing the plastic bag, the acts of flight and struggle only show that the appellant had knowledge of the contents of the bag to be ketamine. The learned JC erred in that he failed to appreciate that other than an act of passive possession, there was no overt act on the part of the appellant to traffic the impugned drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> There is another reason why we had allowed this appeal. At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the learned JC had invoked <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK> to prove possession of the appellant of the ketamine in the plastic bag. The statutory presumption of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> is a rebuttable presumption. For this reason, it is incumbent on the learned JC to consider at the end of the whole case whether the presumption that he invoked had been rebutted on a balance of probabilities. A reading of the judgment of the learned JC shows that he had failed to direct his mind on this point. This is a serious misdirection as the law requires the learned JC to make such a finding when he resorted to the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK> (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_47;"><i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 47</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 209; [1996] 1 CLJ 705; [1996] 1 AMR 817, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_28;"><i>Tan Boon Kean v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 28</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 514; [1995] 4 CLJ 456; [1995] 3 AMR 3007 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_650;"><i>PP v. Ku Yahya Ku Bahari &amp; Anor</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 650</LINK>; [2002] 1 CLJ 113; [2002] 1 AMR 277).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In resisting this appeal, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor ("DPP") urged us to apply the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> To support his submission, the learned DPP drew our attention to the case of <i>PP v. Abdul Manaf Muhamad Hassan (supra)</i>. In that case the appellant was charged with trafficking in 62.09 grams of heroin. The drug was carried in small plastic packets each containing a small quantity of the drugs. According to the evidence, 39.77 grams of heroin was found in a number of small plastic packets tucked in his waist, while 50 small plastic rackets containing 9.09 grams of heroin was found in the right side pocket and another 30 small plastic packets containing 5.57 grams heroin was found in the left side pocket of the track top he was wearing. A total of 20 small plastic packets were found in each of the right and left pockets of his trousers, containing a total of 7.66 grams of heroin. It was against this background evidence, the Federal Court held that the appellant in that case was not just a passive carrier and as such, the proviso ought to be invoked. Arifin Zakaria FCJ (as His Lordship then was) in delivering the judgment of the Federal Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Cleary, therefore, the case of <i>PP v. Abdul Manaf Muhamad Hassan (supra)</i> relied on by the learned DPP is distinguishable on its facts. On the facts and the prevailing circumstances of the present case, we were satisfied that even if the learned JC had properly directed himself, he would have come to the finding that this was just a case of passive possession and not trafficking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It is an established principle that the proviso is only to be invoked in exceptional circumstances (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_800;"><i>Tunde Apatira &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 800</LINK>; [2001] 1 MLJ 259; [2001] 1 CLJ 381; [2001] 1 AMR 577).</p>
    <p>In the present case, the evidence does not show or prove a transfer of possession or that the drugs were to be supplied to another person. In our judgment, there was nothing exceptional regarding the evidence of the present case against the appellant; there was no valid reason for us to invoke the proviso.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> This appeal was, therefore, allowed. Accordingly, we quashed and set aside the conviction and the death sentence of the High Court and we substituted it with one of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2)</LINK> and punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(3) of the DDA</LINK>. The appellant was sentenced to five years imprisonment from the date of arrest.</p>
