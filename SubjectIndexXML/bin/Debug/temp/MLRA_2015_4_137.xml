    <p>In this appeal, a half-share in a piece of property belonged to the mother of the appellants ("NZ") and the respondent. The respondent contended that NZ, whilst alive, had created a trust over the property in favour of her granddaughter - NA - the daughter of the respondent. The respondent claimed that NZ had executed two trust instruments - exh P1 and exh P2 - appointing the respondent the trustee as well as attorney for NA. However, the appellants disputed the validity of exh P1 and exh P2 and counterclaimed alleging that the two instruments were flawed and had been fraudulently obtained. The High Court allowed the respondent's claim for <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that the two instruments, ie exh P1 and exh P2, were valid as trust instruments and powers of attorney and that the two instruments appointed the respondent as trustee and attorney for the beneficiary under the trust, <i>viz</i> NA. The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal in part:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> This court would accept the appellants' submission that both exh P1 and exh P2 were flawed and defective. Their contents were indeed confusing, contradictory and left the court uncertain as to the intention of the late NZ. The two instruments were thus void by reason of uncertainty as to their intention. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> If at all exh P1 created a trust, the trustee was NZ herself, and not the respondent. If P1 created a Power of Attorney, the donor was NZ and the donee was the respondent. The respondent was thus an attorney for NZ and not an attorney for his daughter NA. In the instant case, the respondent was not bringing the action as the attorney of or in the name of NZ. Neither was the respondent bringing the action in his capacity as the next friend of the minor, NA. (paras 18-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Counsel for the respondent contended that the Power of Attorney continued to be in force notwithstanding the death of NZ by reason of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_424;6.;;">s 6(a) of the Powers of Attorney Act 1949</LINK> since the Power of Attorney was given for valuable consideration, and that natural love and affection did, in law, constitute valuable consideration. However, it was clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;26.;;">s 26(a) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> that natural love and affection do not constitute consideration. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;26.;;">Paragraph (a) to s 26</LINK> only provides for an exception in a case of natural love and affection. It does not say that natural love and affection constitute consideration. Thus based on exh P1 alone, the respondent had no <i>locus standi</i> to bring the action on behalf of NA. (paras 25-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> If exh P2 was a trust instrument appointing the respondent as a trustee for the benefit of NA in respect of the property, then, exh P2 contradicted exh P1; since under exh P1 the late NZ was the trustee for NA and not the respondent. Since it was provided in exh P2 that in the event that exh P2 contradicted exh P1, exh P1 ought to prevail, therefore, the provision of exh P1 appointing the late NZ as the trustee of the trust for NA would prevail, meaning that exh P2 did not make the respondent the trustee for NA. At best exh P2 was merely an irrevocable Power of Attorney appointing the respondent as the attorney for the late NZ. This meant that exh P2 did not support the respondent's contention that exh P2 created a trust instrument appointing the respondent as the trustee for the benefit of NA. Exhibit P2 thus did not confer any <i>locus standi</i> on the respondent to bring the instant action as trustee or attorney of NA. (paras 34-35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> This court would agree with the trial judge that the appellants had failed to establish fraud in respect of the execution of exh P1 and exh P2 by the late NZ. However, since exh P1 and exh P2 were not valid by reason of being confusing and unclear documents and that (assuming the two instruments were valid) the respondent had no <i>locus standi</i> to bring the action, the issue of whether or not there was fraud had become somewhat academic. This court would also accept the finding of the trial judge that it had not been satisfactorily established that the late NZ was mentally fit to execute the Power of Attorney - exh D28 - and thus the appellants had failed to establish that exh D28 was a valid Power of Attorney. (paras 41-42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The appeal ought to be allowed partially. The order of the High Court in allowing the respondent's claim and totally dismissing the appellants' counterclaim ought to be set aside. Instead only prayer (d) of the appellants' counterclaim, <i>viz</i> a declaration that the disputed property be distributed in accordance with Faraid - ought to be allowed. (para 43)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal is against the decision of the High Court of Kuala Lumpur (Civil Division) dated 25 January 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the High Court the respondent's claim was allowed, and the appellants' counterclaim was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellants were two of the four defendants at the High Court, whilst the respondent was the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 11 February 2014 we have unanimously allowed the appeal in part.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We now give our grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The High Court had allowed the respondent's (plaintiff 's) prayers for, among others, a declaration that two instruments creating a trust called:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>in respect of an immovable property situated in Kuala Lumpur, namely, a double storey bungalow house in Bukit Pantai, registered in the name of one Nik Zainab binti Haji Nik Majid, are valid as trust instruments and powers of attorney; that these trust instruments appoint the plaintiff the trustee and attorney for the beneficiary; and that the beneficiary under the trust is one Nik Afrina binti Nik Rahmat.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The present appeal concerns a dispute between siblings over a piece of property - a bungalow house at Bukit Pantai, in Kuala Lumpur ('the disputed property'). A half-share in this disputed property belonged to the late Nik Zainab binti Hj Nik Majid - the mother of the parties (that is to say, the mother of the appellants/defendants and the respondent/plaintiff). What is in dispute is this half-share of the late Nik Zainab.</p>
    <p>(The other half-share in the property belonged to one Ruhinda binti Haji Mohamed - but for the purpose of this appeal, we are not concerned with this other half-share.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiff's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It is the contention of the plaintiff, Nik Rahmat, that his late mother, Nik Zainab (who was also the mother of all the other siblings, the defendants), whilst alive, had created a trust over the disputed property in favour of her granddaughter, Nik Afrina (the daughter of the plaintiff), who was three years of age then; and that, by that trust instruments, had appointed the plaintiff, the father of Nik Afrina, the trustee as well as the attorney for Nik Afrina. The plaintiff claims that the trust and Power of Attorney were created through the execution of two instruments by his late mother, Nik Zainab, during her lifetime, namely, exh P1 and exh P2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At the time when the alleged trust instruments (exh P1 and exh P2) were executed the late Nik Zainab lived with the plaintiff, the plaintiff 's wife, their daughter, Nik Afrina, and the fourth defendant, Nik Rashidah binti Wan Hassan, in the disputed property at Bukit Pantai, Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Exhibit P2 states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Nik Zainab died on 22 June 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defendants' Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The defendants contend that neither exh P1 nor exh P2 is valid on two grounds, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We begin by inquiring into the issue as to whether exh P1 and exh P2 are flawed and defective.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is the defendants' contention that exh P1 and exh P2 are flawed and defective by reason of the fact that their contents are conflicting and confusing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Findings Of This Court With Respect To The Plaintiff's Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> With respect, we accept the defendants' submission that exh P1 and exh P2 are flawed and defective. We have closely examined the contents of exh P1 and exh P2 and we find that the contents are indeed confusing, and we are uncertain as to the intention of the late Nik Zainab. What is it that she wanted to create by these two instruments: a trust or a Power of Attorney? Or both? If what is intended is to create a trust, who is supposed to be the trustee? The late Nik Zainab or the plaintiff? We find that exh P1 and exh P2 contradict each other thereby making it uncertain as to the intention of the late Nik Zainab. Thus these two instruments are void by reason of uncertainty as to their intention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> However, assuming that exh P1 and exh P2 are valid, we proceed to make the following observations and conclusions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In exh P1, in para 1, the late Nik Zainab appears to have created a trust in respect of the disputed property and appointed herself to be the trustee for the benefit of her granddaughter, Nik Afrina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> At the same time, however, in para 2 of exh P1, she appointed the plaintiff as her attorney under an irrevocable Power of Attorney, the consideration being for natural love and affection. Under the Power of Attorney, the plaintiff is given the power:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is pertinent to note that if at all exh P1 created a trust, the trustee is Nik Zainab herself, and not the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> And if at all exh P1 created a Power of Attorney, the donor is Nik Zainab, and the donee, the plaintiff; meaning that the plaintiff is an attorney for Nik Zainab and not an attorney of his infant daughter, Nik Afrina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It is important for us to highlight these facts because in the present suit the plaintiff, based on the title of the action, is bringing the action in the following capacity:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Based on the title of the action, the plaintiff is bringing the action in two capacities:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> One thing is clear though: the plaintiff is not bringing the action as the attorney or in the name of the late Nik Zainab; nor is the plaintiff bringing this action in his capacity as the next friend of the minor, Nik Afrina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Now, based on exh P1, the plaintiff is neither the trustee for, nor the attorney of Nik Afrina. The trustee for Nik Afrina is her grandmother, the late Nik Zainab; and the plaintiff is not the attorney of Nik Afrina: he is the attorney of the late Nik Zainab.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> That this is the legal position as far as exh P1 is concerned, appears to be conceded by the plaintiff in para 14 of the statement of claim. This paragraph states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We wish to pause and state here that we accept the contention of the defendants that with the death of Nik Zainab on 22 June 2007 the Power of Attorney in exh P1 ceased to be in force (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_424;5.;;">s 5 of the Powers of Attorney Act 1949</LINK>). However, it is contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the Power of Attorney continued to be in force notwithstanding the death of Nik Zainab by reason of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_424;6.;;">s 6(a) of the Powers of Attorney Act 1949</LINK> since the Power of Attorney was given for valuable consideration, and that natural love and affection do, in law, constitute valuable consideration, citing <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_745;"><i>Tang Meng Hock v. Tang Ming Seng</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 745</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 33; [2010] 1 CLJ 208 where, at para [20] of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Low Hop Bing JCA said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> With respect, the above dicta is per <i>incurium</i>. In our judgment it is clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;26.;;">s 26(a) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> that 'natural love and affection' does not constitute consideration. Let us examine <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;26.;;">s 26(a)</LINK>. It provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The general rule under our law of contract as provided for by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;26.;;">s 26</LINK> is that an agreement made without consideration is void. But para (a) of the above <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;26.;;">s 26</LINK> provides one of the exceptions to the general rule in a situation where the agreement is made on account of natural love and affection between parties standing in a near relation to each other. Thus para (a) above provides for an exception in a case of natural love and affection; it does not say that natural love and affection constitute consideration. Hashim Yeop Sani J (as he then was) understood that paragraph to be an exception to the general rule when he said in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_620;"><i>Macon Works &amp; Trading Sdn Bhd v. Phang Hon Chin &amp; Anor</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 620</LINK>; [1976] 2 MLJ 177 (at p 627):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Thus, based on exh P1 alone the plaintiff has no <i>locus standi</i> to bring the action on behalf of Nik Afrina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We now move on to exh P2. Earlier in this judgment we have set out the essential provisions of exh P2. According to the plaintiff in his statement of claim (see para 15 of the statement of claim), unlike exh P1, exh P2 creates a trust in relation to the disputed property for the benefit of Nik Afrina, appointing the plaintiff as trustee of the trust. And, apart from that, exh P2 also creates an irrevocable Power of Attorney (for valuable consideration) appointing the plaintiff as the attorney of the late Nik Zainab.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Paragraph 15 of the statement of claim states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We find that this document (exh P2) creates a trust appointing the plaintiff as the trustee in respect of the disputed property and Nik Afrina as the beneficiary. Like exh P1, exh P2 is not just a trust instrument but is also a Power of Attorney in respect of the disputed property. Just like exh P1, the donor of the Power of Attorney is still the late Nik Zainab, and the donee is the plaintiff. But, unlike exh P1, the provisions of the Power of Attorney in exh P2 appear to be extensive.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> For example, cl 10 of exh P2 allows the plaintiff to sell the disputed property (there is no such power in exh P1); and exh P2 gives power to the plaintiff to manage all the deceased's properties including but not limited to institute and defend actions and to recover properties. There is no such power in exh P1; and exh P1 is confined only to the disputed property and does not concern the other properties of the late Nik Zainab.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It is significant to note that exh P2 makes an express reference to exh P1 making it clear that exh P1 shall prevail over exh P2 should there be any contradiction between these two instruments. It is to be recalled that exh P2 states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> If exh P2 is a trust instrument appointing the plaintiff as a trustee for the benefit of Nik Afrina in respect of the disputed property, then, exh P2 contradicts exh P1; since under exh P1 the late Nik Zainab is the trustee for Nik Afrina and not the plaintiff. And since it is provided in exh P2 that in the event that exh P2 contradicts exh P1 the latter (that is, exh P1) prevails, therefore, the provision of exh P1 appointing the late Nik Zainab as the trustee of the trust for Nik Afrina prevails, meaning that exh P2 does not make Nik Rahmat, the plaintiff, the trustee for Nik Afrina. At best exh P2 is merely an irrevocable Power of Attorney appointing the plaintiff as the attorney for the late Nik Zainab. This means that exh P2 does not support the plaintiff 's contention that exh P2 creates a trust instrument appointing the plaintiff as the trustee for the benefit of Nik Afrina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Thus, exh P2 also does not confer any <i>locus standi</i> on the plaintiff to bring this action as 'trustee' or 'attorney' of Nik Afrina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defendants' Counterclaim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The defendants' counterclaim alleges:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It is the defendants' case that the late Nik Zainab, some six months after the execution of exh P1 and exh P2, had directed a solicitor, one Ms San Yuen Ping (DW2), to prepare an irrevocable Power of Attorney (exh D28) appointing her daughter, Nik Rahimi (the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant/3rd defendant), to deal with the disputed property, and to nullify exh P1 and exh P2. Exhibit D28 was executed by the late Nik Zainab in the house of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant/3rd defendant (Nik Rahimi) on 15 December 2006; and it is claimed that the contents of Exh D28 was duly explained to the late Nik Zainab by the said Ms San Yuen Ping.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The late Nik Zainab died some six months later.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The plaintiff contends that, in the light of the state of health of the late Nik Zainab at the material time, exh D28 could not have been voluntarily made by the late Nik Zainab.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The learned trial judge made the following finding:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings On The Counterclaim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In our judgment, based on the evidence, we agree with the finding of the learned trial judge that the defendants had failed to establish fraud in respect of the execution of exh P1 and exh P2 by the late Nik Zainab. However, in the light of the view that we have expressed above that exh P1 and exh P2 are not valid by reason of being confusing and unclear documents and that (assuming the two instruments are valid) the plaintiff has no <i>locus standi</i> to bring this action. The issue of whether or not there was fraud has become somewhat academic.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Based on the evidence, we also accept the finding of the learned trial judge that it had not been satisfactorily established that the late Nik Zainab was mentally fit to execute the Power of Attorney exh D28; and, therefore, the defendants had failed to establish that exh D28 is a valid Power of Attorney.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ruling On The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Under the circumstances we allow the appeal, but only partially, in that we set aside the order of the High Court in allowing the plaintiff 's claim and totally dismissing the defendants' counterclaim. Instead, on our part, we are only allowing prayer (d) of the defendants' counterclaim (a declaration that the disputed property be distributed in accordance with Faraid); and nothing more. (Each party to bear own costs.)</p>
    <p>
      <i>[Appeal allowed in part, ie the disputed property be distributed in accordance with Faraid, the High Court order is set aside, each party to bear own costs.]</i>
