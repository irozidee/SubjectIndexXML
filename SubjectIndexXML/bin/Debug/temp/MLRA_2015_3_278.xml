    <p>The respondent had sustained injuries when a pillion rider on a motorcycle bearing the number plate PHT 7756 tried to snatch her handbag while she was riding her motorcycle on a public road. The motorcycle PHT 7756 was an insured vehicle under an insurance policy taken with the appellant company. The son of the insured person who had taken the policy was the rider of the motorcycle concerned. Both the pillion rider and the son of the insured were caught, convicted and sentenced accordingly for the handbag snatching offence. The respondent then filed a civil claim against both the pillion rider and the son of the insured and a notice was served on the appellant as the insurer of the motorcycle PHT 7756, which the appellant acknowledged receipt. Later when the appellant realised that the insured had breached the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, the appellant repudiated the policy and withdrew its counsel from acting for the pillion rider and the son of the insured. It followed that the respondent obtained a judgment in default against both the pillion rider and the son of the insured and damages in the sum of RM219,112. When no payment was received from the pillion rider and the son of the insured, the respondent sent the sealed copy of the judgment to the appellant. The appellant did not make the payment owing to its stance taken that the insured had breached the insurance policy. The respondent then as plaintiff commenced this recovery action against the appellant as defendant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;90.;;">s 90 Road Transport Act 1987 ('RTA')</LINK>. The Session's Court allowed the respondent's claim, which was affirmed on appeal by the High Court. The appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The right of the respondent as a third party to approach the court for redress against the appellant, which itself was not a tortfeasor and with which the respondent had no contractual relationship, arose from statutory empowerment under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 RTA</LINK>. There was a statutory obligation created by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96</LINK> on the part of the insurer (appellant) on being so notified on the failure of the insured to pay up the judgment sum that the insured had failed to satisfy the third party. That duty to pay up was statutory in origin and was an exception to the concept founded upon privity of contract. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In order for the respondent to succeed in her claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 RTA</LINK>, the requirements in respect of the insurance policy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1) RTA</LINK> must be fulfilled first. Provision <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">(a) of s 91(1)</LINK> was a non-issue. The problem lay with the fulfilment of proviso <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">(b)</LINK> of the same. Under normal circumstances, the respondent as third party would have been able to institute her claim within the confines of the said provision. However, learned counsel for the appellant's grouse had been very specific in that his client (the insurer) ought not to be held responsible to indemnify the respondent because the injuries caused to the respondent had been attributed to the criminal conduct of the insured. Such criminal conduct relating to the use of the motor vehicle that was insured by the appellant was not within the contemplation of the appellant when it had agreed to underwrite the policy to cover the insured's use of the motor vehicle. The appellant's bone of contention was that the criminal act of the insured was not something caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The pertinent words under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b) RTA</LINK> was, "any liability which may be incurred ... in respect of the death of or bodily injury ... caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle". The crucial question was whether the respondent's injuries were caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle by the insured. If they were, the appellant was obliged by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 RTA</LINK> to satisfy the judgment obtained against the insured. It could not be said, with all fairness, that the wordings of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA</LINK> restricted the third party claimant's rights only to any liability wherein the use of the vehicle was one within the contemplation of the insurer. (paras 22-24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Applying the principles in the English cases of <i>Dunthorne v. Bentley And Others, Hardy v. Motor Insurers Bureau and Gardner v. Moore and Another</i>, and adopting the views of the text book author S Santana Dass in <i>"The Law of Motor Insurance"</i>, the phrase in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b) RTA</LINK>, ie "any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle...", would include the liability for damages arising from acts of a criminal nature. The irresistible conclusion would be that the appellant was liable to pay the third party who had suffered injuries as a result of the use of the motor vehicle, which was insured by the appellant regardless of whether it was at the time used for a criminal purpose.(paras 29-36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The injuries suffered by the respondent were caused by or arose out of the insured's use of the motorcycle PHT 7756. The insured's liability to the respondent fell within the ordinary meaning of the words used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b) RTA</LINK>. The expression "use" must be interpreted to mean not only the act of driving the vehicle but also having the use of the vehicle on the road. The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA</LINK> did not restrict the right of the third party to make a claim arising out of the use of the vehicle in commission of a criminal act. Ascribing some other meaning to it to say that it did not cover the use of the vehicle in commission of a criminal act would defeat the very statutory protection accorded to the third party under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">the RTA</LINK> where one of the purposes of enacting the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA</LINK> was to provide protection for third parties against risks arising out of the use of motor vehicle. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> It was the insurer's mandatory duty to satisfy the judgment. The statutory provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) RTA</LINK> were very clear. It imposed upon the insurer (the appellant) the obligation of paying to the person who had obtained a judgment against the insured, after a certificate of insurance had been duly delivered to the person by whom the policy was affected in respect of any third party risk covered under the policy. Therefore, the appellant was obliged statutorily to pay the respondent who had obtained the judgment against the insured. (para 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The appellant as the insurer would only be able to avoid the payment obligation under the circumstances and conditions mentioned in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">subsections (2) and (3) of s 96 RTA</LINK>, ie where the requisite notice of the proceedings was not given to the insurer before the commencement of the proceedings; where there was a stay of the judgment pending appeal; where the policy of insurance respecting the liability had been cancelled; or where the insurer had obtained a declaration from the court that the insurance was void or unenforceable. Based on the facts, none of those conditions were fulfilled by the appellant in the present case to exonerate its statutory obligations under the policy. That being the case, the judgment debt of the insured became the judgment debt of the appellant by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) RTA</LINK>. (paras 39-40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The appellant could not rely on the Exception cl 3(a) of the insurance policy to exclude liability. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">Section 95(k) RTA</LINK> specifically stated that an insurer could not rely on any conditions which purported to restrict the insurance of the persons insured by reference to the matters set out therein <i>inter alia</i> that the motor vehicle was being used for a purpose other than the purpose stated in the policy. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">s 95(k)</LINK>, the insurer could not impose such terms or conditions on the insurance policy contrary to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA</LINK> as was done in this case. (paras 42-43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The use of the motor vehicle under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b) RTA</LINK> would include liability for damages arising from acts of a criminal nature. The appellant was liable to pay the respondent who had suffered injuries as a result of the use of the insured motorcycle PHT 7756 regardless it was at the material time used for a criminal purpose. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">Section 96 RTA</LINK> stated two conditions where no sum would be payable by the insurer and they did not apply to the facts of this case. Further, the exception cl 3(a) of the insurance policy relied on by the appellant as a defence was defeated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">s 95(k) RTA</LINK>.

      <b>Raus Sharif PCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court in affirming the judgment of the Sessions Court in allowing the respondent's recovery action against the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;90.;;">s 90 of the Road Transport Act 1987 (RTA 1987)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard the appeal on 21 August 2014. After hearing the parties, we adjourned the matter for our consideration and decision. We now give our decision and the reasons for the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The background facts of the case is well narrated by the learned High Court Judge, which are as follows. On 19 March 2009, the respondent, Kamacheh Karuppen was riding her motorcycle PHW 117 along a public road from Batu Ferringhi heading towards her house. While riding near Pantai Miami, out of a sudden, someone on another motorcycle PHT 7756 tried to snatch her handbag from behind. She tried to resist and as a result of which she fell off her motorcycle and sustained injuries.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The person who tried to snatch her handbag was a pillion rider on the other motorcycle PHT 7756 that was ridden by the son of the insured. The son of the insured was authorised by the insured to ride the motorcycle no PHT 7756 which was covered by the Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Co Berhad (appellant).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The pillion rider and the son of the insured were charged in the Criminal Court for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;391.;;">s 391 of the Penal Code</LINK>. They were convicted and sentenced accordingly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the same time the respondent filed a civil claim against the pillion rider and the son of the insured in the Georgetown Sessions Court. A notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2) of the RTA 1987</LINK> was served on the appellant as the insurer of motorcycle PHT 7756. The appellant acknowledged receipt of the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Initially, the appellant as the insurer had appointed counsel to represent the pillion rider and the son of the insured in the civil claim. However after realising that the insured had breached the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, the appellant had repudiated the insurance policy vide Notice of Repudiation dated 2 June 2010 (exh D11). The appellant then withdrew its counsel from acting for the pillion rider and the son of the insured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 15 March 2011, the respondent obtained a judgment in default against both the pillion rider and the son of the insured. Damages were assessed by the Sessions Courts in the sum of RM219,112.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As no payment was made either by the pillion rider or the son of the insured, the respondent then sent the sealed copy of the judgment to the appellant. When no payment was forthcoming from the appellant, the respondent commenced with this recovery action against the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;90.;;">s 90 of the RTA 1987</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The recovery claim was for a sum of RM219,112.00 being the sum that was ordered by the Sessions Court to be paid to the respondent by the pillion rider and the son of the insured. It was the respondent's case that the appellant as the admitted insurer was liable to pay to the respondent being the third party that had suffered injuries as a result of the use of motorcycle PHT 7756 on the road which was insured by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Sessions Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> After hearing the evidence from the witnesses called by both parties, the learned Sessions Court Judge found that the appellant was liable to pay the sum RM219,112.00 that was awarded to the respondent. The learned Sessions Court Judge held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Further, the learned Sessions Court Judge held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Aggrieved by the decision of the learned Sessions Court Judge attaching liability against it in respect of payment of the sum that had been assessed by the Sessions Court, the appellant appealed to the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The learned High Court Judge affirmed the decision of the learned Sessions Court Judge. The learned High Court Judge held that the Sessions Judge was correct when he ruled that there is a statutory obligation created by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK> on the part of the appellant being the insurer on being so notified on the failure of the insured to pay up the judgment sum that the insured had failed to satisfy in favour of the respondent. This duty to pay up is statutory in origin and is an exception to the concept founded upon privity of contract. The appellant as the insurer could not have the liberty to exclude this statutory requirement to insure against unlawful or criminal acts or purposes of their insured to escape their statutory obligation to satisfy the judgments of third parties. As the liability is statutory, there cannot be any terms or conditions in the insurance claim that would defeat the very protection granted by the statute on a third party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned High Court Judge was in agreement with the finding of the Sessions Judge in that the word "arising out of the use of the motor vehicle" as appear in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1) of the RTA 1987</LINK> connotes not only the actual driving of the vehicle but also the use of the vehicle on the road. As such the learned High Court Judge was in favour of attaching liability on the appellant being the insurer for the criminal acts of the insured against a third party in the course of the use of the motor vehicle that was insured with the appellant. The learned High Court Judge was of the considered view that there was nothing in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK> that would effectively exempt the insurer from liability to pay a third party who suffers injury on the road as a result of the criminal act of the insured, in relation to the use by him of the insured vehicle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> At the outset we would like to state here that the central issue for determination in this appeal is, ie whether the insurer (appellant) in the instant case ought to be held liable to pay to the third party (respondent) whose injuries had been caused by the criminal use of the vehicle by the insured. Simply put, whether the use of the insured vehicle would cover the use of the same in a criminal act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The right of the respondent as a third party to approach the court for redress against the appellant, who itself is not a tortfeasor and with whom the respondent had no contractual relationship arises from statutory empowerment under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK>. The mechanism of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK> operates thus: there is a statutory obligation created by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK> on the part of the insurer (appellant) on being so notified on the failure of the insured to pay up the judgment sum that the insured had failed to be satisfied in favour of the third party. This duty to pay up is statutory in origin and as said earlier is an exception to the concept founded upon privity of contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In order for the respondent to succeed in her claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK> the requirements in respect of theinsurance policy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1) of the RTA</LINK> must be fulfilled first. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">Section 91(1) of the RTA 1987</LINK> sets down the requirements in respect of policies, where policy of insurance must be a policy which:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Provision <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">(a) of s 91(1)</LINK> is a non-issue here. The problem lies with the fulfilment of proviso <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">(b)</LINK>. Under the normal circumstances the respondent as a third party would have been able to institute her claim within the confines of the said provision. However this is not the situation here as learned counsel for the appellant's grouse had been very specific in that his client (the insurer) ought not to be held responsible to indemnify the respondent because the injuries caused to the respondent had been attributed to the criminal conduct of the insured. Such criminal conduct relating to the use of the motor vehicle that was insured by the appellant was not within the contemplation of the appellant when it had agreed to underwrite the policy to cover the insured's use of the motor vehicle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In short, the appellant's bone of contention is that the criminal act of the insured is not something caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle. Learned counsel referred to the following cases of <i>Herbert v. Railway Passengers Assurance Co</i> [1938] 1 All ER 650, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1972_1_266;"><i>Letchumi &amp; Anor v. The Asia Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1972] 1 MLRA 266</LINK>; [1972] 2 MLJ 105, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_325;"><i>Ramlah Abdullah v. Talasco Insurance Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 325</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 474; [2009] 3 CLJ 620, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1974_1_499;"><i>Ahmad Sandara Lela Putera &amp; Anor v.

Fatimah Binti Abdullah &amp; Ors</i> [1974] 1 MLRA 144</LINK>; [1974] 1 MLJ 156 in support of his proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Learned counsel for the respondent took a diametrically opposed view on this issue in that the policy of insurance issued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91 of the RTA</LINK> covers criminal use of the motor vehicle within the words "arising out of the use of the motor vehicle" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b) of the RTA 1987</LINK>. Learned counsel contended that the statutory provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)</LINK> is clear as it imposes upon the appellant being the insurer the obligation of paying of the person who had obtained a judgment against the insured. Hence, learned counsel submitted that the appellant in this present appeal is obliged to pay the respondent who had obtained judgment against the insured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> After giving our utmost consideration to the issue above, with the greatest of respect we are unable to accede to the contentions urged upon us by learned counsel for the appellant. We are much inclined to agree with the proposition urged upon us by learned counsel for the respondent. Our reasons are thus: The pertinent words under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b)</LINK> would be, "<b>any liability which may be incurred</b> ... in respect of death of or bodily injury ... <b>caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle</b>". [Emphasis Ours]</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The crucial question here is whether the respondent's injuries were "caused by or arising out of' the use of the vehicle by the insured. If they were, the appellant is obliged by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK> to satisfy the judgment obtained against the insured. In this regard as we have said earlier the appellant's grouse here being that the criminal act of the insured is not something caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> With respect we are unable to agree with this proposition. It cannot be said, with all fairness, that the wordings of the Act restricts the third party claimants rights only to any liability wherein the use of the vehicle is one within the contemplation of the insurer. We found support for our views based on the string of English cases which had the occasion to consider the wordings under scrutiny "any liability which may be incurred ... caused by, or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle" which appears under the English Road Transport Act <i>vide</i> s 145 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which is similar to our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1) of RTA 1987</LINK> which is reproduced as follows:</p>

      <b>[25]</b> First in the line of English cases we would like to discuss is the case of <i>Dunthorne v. Bentley And Others</i> [1996] RTR 428 (<i>Dunthorne</i>). What happened in <i>Dunthorne</i> was this: Mrs Bentley the defendant in this particular case was driving her motor vehicle on a road one evening when she ran out of petrol. She parked at the side of the road and stood at the rear of the car. After about 10 minutes she was seen by a colleague who stopped her car on the opposite side of the road. After some shouted conversation Mrs Bentley ran across the road and was struck and fatally injured by an oncoming vehicle driven by the plaintiff, Mr Dunthorne. The plaintiff suffered serious head injuries in the collision and claimed damages against the administrators of Mrs Bentley's estate, who admitted her negligence. On 5 January 1994 judgment was obtained against the administrators of Mrs Bentley's estate. The insurance company was added as a party to the proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The issue before the court was whether the accident arose out of Mrs Bentley's use of her car so that the insurers were liable for the plaintiff 's injuries under the terms of the motor insurance policy issued to Mrs Bentley pursuant to s 145(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The learned trial judge held that the accident arose out of Mrs Bentley's use of her car and, therefore the insurers were liable under Mrs Bentley's insurance policy for the plaintiff's injuries.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The insurers appealed on the grounds <i>inter alia</i> that the learned judge erred in failing to find that the plaintiff 's injuries were neither caused by nor arose out of Mrs Bentley's use of the motor vehicle which she had parked. The insurers also contended that the learned judge erred in failing to give the words "arising out of the use of the vehicle" the natural and ordinary meaning they should bear in the context of Part VI of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Rose LJ in dismissing the insurance company's appeal expressed his conclusion by stating that Mrs Bentley's running across the road was a negligent act which caused the plaintiff 's injuries (as well as her own tragic death); that act was closely and causally connected with her use of the car; and therefore the plaintiff 's injuries arose out of Mrs Bentley's use of the car, within the meaning of s 145(3) of the Act of 1988.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b>
      <i>Hardy v. Motor Insurers Bureau</i> [1964] 2 QB 745 (Hardy) is a case concerning a third party insurance claim against the insurer whereby the third party was injured by the criminal act of the insured use of the vehicle on the road. Lord Denning MR had ruled that such use of the insured vehicle must include cover for injuries caused to a third party by criminal acts committed by the insured. We would like to digress here a little to state that <i>Hardy'</i>s case was deliberated by the Sessions Court Judge as well as the High Court Judge in our instant case. In <i>Hardy'</i>s case the English Court of Appeal had the opportunity to scrutinise s 203(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 then (which is similar to the current s 145(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The facts of <i>Hardy'</i>s case was this: The plaintiff, a security officer at a large metal works, sought to question the driver of a van bearing a stolen road fund licence by stopping the van in the road and asking the driver, who was a worker in the factory, to pull in. While the security officer was holding on to the open van door with his head inside, the driver drove off at a speed, dragging him along the road for some distance and causing bodily injury. The driver was prosecuted accordingly. The plaintiff then sought to recover damages for his injuries, but as the driver was not insured, the plaintiff sought to recover from the defendants, the Motor Insurers' Bureau. The county judge held that the van driver must be presumed to have intended to injure the plaintiff and as such the plaintiff was entitled to the judgment. The Insurance Bureau appealed. In dismissing the appeal the English Court of Appeal held that s 203(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 required a policy of insurance covering liability to a third party arising from even an intentional criminal use of the vehicle on a road.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The public policy consideration in <i>Hardy'</i>s case <i>(supra)</i> had recognised that the insured himself cannot benefit from compensation for injuries that may be sustained by him via his criminal conduct, but by some token, public policy would expect that an innocent third party must be protected by the insurance cover of the insured in such circumstances. In this regard we would like to cite a passage by Lord Denning MR in <i>Hardy'</i>s case which seems to us to summarise admirably the reasoning under scrutiny in the present appeal. Lord Denning MR held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In <i>Gardner v. Moore and Another</i> [1984] 2 WLR 714 (Gardner) , the plaintiff suffered injuries as a result of being run down by a motor vehicle driven by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The injuries sustained by the plaintiff were caused by the intentional criminal act of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who deliberately drove his vehicle on to the pavement where the plaintiff was walking and intentionally ran him down. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant pleaded guilty to a criminal charge under s 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 of wounding the plaintiff with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm, and was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment for three years. At the time of the accident the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had not been insured by any relevant policy of insurance under Part VI of the Road Traffic Act 1972.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The plaintiff issued a writ against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for damages for personal injuries and joined the Motor Insurers Bureau (Bureau) as 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, claiming that by virtue of an agreement dated 22 November 1972 between the Bureau and the Secretary of State for the Environment (MIB agreement) the Bureau was bound to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of any judgment that the plaintiff obtained against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. At the trial of the action the plaintiff was awarded damages against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and a declaration that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant (Bureau) is liable to indemnify the plaintiff for the judgment against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant appealed to the House of Lords.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The House of Lords dismissed the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant's appeal. Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone, LC quoted at length the reasoning postulated by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Hardy'</i>s case. The House of Lords in Gardner held that the judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had been a judgment payable in respect of a liability incurred by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant for damages for personal injury "caused by, or arising out of, the use of' the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's motor car within s 145(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1972, despite the fact that the use had been a criminal use.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Eminent text book authors have also lent credence to the above proposition. Learned counsel for the respondent had highlighted to us an excerpt from the book titled <i>"The Law of Motor Insurance"</i> by S Santana Dass. The eminent author on the related issue before this court had opined at p 230 of his book that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Applying the principles in the English cases discussed above and adopting the views of the text book author cited above we would conclude by saying that the phrase in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b) of the RTA</LINK>, "... any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle ...", would include the liability for damages arising from acts of a criminal nature. The irresistible conclusion would be that the appellant is liable to pay the third party who had suffered injuries as a result of the use of the motor vehicle which is insured by the appellant regardless whether it was at the time used for a criminal purpose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The injuries suffered by the respondent in the instant case were caused by or arose out of the insured's use of his motorcycle. The insured's liability to the respondent falls within the ordinary meaning of the words used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b)</LINK>. The expression "use" must be interpreted to mean not only the act driving of the vehicle but also having the use of the vehicle on the road. It cannot be said, with all fairness, that the Act restricts the right of the third party to make a claim arising out of the use of the vehicle in commission of a criminal act. Ascribing some other meaning to it to say that this does not cover the use of the vehicle in commission of a criminal act will defeat the very statutory protection accorded to the third party <i>vide</i> the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK> where one of the purposes of enacting the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK> was to make provision for protecting third party against risks arising out of the use of motor vehicle. The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK> long title reads "An Act to ... make provision for the protection of third parties against risks arising out of the use of motor vehicles".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Perhaps it would be opportune for us to also highlight here that it is the insurer's mandatory duty to satisfy the judgment. The statutory provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1)</LINK> is very clear. It imposes upon the insurer (the appellant, in this appeal) the obligation of paying to the person who had obtained a judgment against the insured, after a certificate of insurance had been duly delivered to the person by whom the policy is affected in respect of any third party risk covered under the policy. In short, the appellant in the present appeal is obliged statutorily to pay the respondent who had obtained the judgment dated 15 March 2011 against the insured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The appellant as the insurer would only be able to avoid the payment obligation under the circumstances and conditions mentioned in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">subsections (2) and (3) of s 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK>, that is to say, where the requisite notice of the proceedings was not given to the insurer before the commencement of the proceedings; where there is a stay of the judgment pending appeal; where the policy of insurance respecting the liability had been cancelled; and where the insurer had obtained a declaration from the court that the insurance was void or unenforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Based on the facts, none of these conditions were fulfilled by the appellant (insurer) in the present case to exonerate its statutory obligations under the policy. That being the case, the judgment debt of the insured becomes judgment debt of the appellant (insurer) by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) of the RTA 1987</LINK> (see case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_263;"><i>Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Co Bhd v. Muniammah Muniandy</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 263</LINK>; [2011] 1 CLJ 947). Similar sentiments were expressed by the learned Sessions Court judge as upheld by the High Court Judge which we are in agreement with. The learned High Court Judge had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Another point which merits our consideration is whether Exception 3(a) can be relied upon by the appellant to prevent the respondent from enforcing the judgment. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;94.;;">Sections 94</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">95 of the RTA 1987</LINK> prohibit an insurer from relying on certain terms in an insurance policy for the purposes of excluding liability. On the other hand a term or condition which does not come within the purview of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;94.;;">ss 94</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">95</LINK> may be legitimately relied upon by the insurer for the purposes of excluding liability under the policy when a claim is brought by a third party. The question now is whether Exception 3(a) can be legitimately relied upon by the appellant to exclude liability. The answer to this question lies in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">s 95(k) of the RTA 1987</LINK> itself. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">Section 95(k) of the RTA 1987</LINK> reads thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> It is noteworthy to mention here that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">s 95(k) of the RTA 1987</LINK> specifically states that an insurer cannot rely on any conditions which purport to restrict the insurance of the persons insured by reference to the matters set out therein inter alia that the motor vehicle was being used for a purpose other than the purpose stated in the policy. (see Santana Dass on <i>"The Law of Motor Insurance"</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> S Santana Dass in his book <i>"The Law of Motor Insurance"</i> analysed <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">s 95(k) of the RTA 1987</LINK> to mean:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We are in agreement with the views expressed by the learned author that by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">s 95(k) of the RTA 1987</LINK>, the insurer cannot impose such terms or condition on their insurance policy that would be contrary to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK> as was done in this case following the General Exceptions 3(a) of the insurance policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the final analysis, what is left for us to consider is whether appellate intervention is warranted in the instant case. In this regard it is our considered view the learned Sessions Court Judge and the learned High Court Judge had dealt with the very essence of the appellant's main grievance, namely that the insurance company ought to be held liable to pay the third party whose injuries had been caused by the criminal use of the insured vehicle on the road by the insured. The learned Sessions Judge and the High Court Judge had addressed their mind to the various provisions in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK> which provisions had been correctly interpreted. We find there is no appealable error which warrants appellate intervention on accepted principles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> To sum up, based on the statutory requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">ss 96</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">91(1) of RTA 1987</LINK> and premised on the persuasive reasoning given by the English Courts in the cases we have cited in the preceding paragraphs, it would be mandatory for the insurer to pay the respondent following the judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We are of the considered view that the phrase in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(1)(b) of the RTA 1987</LINK>, "... any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle ..." would include the liability for damages arising from acts of a criminal nature. Therefore the appellant is liable to pay the respondent who had suffered injuries as a result of the use of the motor vehicle which was insured by the appellant regardless it was at the time used for a criminal purpose. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">Section 96 of the RTA 1987</LINK> clearly states the only two conditions where no sum would be payable by the insurer and they do not apply to the facts of this case. Further, Exception 3(a) relied on by the appellant as a defence is defeated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;95.;;">s 95(k) of the RTA 1987</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> For the above said reasons, we dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
