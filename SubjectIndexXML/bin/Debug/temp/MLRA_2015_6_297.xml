    <p>The respondent (a co-operative society) vide a third party memorandum of deposit ('MOD') agreed to deposit RM25 million with the appellant bank as security for a loan granted by the appellant to a private company known as Estate and Forestry Consulting Management Sdn Bhd ('EFCM') for the purpose of financing the development of an oil palm plantation project on the respondent's lands. The MOD stipulated that the deposit was not to be withdrawn until the appellant exhausted all means of action against EFCM and other security providers involved. The loan was duly disbursed after the execution of an agreement between the respondent and EFCM. However, the respondent only deposited RM13 million out of the agreed RM25 million under the MOD leaving a shortfall of RM12 million. EFCM subsequently defaulted on the loan repayments and the appellant obtained a judgment in default against the said company. Instead of proceeding to execute the judgment, the appellant withdrew the deposit under the MOD to reduce the debt due and owing under the loan. The respondent then brought an action against the appellant to declare the MOD invalid, claiming that the appellant prematurely withdrew the deposit before exhausting all means of action against EFCM. The appellant at once counterclaimed for the shortfall amount pledged under the MOD. The High Court in favour of the respondent relied on two Supreme Court decisions, namely, <i>Malaysia Shipyard and Engineering Sdn Bhd v. Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia Bhd</i> ('<i>Malaysian Shipyard</i>') and <i>Chase Manhattan Bank NA v. Mercantile Co-Operative Thrift and Loan Society Ltd</i> ('<i>Chase Manhattan</i>') in coming to its findings that the MOD was invalid, void and unenforceable. The High Court also dismissed the appellant's counterclaim. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal which affirmed the findings of the High Court. Hence, the appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal and counterclaim):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The findings of the Supreme Court in <i>Malaysian Shipyard</i> and <i>Chase Manhattan</i> were based on the interpretation of the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">Co-operative Societies Act 1948 ('the 1948 Act')</LINK>. The 1948 Act was wholly repealed and replaced by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">Co-operative Societies Act 1993 ('the 1993 Act')</LINK>, which came into force in February 1993. All the relevant transactions in the present case, in particular the issuing of the MOD, took place between 2001 and 2002 when <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> was fully in force. The relevant laws for consideration for the purpose of this appeal would clearly be <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>. Therefore, the decisions of the Supreme Court in the said cases which interpreted different sets of laws wholly repealed, could not be applied herein, save for the general provisions. The facts and the laws could clearly be distinguished. Under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>, the "by-laws" of a co-operative society had become an important element in determining the validity of other transactions between the co-operative and a non-member. (paras 40- 51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Following the general principle of law adopted by the Supreme Court in <i>Malaysian Shipyard</i> and <i>Chase Manhattan</i>, a corporation created by statute for particular purposes could only make such contracts as it was expressly or by necessary implication empowered to make by the statute creating it; and contracts purporting to be made by statutory corporations which were outside the powers conferred by statute were <i>ultra vires</i> and void <i>ab initio</i>. The relevant by-laws of the respondent must also be considered. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the respondent's by-laws were relevant and applicable to determine the issue under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK> that dealt with restriction on other transactions with non-members. (paras 52-53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The respondent was the main actor or the main participant in the whole series of related transactions that had taken place between the parties concerned. The loan was granted for the sole purpose of financing the development of the respondent's lands. The oil palm project was a turnkey project whereby after its completion, and the lands developed and planted with oil palm, they would be delivered to the respondent. The respondent would benefit from the prospective revenue derived from the sale of the raw oil palm fruits. As such, the respondent was not a total stranger or an independent third party having no relation to the loan granted to EFCM. The respondent clearly had an interest in the loan granted. Without the loan, the agreement between the respondent and EFCM could not be effected and the project not carried out. (paras 58-62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The respondent did not dispute the validity of the MOD at all material times. The respondent's General Manager in fact handed a copy of the respondent's by-laws to the appellant to convince the appellant that the respondent had the authority to provide the MOD in favour of the appellant. The respondent only sought to dispute the validity of the MOD after the appellant uplifted the deposit. The by-laws of a co-operative society were generally rules of conduct governing its internal management. However, by-laws of a co-operative society now were given the force of law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. There were limitations to the scope of "transaction" allowable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53</LINK>. The object or purpose of incorporation of a registered co-operative society was an important element to be considered in determining whether a 'transaction' was within <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. The object or purpose of the respondent herein could be found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;4.;;">s 4 of the 1993 Act</LINK> and paras 4 and 5 of its by-laws. The issuing of the MOD by the respondent in favour of the appellant was part of the transactions to carry out the respondent's object or intention to own and develop oil palm plantation. (paras 63-80)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The Court of Appeal erred in applying the Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act 2007 which came into force on January 2008, in view of the fact that the MOD was transacted in 2002. The Court of Appeal also erred in relying on the terms "credit facility" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51(1)</LINK> and its definition under s 2 of the 2007 amendment, which was not in force then. At the material time, the words were not defined in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>. Without an express definition in the relevant statute governing the transaction in question, a 'guarantee' could not be said to be a "credit facility" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">ss 51</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;52.;;">52 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. The 2007 amendment too did not have a retrospective effect and as such was not applicable to the present case. The issues had to be resolved according to the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> prevailing at the time when the related transactions took place. (paras 83-91)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The MOD issued by the respondent was a continuing security, pledge or lien for the due payment to the appellant by the borrower on demand of all monies due to the appellant during the loan facility period. Under cl 2 of the MOD, the respondent <i>inter alia</i> agreed and undertook to continue to maintain the said deposit with the appellant or at such places as the appellant might from time to time direct during the period of the continuing security. (para 95)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The appellant did not exhaust all actions against EFCM before exercising its right to withdraw or uplift the fixed deposit as clearly required under the MOD and the loan facility agreement. The appellant did not take any execution proceedings against EFCM to enforce the judgment in default it obtained against EFCM but instead proceeded to uplift the fixed deposit. The unilateral uplifting of the fixed deposit amounted to a clear violation of cl 4 of the MOD and cl 13.1 of the loan facility agreement. The uplifting was premature and contractually invalid. The High Court and the Court of Appeal were correct in coming to their decision that the appellant's act amounted to a breach of contract. (para 99)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The MOD was valid and enforceable and not <i>ultra vires</i> the relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>. As a continuing security, pledge or lien for the due payment to the appellant during the loan facility period, the MOD bound the appellant and the respondent and could be enforced by them respectively. The appellant in prematurely uplifting the entire fixed deposit in violation of cl 4 of the MOD did not render the MOD void <i>ab initio</i>. Any loss to the respondent could be compensated by damages and the respondent placed in the same position as if the breach did not occur. The court order directing the return of the fixed deposit under the MOD to the respondent was clearly against the settled principle that the respondent should not be put in a better position than it would have been if the breach had not occurred, particularly so when the loan was disbursed based on the certifications of works done by the respondent, and the project was 63.4% completed. The order should have been for the re-instatement of the fixed deposit with accrued interest subject to the terms of the MOD. (paras 100-102)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The appellant's counterclaim should not have been dismissed since the MOD was valid and enforceable. The respondent was supposed to deposit the total agreed amount of RM25 million but failed to do so despite various reminders sent by the appellant. By depositing RM13 million with a shortfall of RM12 million, the appellant contractually committed a breach of its own MOD agreed between the parties concerned. Any dispute as to the physical implementation of the project must be dealt with between the respondent and EFCM as the contractor of the project based on the agreement between them. The issue of non-completion of the project was not the concern of the appellant. The appellant fulfilled its obligation to provide and disburse the loan as certified by the respondent in accordance with the loan facility agreement and MOD. The appellant's premature uplifting of the deposit should not be a ground for the respondent to refuse or neglect to fulfill its obligation to make payment for the shortfall. (paras 112-114)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ramly Ali FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The respondent in the present appeal, Koperasi Permodalan Melayu Negeri Johor was the plaintiff while the appellant, Bank Pertanian Malaysia Berhad was the defendant in the suit at the High Court. For ease of reference, the respondent herein shall be referred to as the "the Koperasi" and the appellant as "the bank".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The Koperasi, at all material times, is a body corporate or co-operative society registered under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">Co-operative Societies Act 1993 (the 1993 Act)</LINK> (which as provided for under cl 4 of its by-laws) has as its object the promotion of economic interest of its members in accordance with co-operative principles. It was first registered on 3 March 1966 (under the earlier 1948 Act which was replaced by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>). Its main objective involves the development of land in various sectors including agricultural and commercial development.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The bank, is a body corporate duly incorporated pursuant to the Bank Pertanian Malaysia Act 1969 (which was wholly repealed and substituted by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2008_684;;">Bank Pertanian Malaysia Berhad Act 2008 (the 2008 Act)</LINK>. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2008_684;4.;;">s 4(1) of the 2008 Act</LINK>, all properties, rights and liabilities of the former Bank Pertanian Malaysia were transferred to and vested in the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The present appeal before us is against the decision of the High Court (which was later affirmed by the Court of Appeal) which allowed the claim by the Koperasi for <i>inter alia</i> a declaration that a third party Memorandum Bank of deposit dated 22 March 2002 for the sum of RM25 million (the MOD) given by the Koperasi in favour of the bank is invalid and unenforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Factual Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Sometime in 2000-2001, there were two pieces of undeveloped land known as Lot PT4888, Mukim Ulu Nenggiri, Daerah Bertam; and Lot 3647, Mukim Relai, Daerah Chiku both in Gua Musang, Kelantan. The combined size of both lands were 10,291.40 acres. Both lands were owned by Yayasan Kelantan Darulnaim (YAKIN) but were leased to a private company known as Terokai Pertiwi Sdn Bhd (TPSB) for a term of 66 years. They were both classified as agricultural lands for the purpose of oil palm plantations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In line with its main objective to develop land in various sectors including agricultural and commercial development, the Koperasi had on 26 February 2001 taken over the whole equity of TPSB for a sum of RM12.5 million. Since that date TPSB became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Koperasi. In other words, the lands in question were effectively leased by the Koperasi through a wholly owned subsidiary, TPSB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In order to develop the lands as oil palm plantations, the Koperasi engaged another private company known as Estate and Forestry Consulting Management Sdn Bhd (EFCM). EFCM was incorporated as a private limited company under the Companies Act 1965 on 14 July 1995, which at the material time was carrying on, <i>inter alia</i>, the business of consultation, development and plantation of oil palm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 12 November 2001, the Koperasi and EFCM entered into an agreement known as the Oil Palm Plantation and Development Agreement (Plantation and Development Agreement) whereby the Koperasi appointed EFCM to develop oil palm plantations on the said lands, based on the representation made by EFCM that it had the requisite technology, expertise, experience and financial resources to undertake the development and planting of oil palm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Some of the salient terms of the Plantation and Development Agreement which may be relevant to the present appeal before us are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> After the execution of the Plantation and Development Agreement between the Koperasi and EFCM, the bank, vide a Letter of Offer dated 6 December 2001 and a Facility Agreement dated 22 March 2002 granted a term loan facility of RM25 million to EFCM (as the borrower) for the purpose of financing the said project development.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Paragraph 2 of the Letter of Offer dated 6 December 2001 issued by the bank states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The Facility Agreement (between the bank and EFCM dated 22 March 2002) clearly made reference to the said project development in the Plantation and Development Agreement dated 12 November 2001. The same recital also made reference to the request for the loan made by EFCM and the bank's Letter of Offer dated 6 December 2001 which clearly indicated that the purpose of the loan facility was for the development of 10,291.49 acres of land into oil palm plantations on 'turnkey basis' in Gua Musang, Kelantan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Clause 1.3 of the Facility Agreement provides for securities for the loan, to be provided to the satisfaction of the bank:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The Facility Agreement was duly executed on 22 March 2002 by EFCM and the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The Koperasi, in fulfilling the abovementioned security requirement executed the MOD dated 22 March 2002 in favour of the bank. Paragraph 1.1 of the MOD, states that the Koperasi "hereby deposit with the bank the Investment Account Certificate ... made out in the bank's favour for a total sum of Ringgit Malaysia Twenty Five Million (RM25,000,000.00 only) which shall be held by the bank as a continuing security pledge or lien for the due payment to the bank by the borrower (EFCM) on demand of all monies due to the bank during the facility period." It is also stated in the same paragraph that the deposit of the MOD was made in consideration of the bank "at our consent, granting or continuing to grant a facility up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of Ringgit Malaysia Twenty Five Million (RM25,000.000.00) only to ESTATE &amp; FORESTRY CONSULTING MANAGEMENT SDN BHD ... upon the terms and subject to the conditions stipulated in the Facility Agreement ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> One pertinent point to the issue in the Koperasi's claims in the present case is found in para 4 of the MOD, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The project development proceeded after the execution of all the relevant documentations. Between 28 March 2002 and 10 May 2004, the Koperasi (using its own letterhead, signed by its Director/Planting Advisor Hj Dzulkefli bin Hj Nasir and Pengurus Besar Hj Ariff Kassim) issued various Certificates of Practical Completion to the bank for the purpose of disbursement of the loan. Accordingly, the bank had progressively disbursed loan to EFCM as the developer of the project. As at 1 June 2003, the Koperasi however had only deposited and pledged the sum of RM13 million with the bank under the MOD leaving a shortfall of RM12 million. Thereafter, the Koperasi failed to deposit the shortfall despite the reminders by the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In the meantime, EFCM defaulted in repayment of the loan. On 5 March 2007 the bank commenced legal proceedings against EFCM for recovery of the loan. On 22 June 2007, the bank obtained judgment in default against EFCM.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On 6 December 2007, the bank uplifted the deposit pledged by the Koperasi under the MOD, and utilised it to reduce the debt due and owing under the loan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On 31 December 2007, the Koperasi, through its solicitors, for the first time, disputed the validity of the MOD dated 22 March 2007 issued in favour of the bank. The Koperasi claimed that the MOD was "an invalid instrument" and demanded that the amount deposited under the MOD (together with interest accrued) be returned to it within seven days from the date of the letter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On 2 April 2008, the Koperasi commenced the present claim in the High Court against the bank for <i>inter alia</i> a declaration that the MOD in question was <i>ultra vires</i> and void <i>ab initio</i>, and sought the return of the fixed deposits uplifted by the bank. The bank counterclaimed for the sum of RM12 million, being the shortfall due from the Koperasi pursuant to the MOD.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> At the date when the Koperasi commenced the present claim in the High Court, the bank had disbursed the sum of RM23,935.000.00 to EFCM under the Facility Agreement for the purpose of the project development in question. This is based on the evidence adduced by the bank. Even based on the progressive certificates issued by the Koperasi, the value of work done in the project (as certified by the Koperasi) was RM20,188,336.65. On the evidence adduced during trial, EFCM had abandoned the work. There were no evidence to show that the Koperasi had paid EFCM the sum due to EFCM under the Plantation and Development Agreement or any part of it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The project development had been substantially completed at the time the action was filed in the High Court. This is evidenced by the various reports namely the "Laporan Progress Kerja dan Penyata Perbelanjaan Kontrak Turnkey" as well as in the certification in the "Confirmation and Certification of Sums Expended To Date Being Part Development Expenditure Under Turnkey Project For the Development of Oil Palm Plantation of Teroka Pertiwi Sdn Bhd (A wholly subsidiary of KPMNJ) in Gua Musang" issued by the Koperasi from time to time during the project period (see: Tabs 12, 13, 14 &amp; 18 of the Common Core Bundle 3).</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> After full trial, the learned Judicial Commissioner allowed the Koperasi's claim and dismissed the bank's counterclaim. In dealing with the matter before him, the learned Judicial Commissioner identified two issues to be determined, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On the first issue (the validity of the MOD), the learned Judicial Commissioner held that the MOD was <i>
ultra vires</i> the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> and invalid on the ground that the 1993 Act contains no power to authorise the Koperasi to issue guarantee by way of an MOD in favour of the bank. In coming to that finding the learned Judicial Commissioner relied strongly on the decisions of the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_114;"><i>Malaysia Shipyard &amp; Engineering Sdn Bhd v. Bank Kerjasama Rakyat (M) Bhd</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 114</LINK>; [1985] CLJ Rep 206 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_362;"><i>Chase Manhattan Bank, NA v. The Mercantile Co-Operative Thrift &amp; Loan Society Ltd</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 362</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 168; [1992] 1 CLJ 35.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In his Grounds of Judgment (at para 27) the learned Judicial Commissioner held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Further (at para 30 of the Grounds of Judgment) the learned Judicial Commissioner continued:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> On the second issue, the learned Judicial Commissioner, held that the bank had breached the terms of the MOD by uplifting the fixed deposits pledged, before it exhausted all legal actions against EFCM and other security providers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Abiding by the decision of the High Court, the bank returned the fixed deposits uplifted together with interest on them (which in total came to the sum of RM18,035,057.35) to the Koperasi on 30 November 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The Court of Appeal agreed with and affirmed the decision of the High Court and dismissed the bank's appeal with costs of RM50,000.00. In coming to its decision, the Court of Appeal "respectfully adopts the trite principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> that a Statutory Corporation can only do what is expressly authorised by the Act under which it is incorporated."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The Court of Appeal agreed with and accepted the submission of learned counsel for the Koperasi that the issue of the validity of the MOD must be determined by reference to the provisions in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> and not by reference to the Koperasi's by-laws since by-laws are rules of conduct which govern the internal government of the Koperasi.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The Court of Appeal rejected submissions by learned counsel for the bank that the Koperasi was allowed by its by-laws (in particular by-law 5(g)) to grant the MOD in favour of the bank. In doing so, the Court of Appeal stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> On this issue, the Court of Appeal concluded that "the MOD is invalid and unenforceable as it was issued in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51(1) of the Act</LINK>."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> What is interesting to observe here is that, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, we find that the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, in essence, is the same as that of the High Court, save for one material difference, ie in arriving at its decision, the Court of Appeal apparently applied <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> as amended by the Co-Operative Societies (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act A1297) which only came into force on 1 January 2008 (the 2007 Amendment); while the relevant transaction, particularly the granting of the MOD in favour of the bank by the Koperasi, took place on 22 March 2002.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> On the issue of breach of contract, the Court of Appeal, surprisingly after finding out that the contract document, ie the MOD was invalid and unenforceable, agreed with the High Court that "the learned JC is correct in his finding that the appellant's act was premature and amounted to a breach of contract."</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Leave to appeal to the Federal Court was granted on 20 January 2014 on the following questions, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Bank's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In essence, the submissions by learned counsel for the bank can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Koperasi's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Submissions by learned counsel for the Koperasi can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In determining the validity of the MOD issued by the Koperasi in favour of the bank, we have to first determine the applicable law to the facts of the present case. This is because the High Court had strongly relied on the two Supreme Court decisions in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i>and <i>Chase Manhattan (supra)</i> in coming to its findings that the MOD in the present case was invalid, void and unenforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> It must be noted that the findings of the Supreme Court in <i>Malaysian Shipyard (supra)</i> and <i>Chase Mahathan (supra)</i>were based on the interpretation of the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">Co-operative Societies Act 1948 (Act 287) (the 1948 Act)</LINK>, which was first enacted in 1948 as the FM Ordinance No 33 of 1948 and later revised and came into force on 18 August 1983. <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">This 1948 Act</LINK> was wholly repealed and replaced by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> which came into force in February 1993).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i>, the respondent, a cooperative society registered under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">the 1948 Act</LINK>, issued a guarantee whereby it agreed to indemnify the appellant therein, up to a sum of RM500,000.00 in the event of a certain company called Syarikat Pembinaan Azlin Sdn Bhd (Azlin Sdn Bhd) failed to perform its contract with the appellant which was signed by the parties on 29 September 1975. Azlin Sdn Bhd failed to perform the contract, whereupon the appellant terminated the said contract and thereafter sued the respondent upon the guarantee. The said guarantee was given to a non-member for the benefit of another non-member. From the judgment, there was no indication as to the nature of the contract between Azlin Sdn Bhd and the appellant therein. There was also no evidence to show as to whose benefit the contract was for, and whether such transaction is conducive or otherwise to the economic well-being of members. The majority decision in that case (comprising Salleh Abas LP, Abdul Hamid Omar CJM and Eusoffe Abdoolcader SCJ) ruled that applying the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK>, the said guarantee was <i>ultra vires</i> and void <i>ab initio</i>; while the dissenting decision (comprising Wan Suleiman SCJ and George Seah SCJ) ruled that the said guarantee was <i>intra vires</i> and was therefore lawful and valid. As aptly expressed by George Seah SCJ; "There is apparently no dispute as to the general principle applicable but we seem to differ on the interpretation of the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the Act</LINK>."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The Supreme Court considered the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;30.;;">ss 30</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;31.;;">31</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">32 of the 1948 Act</LINK>. For ease of reference, these sections are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The Supreme Court in interpreting the relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">the 1948 Act</LINK> adopted an earlier principle as laid down by the House of Lords in <i>Small v. Smith</i> [1884-85] 10 AC 119, 138 which was succinctly stated in <i>Halsbury's Law of England</i>, 4th edn, para 1333, at p 779 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The majority decision of the Supreme Court in that case ruled:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The majority decision ruled that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;30.;;">s 30 of the 1948 Act</LINK> deals specifically with loans given by a cooperative society to those parties listed therein, while <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;31.;;">s 31</LINK> deals with borrowings by a co-operative society by receiving deposits and loans from persons who are not members as prescribed by its by-laws. These two sections may not be directly applicable in the determination of the issue before the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The majority decision in that case was later adopted and followed in another case, <i>Chase Manhattan (supra)</i> which interpreted the same provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK> in relation to the same issue of giving of guarantee by a co-operative society in favour of a third party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> It must be noted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK>, which formed the basis of the Supreme Court decision in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> provides for "... such prohibitions and restrictions as may be prescribed by the rules". As provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;2.;;">s 2 of the 1948 Act</LINK>; "rules" means rules made under the Act, ie made by the Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51 of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">Section 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK> did not make any reference to by-laws of a co-operative society. Therefore, the Supreme Court had rightly referred to only the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder in determining the validity of the guarantee without referring to any by-laws. This was clearly stated by Salleh Abas LP at p 114 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> As rightly found by the Supreme Court neither the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">the 1948 Act</LINK> nor the rules made thereunder, expressly empowers the co-operative society to issue guarantee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> As stated earlier, the whole of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">the 1948 Act</LINK> was subsequently repealed and replaced by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> which came into force in February 1993. The matters earlier covered by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;30.;;">ss 30</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;31.;;">31</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">32 of the 1948 Act</LINK> were then provided for in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">ss 51</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;52.;;">52</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. In the instant case before us, all the relevant transactions particularly the issuing of the MOD by the Koperasi in favour of the bank, took place in 2001-2002, the period when <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> was fully in force. Therefore the relevant laws for consideration for the purpose of this appeal is obviously <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> For ease of comparison <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">ss 51</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;52.;;">52</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">53 of the 1993 Act</LINK> are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> One material difference between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK> which dealt with the same issue of "Restriction on other transactions with non-members" is that the words "the rules" in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">the 1948 Act</LINK> had been substituted with the words "its by-laws" in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>, which are defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;2.;;">s 2</LINK> there of to mean the registered by-laws made by a registered society in the exercise of any power conferred by the Act, and includes a registered amendment of the by-laws. The legal effect of this difference is that other transactions between a co-operative society and non-members are now governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK> and these transactions are no longer governed by "the rules" prescribed by the Minister but by "the by-laws" of the co-operative society concerned. Therefore, the decisions of the Supreme Court in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> and <i>Chase Manhattan (supra)</i> which interpreted different set of laws that has already been wholly repealed could not be applied, save/or the general pupils, in dealing with the instant case before us. The facts and the laws can clearly be distinguished. Under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>, the "by-laws" of a co-operative society have become an important element in determining the validity of "other transactions between the cooperative and non-member."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> For the purpose of the instant case, we can still adopt and follow the general principle of law as adopted by the Supreme Court in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> and <i>Chase Manhattan (supra)</i>that "a corporation created by statute for particular purposes can only make such contracts as it is expressly or by necessary implication empowered to make by the statute creating it; and contracts purporting to be made by statutory corporations which are outside the powers conferred by statute are <i>ultra vires</i> and void <i>ab initio</i>." However, the relevant "by-laws" of the Koperasi must also be considered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Koperasi's by-laws are relevant and applicable to determine the issue under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. Paragraph 4 provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Paragraph 5(c), (e), (f) and (g) provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Paragraph 4 of the by-laws and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;4.;;">s 4(1) of the 1993 Act</LINK> clearly provide that the object and purposes of the Koperasi is for the promotion of the economic interest of its members in accordance with co-operative principles "dengan menggalakkan penamaan modal untuk menjalankan perniagaan dan pelaburan yang boleh menguntungkan."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The terms "co-operative principles" as defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;2.;;">s 2 of the 1993 Act</LINK> includes:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> A co-operative society once duly registered under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> shall become a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal, and with power to hold movable and immovable property of every description, to enter into contracts, to institute and defend suit and other legal proceedings and to do all things necessary for the purposes for which it is constituted (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;9.;;">s 9</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In the present case, the evidence adduced show that the Koperasi was not a mere independent third party who gave guarantee to a loan facility granted by the bank to a total stranger. The evidence show that the Koperasi was the main 'actor' or the main participant in the whole series of related transactions right from beginning; when on 26 February 2001, it acquired 100% equity of Terokai Pertiwi Sdn Bhd (TPSB) which at that time held 66 years' lease of the two lands in Gua Musang classified as agricultural lands for the purpose of oil palm plantations. The Koperasi intended to develop the lands into oil palm plantations; engaged EFCM as a consultant and contractor to carry out the project development; assisted EFCM to obtain loan facility from the bank and subsequently provided the MOD for a value of RM25 million for the same purpose in favour of the bank. In fact after the project proceeded and loan disbursed by the bank, it was the Koperasi who that issued the progress certifications for job completion for the purpose of progressive disbursement of the loan for the project. Under the MOD, the Koperasi promised to provide a security deposit of RM25 million, however only RM13 million was provided, leaving a balance of RM12 million. The contractor, EFCM, failed its repayment as scheduled in the Facility Agreement and the Koperasi also failed to top-up the balance of the security deposit under the MOD.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> As clearly stated in para 2 of the Letter of Offer dated 6 December 2001 issued by the bank, the loan was granted for the sole purpose of financing the development of the lands owned by the Koperasi (through its wholly owned subsidiary, TPSB). In the project agreement with EFCM, the Koperasi has agreed to deliver and deposit with the bank a sum of RM25 million by way of security deposit for the loan (s 2.01(2) of the Agreement). According to DW2, the Section Head of Portfolio Management &amp; Control, Credit Risk Management Department of the bank, in his evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Further in his evidence, DW2 said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> The project development for the oil palm plantations to be carried out by EFCM was a turnkey project whereby after the project completed and the lands have been developed and planted with oil palm, it would be delivered to the Koperasi, through its wholly owned subsidiary, TPSB. The prospective revenue for the Koperasi for the sale of raw oil palm fruits was estimated to be RM140.00 per metric ton at that time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> With this background, the Koperasi was not a total stranger or an independent third party that has no relation at all to the loan granted to EFCM. The Koperasi, clearly has an interest in the loan granted to EFCM because as testified by DW2, without the loan from the bank, the Development and Plantation Agreement could not be affected and the oil palm project could not be carried out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> At all material times, the Koperasi did not dispute the validity of the MOD provided by them to the bank. In fact, a copy of the Koperasi's by-laws was handed over to the bank (through DW2) by one Encik Abu Samah, the General Manager of the Koperasi at that time, to convince the bank that the Koperasi has the authority to provide the MOD in favour of the bank. The Koperasi only sought to dispute the validity of the MOD for the first time by a letter dated 31 December 2007 after the deposit was uplifted by the bank. In that letter the Koperasi claimed that the MOD was invalid and demanded the bank to return the amount deposited together with interest and profits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Generally, by-laws of a co-operative society, made by the society itself, are merely rules of conduct governing its internal management. This view was expressed by the Supreme Court in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> and followed by the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the instant case. However, by-laws of a co-operative society have been given the force of law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. That being the case, in view of the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>, non-members (including the bank) are entitled to rely on the Koperasi's by-laws as they relate to "other transactions" with them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> The word "by-laws" has been incorporated under the present <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;2.;;">s 2 the 1993 Act</LINK>, "by-laws" refer to "the registered bylaws", ie the "by-laws" prepared by a co-operative society and registered by the Registrar General of Co-Operative of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>. Such "by-law" may be amended and registered by the Registrar General under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;18.;;">s 18 of the 1993 Act</LINK>, from time to time.</p>

      <b>[67]</b> Abdul Hamid Omar CJM (as he then was) in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> had expressed his view as a general rule on the word "transactions" used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Wan Suleiman SCJ, in His Lordship's dissenting judgment, described "transaction" in the following words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> George Seah SCJ in His Lordship's dissenting judgment in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i>expressed his view as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> There are limitations to the scope of "transaction" allowable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. First, the transaction must not be inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">ss 51</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">53</LINK> as regards granting of loans and borrowing of funds by a co-operative society. Secondly the transaction must be with persons other than its members; and thirdly, such transaction shall be subject to such prohibitions or restrictions as may be prescribed by its by-laws. If the transaction is expressly prohibited by its by-laws, then it cannot be done by a co-operative society. The said transaction is thus <i>ultra vires</i> and void <i>ab initio</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> In the instant case, the exact nature of the MOD issued by the Koperasi in favour of the bank is in the form of a guarantee. On this point, Abdul Hamid Omar CJM (as he then was) in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> clearly ruled that "a guarantee is a transaction". In effect, it is a contract whereby the issuer or guarantor (in this case, the Koperasi) accepts a commitment upon happening of a certain event, and in relation to fund, it means "a sum of money pledged as a contingent indemnity for possible loss". The word "guarantee" is defined in <i>Words and Phrases Legally Defined</i> as "as accessory contract, whereby the promisor undertakes to be answerable to the promise for the debt, or miscarriage of another person, whose liability to the promise must exist or be contemplated."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> It was also expressed by Wan Suleiman SCJ in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> that "the word "transaction" will therefore include a contract of guarantee. It is in this present instance a dealing, a business activity between the respondents (the co-operative society) and the non-members."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> The main general principle applicable, agreed and adopted by all the five judges in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i>is that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> This general principle has been accepted and acted upon by the courts in England and in Malaysia. (See:<i>Colman v. Estern Counties Rly Co (supra)</i>, <i>Small v. Smith (supra)</i> and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_438;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Haji Harun Bin Haji Idris &amp; Ors</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 438</LINK>; [1977] 1 MLJ 180).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> The gist of the said general principle as stated by Salleh Abas LP and Abdul Hamid Omar CJM (as he then was) in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> is that "the word "transaction" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK> should only relate to such power as a co-operative society reasonably and properly requires for the purpose of carrying out objects of its incorporation. I would hasten to add that the word "transactions" should also relate to such power to give effect to matters covered by the rule made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51 of the Act</LINK>."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> Applying the above general principle to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK> and in view of the fact that the word "rule" as appeared in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;32.;;">s 32 of the 1948 Act</LINK>, has been substituted with the word "by-laws", we are of the view that the word "transaction" (appearing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53</LINK>) of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>, should relate to such power to give effect to matters covered by the Koperasi's by-laws, particularly paras 4 and 5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> The object or purpose of incorporation of a registered co-operative society is an important element to be considered in determining whether a 'transaction' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">s 53 of the 1993 Act</LINK> is <i>ultra vires</i> the scope of the said section. In the present case, the object or propose of the Koperasi can be found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;4.;;">s 4 of the 1993 Act</LINK> as well as paras 4 and 5 of its by-laws.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;4.;;">Section 4(1)</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> Paragraph 4 of the Koperasi's by-laws provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> As stated earlier, the issuing of the MOD by the Koperasi in favour of the bank is a part of the transactions to carry out the Koperasi's object or intention to own and develop oil palm plantations by the Contractor (EFCM) in Gua Musang, Kelantan. It is not disputed in evidence that the MOD was the most essential collateral or security to the granting of loan by the bank for the EFCM to implement the project development on a turnkey basis for the benefit of the Koperasi through its wholly own subsidiary, TPSB. According to DW2, without the MOD issued by the Koperasi, the bank would not have granted the loan facility; and without the loan facility, the lands in question in turn would not have been developed; and the Koperasi's oil-palm plantation could not have been proceeded. Therefore, the issuing of the MOD by the Koperasi cannot be treated in isolation or independently. There was clear nexus between the loan facility granted by the bank to EFCM, the oil palm project in Gua Musang, the MOD and the benefits to be derived by the Koperasi upon completion of the turnkey project through its wholly own subsidiary, TPSB. These transactions are clearly in line with the Koperasi's object for the promotion of  socioeconomic interest of its members by way of capital investment and profitable business.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> The prospective revenue for the sale of raw oil palm fruits for the Koperasi, upon completion of the project, was estimated to be RM140.00 per metric ton at that time. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;9.;;">Section 9 of the 1993 Act</LINK> and para 5(a), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of its by-laws empower the Koperasi to hold movable and immovable property of every description, to enter into contracts and to do all things necessary for the purposes for which it is constituted. In other words, the issuing of the MOD in favour of the bank "is necessary and properly required for carrying into effect" the purpose of its incorporation. In the circumtances of the present case, the MOD "is necessary and properly required for carrying into effect the object or purposes of its incorporation."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The benefits to the Koperasi will ultimately be enjoyed as benefits to its members. The evidence adduced during trial clearly supported the existence of such benefits to the Koperasi, unlike the nature of guarantees in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> and <i>Chase Manhattan (supra)</i>, which both concerned the giving of guarantees of doubtful propriety with no tangible benefit either directly or indirectly to the co-operative society or its members. The guarantees in both the cases mentioned above were purely for the benefit of the independent third party beneficiaries which had no nexus whatsoever with the co-operative societies concerned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In the present case, the Court of Appeal, on 23 July 2013, affirmed the decision of the High Court and dismissed the bank's appeal. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal, in essence, is the same as that of the High Court, save for one material difference, ie that in arriving at its decision the Court of Appeal applied <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> as amended by the 2007 Amendment which only came into effect on 1 January 2008, about 6-7 years after the relevant transactions had taken place. With due respect, the Court of Appeal had erred in applying the 2007 Amendment in determining the validity of the MOD. The relevant <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">ss 51</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;52.;;">52</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;53.;;">53 of the 1993 Act</LINK> were substantially and materially amended by the 2007 Amendment (Act A1297).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> The Court of Appeal held <i>inter alia</i> that the MOD in question was invalid and unenforceable as it was issued by the Koperasi in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51(1) of the 1993 Act</LINK> (as amended by the 2007 Amendment). At para [34] of its judgment, the Court of Appeal ruled that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51(1)</LINK> expressly prohibits a co-operative society from granting any Islamic financing or giving credit facility except to the categories of persons mentioned therein. Apparently the Court of Appeal was relying on the terms "credit facility" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51(1)</LINK> and its definition under s 2 of the 2007 Amendment. In the said definition, "credit facility" refers to the same meaning as defined in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_665;;">Malaysia Co-operative Societies Commission Act 2007 (Act 665)</LINK>, which was not even in existence then.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> With due respect, the Court of Appeal should not have relied on provisions of laws which were not in existence or not in force at the time when the relevant transactions took place in 2001 to 2002. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;19.;;">Section 19(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 (Act 388)</LINK> provides that "the commencement of an Act or subsidiary legislation shall be the date provided in or under the Act or subsidiary legislation or where no date is so provided, the date immediately following the date of its publication in pursuance of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;18.;;">s 18</LINK>".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> When the MOD was issued by the Koperasi on 22 March 2002 the words "credit facility" were not defined anywhere in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> which was applicable then. It was only when the 2007 Amendment and <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2007_665;;">Act 665</LINK> came into force in 2008 that the words "credit facility" were defined to mean, <i>inter alia</i>, "(c) the giving of a guarantee or the provision of any security in relation to the obligations of any person;" and applying the said definition, the Court of Appeal held that the MOD in question as a guarantee was a "credit facility" and therefore its issuance by the Koperasi contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">s 51</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> Since the words "credit facility" were not expressly defined in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> when the MOD was issued by the Koperasi and it was also not defined in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1948_287;;">the 1948 Act</LINK>, when <i>Malaysia Shipyard</i> was decided by the Supreme Court, the words must therefore be interpreted based on their ordinary usage in the English language, ie a facility whereby money lent or made available or the ability to obtain goods and services payment under such an arrangement that payment will be made in the future (see: <i>The Concise Oxford English Dictionary</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> "Guarantee" on the other hand, is slightly of different nature in its ordinary usage. This was clearly expressed by Abdul Hamid Omar CJM (as he then was) in <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i> in the following words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;79.;;">Section 79 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> defines a "contract of guarantee" as "a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability of a third person in case of its default ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> Without an express definition in the relevant statute which governs the transaction in question, a "guarantee" cannot be said to be a "credit facility" under the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;51.;;">ss 51</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;52.;;">52 of the 1993 Act</LINK>. In <i>Malaysia Shipyard (supra)</i>, Salleh Abas LP opined:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[91]</b>
      <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">The 1993 Act</LINK> vide the 2007 Amendment had no retrospective effect and therefore should not be considered at all in dealing with the present case. The 2007 Amendment should not affect the previous operation of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK> or anything duly done or suffered thereunder.

    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> For the abovestated reasons, the answer to Question (1) posed before this court ought to be in the negative. Since Question (1) is answered in the negative, Question (2) which exists on the assumption that the answer to Question (1) is in the affirmative therefore need not be answered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> Question (3) is only relevant and required to be answered if the MOD issued by the Koperasi in favour of the bank is not <i>ultra vires</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> Question (3) is drafted on the premise that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> The MOD issued by the Koperasi was "a continuing security, pledge or lien for the due payment to the bank by the borrower on demand of all monies due to the bank during the facility period". Under cl 2 of the MOD, the Koperasi<i>inter alia</i> "agrees and undertakes to continue to maintain the said Deposit with the bank or at such places as the bank may from time to time direct during the period of this continuing security ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> As stated earlier, cl 4 of the MOD empowers the bank to withdraw or uplift the said deposit and to apply the proceeds thereof towards the discharge of any amount due and owing to the bank, in the event the borrower (EFCM) fails to repay the loan due and owing to the bank during the facility period. However, this liberty to withdraw can only be exercised by the bank, on condition that the bank has exhausted all available legal actions or proceedings against the borrower (EFCM) and other security parties to recover the amount due and owing by the borrower to the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> Clause 13.2 of the "Facility Agreement" also provides for the same provision that "the bank hereby agrees with the borrower that in the event of the borrower commit any event of default or defaults as stipulated in cl 13.1 hereof within the Facility Period, the bank shall exhaust all available legal actions against the borrower and other Security Party before exercising the bank's right to utilise Fixed Deposit as provided by KPMNJ."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> As a matter of fact, it is not in dispute that during the facility period, the borrower (EFCM) defaulted in its repayment of the loan. On 6 December 2007, the bank unilaterally uplifted the entire deposit to reimburse itself to set off part of the debts owed by EFCM.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> The evidence clearly show (even admitted by the bank's officer - DW1) that the bank had not exhausted all actions against the borrower (EFCM) and the other security parties before exercising its right to withdraw or uplift the fixed deposit as clearly required under cl 4 of the MOD and cl 13.2 of the Facility Agreement. No action was taken against the two chargors who had expressly covenanted to repay the loan granted to the borrower (EFCM) to the extent of RM25 million. One of the properties charged by one of the chargors, was only sold by auction on 20 August 2008 (long after the fixed deposit had been uplifted on 6 December 2007). The bank apparently had sued the borrower (EFCM) and the individual guarantors and obtained judgment in default against them on 22 June 2007. However, no execution proceedings whatsoever were taken against them to enforce the said judgment in default. Yet, the bank proceeded unilaterally to uplift the fixed deposit on 6 December 2007. Clearly, the unilateral uplifting of the fixed deposit under the circumstances, amounted to a clear violation of the proviso to cl 4 of the MOD and cl 13.1 of the Facility Agreement by the bank. The said uplifting was premature and contractually invalid. In this respect, the High Court and the Court of Appeal were correct in coming to their decision that the bank's act amounted to a breach of contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> As has been held earlier, the MOD dated 22 March 2002 issued by the Koperasi in favour of the bank was valid and enforceable; and not <i>ultra vires</i> the relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>. Being a continuing security pledge or lien for the due payment to the bank during the facility period, the MOD binds and can be enforced by both parties, the bank, as well as the Koperasi. However, we are of the view that breach by the bank in prematurely uplifting the entire fixed deposit in violation of the proviso to cl 4 of the MOD did not render the MOD void <i>ab initio</i>. In the circumstances of the case, all that the Koperasi is entitled to is to be put in a position as if the breach had not occurred. If the breach had, in any way, resulted loss to the Koperasi, damages would have to be assessed, so far as money could do so, to compensate the Koperasi by placing it in the same position as if the breach had not occurred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[101]</b> The above proposition was adopted by Parke R in <i>Robinson v. Harman</i> [1843-1860] All ER Rep 383 at p 385 when he said "where a party sustain a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed." If the Koperasi is to be put in a better position than it would have been if there had been no breach by the bank in prematurely uplifting the fixed deposit, then it would be contrary to the principle enunciated in established authorities. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_420;"><i>Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat &amp; Anor v. Plenitude Holdings Sdn Bhd</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 420</LINK>; [1995] 1 CLJ 15,<i>Koufos v. C Czarnikow Ltd</i> [1969] 1 AC 350 and <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i> [1854] 156 ER 145).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[102]</b> In the present case, the order of the High Court (and affirmed by the Court of Appeal) directing the return of the fixed deposit amount placed under the MOD to the Koperasi, when the loan for the purpose of the project development was disbursed by the bank based on the certifications of works done by the Koperasi and the oil palm plantations project was 63.4% completed, is clearly against the above settled principle that the Koperasi should not be put in a better position than it would have been if the breach by the bank did not take place. All that should have been ordered in the present case is for reinstatement of the fixed deposits (with interest that would have accrued on them) subject to terms of the MOD which has earlier been held to be valid and enforceable in law (see: <i>C &amp; P Haulage (a firm) v. Middleton</i> [1983] 3 All ER 94).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[103]</b> For the various reasons adumbrated above and in view of the fact that the answer to Question (1) is in the negative, the answer to Question (3) should be that the Koperasi (as the chargor in the MOD) is only entitled to the reinstatement or restoration of the fixed deposit money (with any interest that would have accrued) subject to the terms of the MOD (the charge).</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Bank's Counterclaim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[104]</b> The bank's counterclaim against the Koperasi is for the sum of RM12 million (with interest and costs) being shortfall, the Koperasi had agreed or undertook to pay progressively as security deposit pursuant to the MOD issued by the Koperasi in its favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[105]</b> Under the MOD, the Koperasi agreed to deposit and charge in favour of the bank the total sum of RM25 million only as a continuing security pledge or lien for the due payment of the loan by EFCM particularly as specified in the schedule thereto, as follow:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[106]</b> On 1 June 2003, the Koperasi however had only deposited and pledged the sum of RM13 million with the bank under the MOD. By various letters (between 11 March 2004 and 27 December 2005) the bank had requested the Koperasi to deposit the shortfall of RM12 million due under the terms of the MOD. The Koperasi however, failed to response. Consequently on 6 December 2007, the bank uplifted the RM13 million deposit pledged under the MOD.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[107]</b> In its defence to the counterclaim, the Koperasi denied liability on the sole ground that the MOD in question was issued beyond its scope of authority or power, under the relevant laws, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;;">the 1993 Act</LINK>; and therefore was void <i>ab initio</i> and unenforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[108]</b> The High Court agreed with the Koperasi that the MOD was <i>ultra vires</i> and therefore void <i>ab initio</i> and unenforceable. On 19 June 2012, the Koperasi's claim was allowed and the bank's counterclaim was dismissed with costs. On 27 June 2012, the bank filed a notice of appeal, appealing against the whole decision of the High Court. Effectively, the appeal included that part of the decision dismissing the bank's counterclaim with costs. In the Memorandum of Appeal (to the Court of Appeal) the bank also stated that "the appeal was against the whole of the said decision". In (para 3) of its Memorandum of Appeal, the bank claimed <i>inter alia</i> that the learned Judicial Commissioner had erred in law and in fact when he dismissed the bank's counterclaim for the balance of RM12 million to be paid to the bank pursuant to the MOD. The Court of Appeal on 3 June 2014 dismissed the bank's appeal (which in effect includes the bank's appeal on its counterclaim).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[109]</b> The bank then, having obtained leave to appeal on 20 January 2014 appealed to this Court against the whole decision of the Court of Appeal. The first ground listed by the bank in its Memorandum of Appeal dated 7 March 2014 states that: "The Court of Appeal erred in law and in fact in affirming the decision of the High Court dated 19 June 2012, which allowed the respondent's (the Koperasi's) claim and dismissed the appellant's (the bank's) appeal."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[110]</b> In his submissions before us, learned counsel for the bank raised the issue of its counterclaim to the effect that the counterclaim should be allowed and judgment entered against the Koperasi for the sum of RM12 million, together with interest at 5% per annum from 1 June 2003 or such other date as may be ordered until the full payment, to be held under the terms of the MOD in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[111]</b> With the above background, we feel that the issue of the bank's counterclaim is part of the present appeal before us and it is only proper and appropriate for this court to deal with it here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[112]</b> The facts (based on the evidence available) that form the basis of the bank's counterclaim against the Koperasi are quite simple and straightforward. It is based on the validity of the MOD issued by the Koperasi to the bank. At the courts below (both High Court and the Court of Appeal) the bank's counterclaim was dismissed with costs on the sole reason that the MOD in question was void <i>ab initio</i> and unenforceable. But in this court, as we have concluded earlier that the MOD is (and still is) valid and enforceable. In effect it binds both parties, the bank and the Koperasi according to its terms.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[113]</b> The schedule to the MOD, which is referred to in para 1.1 thereof, clearly and expressly provides that the total agreed amount of RM25 million needs to be deposited with the bank by 1 June 2003. Unfortunately, the Koperasi failed to fulfil this obligation, despite various reminders sent by the bank thus in breach of an important term of the MOD. The records show that as on 1 June 2003 the Koperasi had only deposited the sum of RM13 million with the bank, thus leaving a shortfall of RM12 million. Contractually, the Koperasi had committed a breach of its own MOD as agreed between them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[114]</b> The loan had been disbursed and the project in question had substantially been completed. According to the bank's records, it had in total disbursed the sum of RM23,935,050 under the loan facility for the purpose of the project. Any dispute as to the physical implementation of the project must be dealt with between the Koperasi and EFCM as the contractor based on the terms of the Development and Plantation Agreement dated 12 November 2001 entered into between the Koperasi and EFCM. The issue of noncompletion of the project is not the concern of the bank. The bank's obligation is to provide and disburse the loan as certified by the Koperasi in accordance with the Facility Agreement as well as the MOD. The bank may have been at fault in prematurely uplifting the deposit in violation of cl 4 of the MOD, but that alone cannot be a ground for the Koperasi to refuse or neglect to fulfil its obligation to make payment as stipulated in the schedule to the MOD. Clause 15 of the MOD provides, <i>inter alia</i>, "... nor shall any single partial or defective exercise by the bank of any such right power privilege or remedy preclude any other further exercise under this Memorandum of Deposit or any other power privilege or remedy."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[115]</b> For the above reason and since the MOD is valid and enforceable, it is our considered view that the Koperasi is obliged to make payment for the shortfall of the deposit and therefore the bank's counterclaim must be allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[116]</b> The factual matrix of the present case before us clearly shows that the Koperasi was the main participant throughout the whole transactions right from the beginning when it decided to acquire the whole equity in TPSB for the purpose of developing oil palm plantation for its own benefit in Gua Musang, Kelantan, until the time when it made a complete 'u-turn' claiming that the MOD issued by it for the purpose of obtaining loan from the bank which had effectively generated substantial benefit to it at the expense of the bank. In the circumstances, the conduct of the Koperasi was plainly inequitable and unconscionable which no court of law can condone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[117]</b> for the various reasons adumbrated above, we hold that the answer to Question (1) ought to be in the negative. Question (2) which exists and only relevant on the assumption that the answer to Question (1) is in the affirmative need not be answered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[118]</b> Since the answer to Question (1) is in the negative, Question (3) ought to be answered that the Koperasi (as the chargor in the MOD) is only entitled to the restoration of the money (with any interest that would have accrued) on deposit subject to the terms of the MOD which is still valid, enforceable and binding on the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[119]</b> The bank's counterclaim against the Koperasi is allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[120]</b> In the upshot, we therefore allow the bank's appeals with costs and set aside the decision of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. We make an order that the bank to reinstate the fixed deposit money (with interest that would have accrued) subject to the terms of the MOD, within 30 days from today. We also make an order that the Koperasi is to make payment for the shortfall of the deposit within 30 days from today.</p>
