    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff is an operator of an aluminium smelting plant in Sarawak whilst the defendant, as the lead takaful operator, had agreed with the plaintiff to insure machinery breakdown and loss of profit. Following a power outage which affected Sarawak statewide, there was serious disruption and damage to the plant which caused the plaintiff to suffer tremendous and substantial loss and damage. The plaintiff duly informed the defendant of this incident. Subsequently, by a coverage letter, the defendant had disclaimed its liability in respect of the plaintiff's claim. Together with the coverage letter, the defendant issued a Notice of Arbitration. The plaintiff informed the defendant by a letter that the plaintiff was not agreeable to refer the dispute for arbitration. Later, the plaintiff filed this suit seeking for, among others, indemnity in respect of all losses and damages arising from the incident. The plaintiff submitted that as the arbitration clause was not part of the contract of insurance between the plaintiff and the defendant, there was not an arbitration agreement in place and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the Arbitration Act 2005 ('the said Act')</LINK> had no applicability in this case. The argument was also put that the defendant's breach of good faith and alleged fraud took it out of the compass of the said Act. The High Court allowed the defendant's application pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the said Act</LINK> to stay proceedings pending the matter being referred to arbitration. Hence, the present appeal against the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appellant's appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Under the said Act, the court had no discretion but to grant a stay save and except for the exceptions set out above in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1) of the said Act</LINK>. The arbitration clause was a clear part of the contract between the parties and it was not a nullity or incapable of being performed. At any rate the question of whether the arbitration clause was a part of the contract of insurance between the parties or not was a matter that went to jurisdiction of the appointment of the arbitrator and the arbitrator was competent to deal with that issue at the arbitration itself. As a matter of policy, the courts should be slow to place technical hurdles against having the matter referred to arbitration in the face of the clear injunction to do so by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the said Act</LINK>. (para 5)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The plaintiff had raised the issue of fraud and breach of good faith and submitted that plea took it out of the compass of the said Act. A reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1) of the said Act</LINK> clearly showed that could not be the case, and all such matters were capable of being subject to Arbitration. There were in fact several disputes between the parties with regard to matters to be referred and therefore came within the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1)(b) of the said Act</LINK>. (paras 6-7)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> If the courts were to decide whether or not a claim was disputable, they were doing precisely what the parties had agreed should be done by the private tribunal. An arbitrator's very function was to decide whether or not there was a good defence to the claimant's claim, in other words, whether or not the claim was in truth indisputable. There was no good reason why the courts should strive to take matters out of the hands of the tribunal into which the parties had by agreement undertaken to place them. (para 9)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal was heard on the 30th day of October 2014. The appeal arose from an application made by the respondent (defendant) (encl 4) pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the Arbitration Act 2005 (the said Act)</LINK> and/or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court to stay proceedings in the High Court pending the matter being referred to Arbitration (at pp 115-116 of the Appeal Record vol 1). The appellant (plaintiff) opposed the application. The High Court granted the said order sought (at p 35 of the Appeal Record vol 1). The plaintiff appealed to this court on 18 June 2014 (at pp 37-38 of the Appeal Record vol 1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Facts germane to this appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiff submits that as the arbitration clause was not part of the contract of insurance between the plaintiff and the defendant, there was not an arbitration agreement in place and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10</LINK> has no applicability in this case. The argument was also put that the defendant's breach of good faith and alleged fraud took it out of the compass of the said Act. The defendant argues that the arbitration clause was part of the contract of insurance between the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We first set out in full <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1)</LINK> of the said Act on which the application of the respondent in the High Court was premised and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Under the said Act, the court has no discretion but to grant a stay save and except for the exceptions set out above in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1) of the said Act</LINK>. The learned judge held and we agree, the arbitration clause is clear, part of the contract between the parties and it is not a nullity or incapable of being performed. At any rate. The question of whether the arbitration clause is a part of the contract of insurance between the parties or not is a matter that goes to jurisdiction of the appointment of the arbitrator and the arbitrator is competent to deal with that issue at the arbitration itself (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;18.;;">s 18 of the said Act</LINK>). As a matter of policy, the courts should be slow to place technical hurdles against having the matter referred to arbitration in the face of the clear injunction to do so by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the said Act</LINK>. We refer to the commentary on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1)(a)</LINK> contained in the text of <i>Arbitration Act 2005: Uncitral Model Law As Applied In Malaysia</i>, by Sundra Rajoo &amp; WSW Davidson and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We also refer to the same text on the arbitration agreement at paras 18.9, 18.10 and 18.11 and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The plaintiff has also raised the issue of fraud and breach of good faith and submits that plea takes it out of the compass of the said Act. A reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1) of the said Act</LINK> clearly shows that that cannot be the case, and all such matters are capable of being subject to Arbitration and we are therefore of the view that the learned judge was right in granting the stay sought.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> To our mind, there are in fact several disputes between the parties with regard to matters to be referred and therefore come within the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1)(b) of the said Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We refer to the dictum of Lord Justices Templeman, and Fox in <i>Ellerine Bros (Pty) Ltd v. Klinger</i> [1982] 1 WLR 1375 and we quote from the judgment of His Lordship Lord Justice Templeman (with respect) and with approval at p 1383 onward:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In the third place, if the courts are to decide whether or not a claim is disputable, they are doing precisely what the parties have agreed should be done by the private tribunal. An arbitrator's very function is to decide whether or not there is a good defence to the claimant's claim - in other words, whether or not the claim is in truth indisputable. Again, to our mind, whatever the position in the past, when the courts tended to view arbitration clauses as tending to oust their jurisdiction, the modern view (in line with the basic principles of the English law of freedom of contract and indeed International Conventions) is that there is no good reason why the courts should strive to take matters out of the hands of the tribunal into which the parties have by agreement undertaken to place them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> For all the aforesaid reasons we dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
