    <p>The defendant had executed a "Heads of Agreement" ("agreement") with KLF Multioto Sdn Bhd which was assigned to the plaintiff. Based on the agreement, the plaintiff said it was to be the exclusive service provider subject to a formal definitive agreement. The formal agreement was not executed and the agreement lapsed. The plaintiff commenced action against the defendant in the High Court. The High Court found there was no concluded contract but ordered assessment of damages on a <i>quantum meruit</i> basis. There was also no finding by the High Court that the defendant had enjoyed the benefit of the plaintiff's service or contribution. The defendant appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, there was no concluded contract. It was a condition precedent in the "Heads of Agreement" for the need of a concluded contract. When the intention of the parties was clear that there must be a concluded contract, contractual jurisprudence would not permit the court to rewrite the agreement between the parties, unless there was an exception. (para 10(a))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <i>Quantum meruit</i> was not the pleaded case of the plaintiff and the law did not permit the court to assess damages based on <i>quantum meruit</i> when there was no evidence to say the defendant had any benefit. (para 10(b))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> On the factual matrix of the case, the pleadings of the parties as well as the evidence, no form of liability could be attached to the defendant. (para 11)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/defendant appealed against the decision of the learned High Court judge who had ordered assessment of damages on <i>quantum meruit</i> basis when it was not the pleaded case of the respondent/plaintiff, that too where upon finding there was no concluded contract and the points of agreement which the plaintiff had relied on had expired.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard the appeal on 2 October 2014 and were unanimous in allowing the appeal. My learned brother Abdul Wahab Patail JCA and learned sister Umi Kalthum Abdul Majid JCA had read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminaries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The learned trial judge had written an eight pages' judgment in a style citing no authorities for the various propositions made by the judge or the counsel in the matter, making it difficult for appellate assessment on the decision. On the issue related to the case, the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On the issue of liability and quantum, the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On the face of the record, the judgment cannot be sustained as it was not the pleaded case of the plaintiff to seek damages on <i>quantum meruit</i> basis. In addition, it was not the pleaded case of the plaintiff that the defendant did enjoy the benefit of the plaintiff's service or contribution. There was also no finding by the learned trial judge that the defendant benefited in consequence of the plaintiff's service and/or contribution. In fact, the defendant's defence in paras 4 to 5 was not challenged or debunked by the plaintiff in any material form for the plaintiff to succeed when the defendant's evidence in the trial was consistent with the statement of defence. That part of the defence reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We do not think much judicial time should be expended to set out the facts and law as it has been well articulated by the learned counsel for the appellant/ defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In the instant case, the defendant had executed 'Heads of Agreement' with KLF Multioto Sdn Bhd which was assigned to the plaintiff. Based on the agreement, the plaintiff/respondent said it was to be the exclusive service provider subject to a formal definitive agreement. The said formal agreement was not executed. It was a condition precedent that a formal agreement must be executed. It was also not in dispute that 'Heads of Agreement' had lapsed. In addition, it must be noted under the Heads of Agreement, the defendant will not be liable for any monetary payment and that part of the defendant's defence has been set out earlier. We do not wish to repeat.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Learned counsel for the defendant stated the main issues for the determination are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned counsel for the plaintiff/respondent did not dispute that there are only three issues and the above submission of the appellant in material form. The respondent's main line of argument was that it was a finding of fact by the trial judge, even though they agreed that the <i>quantum meruit</i> was not pleaded. However, they stated that the conduct of the defendant to allow the plaintiff to perform the task with its knowledge entitled it (the plaintiff) to succeed in its claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We have read the Appeal Record and the submission of the parties in detail. We thank the learned counsel for the comprehensive submission. After much consideration to the submission of the  plaintiff's counsel, we took the view that the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On the factual matrix of the case, the pleadings of the parties as well as the evidence, we did not think any form of liability could be attached to the appellant/defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> For reasons stated above, we allowed the appeal with costs of RM30,000.00 to be paid by the respondent/plaintiff to the appellant/defendant here and below. The judgment of the High Court was set aside. The deposit was refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We hereby ordered so.</p>
