    <p>The appellant had pursued a Master's degree under a scholarship granted to him by the respondent university and, accordingly, served the respondent for three years upon completion of his Master's degree as required under the scholarship agreement. Thereafter, the appellant was sponsored by the respondent for a PhD degree at University Putra Malaysia ('UPM') and was required to serve six years with the respondent upon completion thereof. However, after serving two years and 17 days with the respondent upon completion of his PhD, the appellant applied to the respondent for a release as he had an appointment with UPM for the position of lecturer. The respondent vide a letter dated 26 July 2005 granted the appellant a conditional release, <i>inter alia</i>, to make a lump sum payment in breach of the scholarship agreement concerned, and if unable to comply, the appellant had the option of not accepting the appointment with UPM. Then two days later <i>vide</i> a letter dated 28 July 2005 the respondent appeared to have granted the appellant an unconditional release without the said impediments and allowed the appellant to proceed with his appointment with UPM. The respondent however brought a claim for liquidated damages against the appellant and the High Court allowed the claim in the sum of RM247,071. The appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondent's letter of 28 July 2005 clearly did not contain any conditions. Both letters of 26 July 2005 and 28 July 2005 were addressed to the appellant and signed by the same officer. There was no question of administrative confusion of two officers sending out letters for one approval. It was evident that while the letter of 26 July 2005 conveyed the consent or approval of the Vice-Chancellor with conditions, the letter of 28 July 2005 conveyed the decision of the respondent without conditions. (paras 8-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The appellant's obligations under the scholarship agreement were to the respondent. The letter of 28 July 2005 conveying the decision of the respondent therefore overrode the Vice-Chancellor's consent or approval conveyed in the letter of 26 July 2005. Estoppel applied to estop the respondent from relying on the letter of 26 July 2005 and the scholarship agreement. (paras 12-13)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The defendant, Mohd Bakri Ishak ("the appellant") appealed to this court against the decision of the High Court in favour of a claim by the plaintiff, UNIVERSITI UTARA MALAYSIA ("the respondent") for liquidated damages in the sum of RM247,071.47 for breach of the Scholarship Agreement entered into between the respondent and the appellant on 17 September 1997 ("the first agreement") and 14 July 2000 ("the second agreement").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant was required, after completing the Master's degree sponsored under the first agreement, to serve the respondent a period of three years. Having completed his Master's degree, the appellant returned and served with the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> While serving the respondent, the appellant applied for and obtained an offer from the respondent to sponsor the appellant to pursue a PhD degree at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). Accepting the offer, the appellant entered into the second agreement, under which the appellant was required, upon completion, to serve the respondent for six years. Accordingly upon completion of his PhD degree, the appellant returned and served with the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> But two years 17 days after completion of his PhD degree and reporting to the respondent, the appellant applied by letter dated 29 August 2004 to UPM for the position of Associate Professor. The appellant received a letter of offer from UPM dated 24 May 2005 for appointment as a lecturer. By a letter dated 4 June 2005, the appellant applied to the respondent for a release from the respondent and for his service to be transferred to UPM.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> By a letter dated 26 July 2005, the respondent granted the appellant a release with conditions attached. By a letter two days later, dated 28 July 2005, the respondent appeared to grant the appellant an unconditional release.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> There was no dispute that the letter dated 26 July 2005 (exh P7) imposed conditions, <i>inter alia</i>, that the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The letter dated 28 July 2005 is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> From the above, it was clear that the letter dated 28 July 2005 did not contain any conditions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In considering the significance of the letter dated 28 July 2005, we noted that both letters were addressed to the appellant and signed by the same officer, Mohamad Fadzil Hj Samiran, Bahagian Pengurusan Sumber Manusia bp Pendaftar. There was no question of administrative confusion of two officers sending out letters for one approval.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Re-examining the letter of 26 July 2005, we noted that para 2 stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was evident that while the letter of 26 July 2005 conveyed the consent or approval of the Vice-Chancellor, with conditions, the letter of 28 July 2005, as reproduced at para [7] above conveyed the decision of the University, without conditions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We noted that the appellant's obligations under the first and the second agreements were to the University. The letter of 28 July 2005, conveying the decision of the University, therefore overrode the Vice-Chancellor's consent or approval conveyed in the letter of 26 July 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We observed that the letter of 26 July 2005 imposed the condition that the payment be made in one lump sum ("sekaligus"). If unable to comply, the appellant had the option of not accepting the appointment at Universiti Putra Malaysia. The letter of 28 July 2005 imposed no such impediment and allowed the appellant to proceed to accept his appointment. In the event, estoppel would apply to estop the respondent from relying on the letter of 26 July 2005 and the first and the second agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We, therefore, allowed the appeal with costs in the sum of RM10,000.00, set aside the order of the High Court and ordered that the deposit be refunded.</p>
