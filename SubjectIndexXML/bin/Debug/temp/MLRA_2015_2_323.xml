    <p>In the instant case, the appellant was driving a car ("the car") through the Immigration Complex, Bukit Kayu Hitam, when he was stopped at the customs checkpoint by customs officer, Abdul Halim Bin Ismail ("PW4") and was asked to open the boot of the car. Inside the boot of the car, PW4 found a bag with a trolley ("exh P57"). Upon examining exh P57, PW4's suspicions were aroused when he discovered several packages inside. At this juncture, the appellant pleaded for help and tried to bribe PW4 by offering him money. Following that, PW4 contacted one Khamis bin Kamal ("PW5"), an enforcement officer, to assist him. PW5 examined the boot of the car and recovered exh P57. The appellant then tried to bribe PW5 with money and pleaded for the matter to be settled. The appellant and the car along with exh P57 were then brought to the store of the Customs Enforcement Unit, where one Mohamad Marzuki bin Ahmad ("PW7") along with the officer on duty, one Mohd Nor bin Hamid ("PW6"), were informed about the incident. Upon inspection by PW6, exh P57 contained 41 slabs or packages, which were weighed by PW6 and handed over to PW7. The 41 slabs or packages were then sent by PW7 to the chemist ("PW2") who conducted the analysis and found the 41 slabs or packages to contain heroin ("the drugs"). Consequently, the appellant was charged with trafficking in heroin under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act")</LINK>. At the close of the prosecution's case, the Judicial Commissioner ("JC") found that the prosecution had succeeded in proving a <i>
prima facie</i> case against the appellant and found that the appellant's defence was improbable and failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. Therefore, the appellant was found guilty, convicted and sentenced to death. In this appeal, the appellant raised, <i>inter alia</i>, the following issues: whether there were two sets of judgment by the JC, one dated 15 November 2011 ("the first judgment") an the second dated 26 January 2012 ("the second judgment"); whether the JC was right in holding that the appellant had <i>mens rea</i> possession over the drugs found in exh P57; whether the identity of the drugs was doubtful due to the discrepancy between the gross weight of the drugs found by PW2 and PW6; and whether the appellant's defence of innocent carrier had been sufficiently considered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The alleged first judgment delivered by the JC had at the outset been qualified by the JC as "Ini adalah keputusan ringkas saya di akhir kes pembelaan". Based on the principle in <i>Lim Guan Eng v. PP &amp; Other Appeals</i>, there was a distinction between "keputusan ringkas", ie the first judgment and a written judgment, which was the second judgment here. Further, following <i>Yusof Omar lwn. PP</i>, it was not procedurally wrong for the JC to give a brief judgment at the end of the defence case. The brief judgment was meant for the court to state briefly its reasons for finding the appellant guilty at the end of the defence case. In other words, the fact that the brief judgment (first judgment) was written, read and recorded did not make it a signed written judgment within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;307.;;">s 307(3) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. Therefore, the issue of two written judgments did not arise here. (<i>Lorraine Phylis Cohen &amp; Anor v. PP (distd)</i>). (paras 24-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> From the evidence adduced, the appellant tried to bribe PW4 before the drugs were recovered. The evidence of PW5 corroborated the evidence of PW4 on the conduct of the appellant. Further, the appellant also attempted to bribe PW5. Thus, based on the available evidence and established principles of law on the applicability of evidence of conduct to infer knowledge (<i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP (refd)</i>), the JC had rightly made an affirmative finding in inferring knowledge and <i>mens rea</i> possession through the conduct of the appellant before resorting to the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(i) of the Act</LINK>. Furthermore, in view of the large quantity of drugs involved, the reasonable inference that could be drawn was that the appellant was in fact carrying it for the purpose of trafficking and not for his own consumption. (<i>Ong Ah Chuan v. PP And Another Appeal (refd); PP v. Abdul Manaf Muhamad Hassan (refd)</i>). (paras 34, 36 &amp; 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The evidence adduced showed that PW6 had used a non-calibrated weighing scale. Therefore, the difference in the gross weight as found by PW6 as opposed to the gross weight found by PW2 was due to the non-calibrated weighing scale. Further, both PW6 and PW7 confirmed and identified that exh P57 contained the drugs and these were the same drugs which were handed over to PW2 for a chemical analysis and returned to PW7. Applying <i>Loh Kah Loon v. PP</i> and based on the evidence adduced, the drugs seized and examined were the same drugs that were produced before the High Court and upon which the appellant was charged. There was no break in the chain of evidence that could have created a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the drugs. (paras 39 &amp; 42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Although no reference was made by the JC to the term "innocent carrier", it was clear that the JC had considered the appellant's defence in his written judgment. Sufficient and credible evidence had been adduced to show that the appellant's conduct was consistent with the knowledge of the drugs when he tried to avoid, pleaded for help and attempted continuously to bribe PW4 and PW5. Accordingly, the appellant was not an innocent carrier and knew all along that he was in the process of transporting the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. From the totality of the evidence adduced, there was ample evidence to support the necessary inference that the appellant had control and custody of the drugs. The appellant had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> nor had he succeeded in raising any reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.

      <b>Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant before us was charged and convicted of trafficking in 12,028.4 grams of heroin under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK> and punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the same</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The charge against the appellant reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Salient Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The facts of this case have been comprehensively set out in the grounds of judgment of the learned Judicial Commissioner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> They are briefly as follows:</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 8 May 2010 at about 12.30pm, the appellant was driving a dark green Wira bearing registration number KAQ 6618 through the Immigration Complex, Bukit Kayu Hitam. He was stopped at the customs checkpoint by Abdul Halim Bin Ismail (PW4) and was asked to open the boot of the car. Inside the boot of the car, PW4 found a bag with a trolley (exh P57). Upon examining the bag (exh P57), PW4's suspicions were aroused and he requested his colleague to assist him. At this juncture, the appellant pleaded for help and tried to bribe PW4 by offering him a wad of RM50.00 notes. This was ignored by PW4 who refused to take the money and instead took the appellant's car keys to prevent him from running away. Later, PW4 contacted one Khamis bin Kamal (PW5) an enforcement officer with the Bahagian Peguatkuasaan Kastam who came over to assist him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> PW5 examined the boot of the car and recovered a bag (exh P57) containing several chocolate coloured packages. PW5 directed the appellant to go into the car and asked for his identity card. At that moment the appellant was trembling and he looked nervous and frightened. He then tried to bribe PW5 with a wad of RM50.00 notes and pleaded for the matter to be settled. PW5 then called another customs officer, one Jayadevan to handcuff the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> PW5 took the appellant's car keys from PW4 and brought the appellant and his car to the store of the Customs Enforcement Unit, Bukit Kayu Hitam. At the store, PW5 telephoned the Senior Assistant Director of Customs, Mohamad Marzuki bin Ahmad (PW7) to inform him about the incident. He also informed the officer on duty, one Md Nor bin Hamid (PW6) about the arrest of the appellant and the seizure of the car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> PW6 came to the store and directed the appellant to take out exh P57 from the boot of the car and place it on the table. He then directed the appellant to take out one of the packages from the bag. PW6 discovered that the package contained white powder. PW6 immediately reported the matter to PW7 who then directed PW6 to carry out further examination and to prepare a report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> PW6 then instructed PW5 and Jayadevan to examine exh P57. From exh P57 they recovered 41 chocolate coloured packages. PW6 only opened the first package. All 41 packages were weighed and the gross weight was found to be 16.135 kilograms. PW6 then handed over the appellant together with the recovered items to PW7. PW6 lodged a police report at 5.30pm on the same day.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The exhibits (all 41 slabs or packages) were sent by PW7 to the Chemistry Department for analysis on 13 May 2010. The chemist (PW2) who conducted the analysis found the 41 slabs to contain 12,028.4 grams of heroin.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court At The Close Of The Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> At the close of the prosecution's case, the court found that the prosecution had succeeded in proving a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On the issue of possession His Lordship following <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_44;"><i>Chan Pean Leon v. PP</i> [1956] 1 MLRH 44</LINK>; [1956] 1 MLJ 237 found firstly, that the evidence before the court gave rise to the inference that the appellant had custody and control of the drugs in question. This was how the learned Judicial Commissioner put it:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Secondly, on the issue of knowledge or <i>mens rea'</i> possession the learned Judicial Commissioner relied on the evidence of PW4 and PW5 to infer knowledge by way of the appellant's conduct as can be seen from the following passage of His Lordship's judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Thus His Lordship found upon a maximum evaluation of the evidence, in particular the evidence of PW4 and PW5 that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> His Lordship was also satisfied that based on the chemist's report the prosecution had proved that the contents of the 41 slabs or packages were dangerous drugs, to wit, heroin.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner also found that the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the DDA</LINK> was correctly invoked by the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Based on his findings above, the learned Judicial Commissioner found a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established against the appellant and he called on the appellant to enter his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellant's Defence And Court's Finding At The Close Of The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The defence of the appellant was that he had no knowledge that the bag (exh P57) left by his brother in the car contained drugs. Essentially his defence was that the bag, exh P57 belonged to his brother and he was framed by his brother.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We will deal with the appellant's defence in greater detail in the later part of this judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner found the appellant's defence that his brother, Ong Keng Loon framed him improbable and failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The appellant's defence in short, was a bare denial. The appellant was therefore found guilty, convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>The appellant raised numerous grounds of appeal in his petition of appeal. However, before us learned counsel for the appellant, Mr Ranjit Singh Dhilon confined himself to four issues only namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>1. Whether There Were Two Sets Of Judgment, One Dated 15 November 2011 And The Second Dated 26 January 2012?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant argued that there were two sets of judgments in this case. The first judgment dated 15 November, 2011 which can be seen at PP 85-86 vol 1 of the Appeal Record whereas the second judgment dated some two months later on 26 January 2012, is set out at pp 88-102 vol 1 of the Appeal Record. Learned counsel relied on the Supreme Court decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_180;"><i>Lorraine Phylis Cohen &amp; Anor v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 180</LINK>; [1989] 2 MLJ 288; [1989] 1 CLJ 84 to contend that it is wrong in principle to allow a judge to supplement his original written judgment by a second judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant contended that in supplementing his first judgment with a second judgment, the learned Judicial Commissioner had acted contrary to the requirements of procedural fairness as envisaged by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> which could not be cured under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (CJA)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The alleged "first judgment" on 15 November 2011 was delivered by the learned Judicial Commissioner following submissions by the prosecution and defence on 16 October 2011 after the close of the defence case on 2 October 2011. Before delivering his brief judgment on 15 November 2011, the learned Judicial Commissioner had at the outset qualified his brief judgment by stating as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_457;"><i>Lim Guan Eng v.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Based on the aforesaid principle there is therefore a distinction between "keputusan ringkas" which in our case is what the "first judgment" clearly is and "written judgment", which is the "second judgment" here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In this regard, the observations of the Court of Appeal in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_227;"><i>Yusof Omar lwn. PP</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 227</LINK>; [2001] 2 MLJ 209; [2001] 3 CLJ 122; [2001] 2 AMR 1429 at p 237 is particularly apposite:</p>

PP</i>, we are of the view that it is not procedurally wrong for the learned Judicial Commissioner to give a brief judgment at the end of the defence case. The brief judgment is meant for the court to state briefly its reasons for finding the accused (the appellant in this case) guilty at the end of the defence case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> As succinctly put by the Court of Appeal (<i>supra</i>):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In other words the fact that the brief judgment (or first judgment in this case) was written, read and recorded did not make it a signed written judgment within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;307.;;">s 307(3) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Hence, the issue of two written judgments did not arise here. The case of <i>Lorraine Phylis Cohen &amp; Anor v. Public Prosecutor</i> is distinguished.</p>
    <p>
      <b>2. Whether The Learned Judicial Commissioner Was Right In Holding That The Appellant Had Mens Rea Possession Over The Drugs Found In Exhibit P57?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> PW4 saw the appellant was driving a motorcar bearing registration number KAQ 6618 ("the said car") when he arrived at the Bukit Kayu Hitam customs checkpoint and all along till his arrest, PW4 and PW5 confirmed the appellant was alone. The proscribed drugs were found in the boot of the car inside exh P57 and judging by the proximity of the appellant to the drugs, it was clearly deducible that he was found to be in physical custody and control of the drugs. (See para 13, p 93, vol 1, Appeal Record - reproduced at p 5 of this judgment (<i>supra</i>)).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> As stated earlier, the learned Judicial Commissioner had relied on the evidence of PW4 and PW5 to infer knowledge by way of the appellant's conduct. For ease of reference the evidence of PW4 is reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It can be seen from the above evidence that the appellant tried to bribe PW4 twice even before the drugs were recovered. The evidence of PW5 corroborated the evidence of PW4 on the conduct of the appellant which appeared to be fearful. The appellant attempted further to bribe PW5 after some suspicious packages were found carefully wrapped in exh P57. This is reflected in PW5's evidence which was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_5_676;"><i>PP v. Kesavan Petchayo @ Balakrishnan</i> [2000] 5 MLRH 676</LINK>; [2000] 7 MLJ 144, the evidence of PW3 showed that the accused, upon being stopped and the package taken from him, had gone on his knees, held on to PW3's leg, wept and sought to explain the packages did not belong to him. These events took place even before the drugs were found. Abdul Wahab Patail J (a High Court Judge then) held, at p 680:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> On the evidence available and based on established principles of law on the applicability of evidence of conduct to infer knowledge (see the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717), it is our judgment that the learned Judicial Commissioner had rightly made an affirmative finding when he inferred knowledge and '<i>mens rea</i> possession' through the conduct of the appellant before resorting to the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(i) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In the instant case, each slab of the drugs in question had been carefully wrapped to avoid detection in the transporting process. Unfortunately, the appellant was stopped at the customs checkpoint. PW4 and PW5 saw that the appellant was desperately attempting to bribe them fully aware of the consequences if he were to be arrested. In view of the large quantity of drugs involved, the reasonable inference that may be drawn is that the appellant was in fact carrying it for the purpose of trafficking and not for his own consumption. (The cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_283;"><i>Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor And Another Appeal</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 283</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 64 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_319;"><i>PP v. Abdul Manaf Muhamad Hassan</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 319</LINK>; [2006] 3 MLJ 193; [2006] 2 CLJ 129; [2006] 4 AMR 477 are referred).</p>
    <p>
      <b>3. Whether There Is Doubt As To The Identity Of The Exhibit As The Gross Weight Of The Drugs As Found By The Chemist (PW2) Was Higher Than The Gross Weight Found By The Assistant Raiding Officer (PW6)?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Counsel for the appellant alleged that there is doubt as to the identity of the drugs seized. It was argued that the gross weight of the drugs found by the chemist was higher than the gross weight found by PW6 which was 16,188.9 grams compared to 16,135.0 grams as found by the latter. Thus, there was a difference of 53.9 grams between the gross weight of the drug exhibits as found by PW2 and PW6. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the difference in the weight of the drugs seized is a material discrepancy. The difference in the weight of the drugs meant that by the time the exhibits reached the chemist, its gross weight had increased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The evidence of PW7 shows that PW6 had used a non-calibrated weighing scale. We agreed with the learned prosecutor's submission that the difference in the gross weight as found by PW6 as opposed to the gross weight found by PW2 is due to the non-calibrated weighing scale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In any event, as observed by Raus Sharif PCA in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_285;"><i>Loh Kah Loon v. PP</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 285</LINK>; [2011] 4 MLJ 260, at para 17 of p 288:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> According to the prosecution, <i>Loh Kah Loon (supra)</i> was referred to (and affirmed) by the Federal Court in its recent decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_1;"><i>Hasbala Mohd Sarong v. PP</i> [2013] 6 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2013] 6 MLJ 636; [2013] 6 CLJ 945; [2013] 6 AMR 324.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In this case, PW6 and PW7 confirmed and identified all the exhibits. The drugs identified were those drugs found in exhs P57 and PW6 took into possession those drugs from the appellant at the store. The exhibits were subsequently marked by both PW6 and PW7 before they were handed over to PW2 for chemical analysis. The same exhibits were returned to PW 7 and kept in his safe keeping pending disposal of the trial. Applying <i>Loh Kah Loon (supra)</i>, we have no doubt that, based on the evidence adduced, the drug exhibits seized and handed to PW7 and examined by PW2 were the same drug exhibits that were produced before the High Court and upon which the appellant was charged. There was no break in the chain of evidence that could have created a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the drugs exhibit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>4. Whether The Appellant's Defence Of Innocent Carrier Had Been Sufficiently Considered?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the learned Judicial Commissioner failed to direct his mind to the appellant's defence that he was an innocent carrier. In deliberating the defence of being framed, the learned trial judge was merely speculating and did not produce any facts to back his conjecture. Learned counsel relied on these authorities <i>viz</i>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_2_654;"><i>Nur Azmi So'aib v. PP</i> [2011] 2 MLRA 654</LINK>; [2013] 1 CLJ 563, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_4_322;"><i>Nik Asmawi Nik Daud v. PP</i> [2009] 4 MLRA 322</LINK>; [2010] 5 MLJ 652; [2010] 6 CLJ 400 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_425;"><i>Mohd Johi Said &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 425</LINK>; [2005] 1 CLJ 389; [2004] 6 AMR 825, in support of his contention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the present case, the appellant gave evidence on oath. He gave evidence that he was not the registered owner of the car and the car belonged to his brother, Ong Keng Loon. At the material time he was asked by his sister to get the motorcar from Ong Keng Loon. The appellant went just short of the border and met his brother at Bukit Kayu Hitam duty free shop. Having taken the motorcar, his brother directed the appellant to wait for him at the Immigration check point as he needed to collect some items from his girlfriend. It was his brother who left behind the bag in the motorcar. The appellant denied having knowledge of the bag's contents and he was merely an innocent carrier for Ong Keng Loon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner after going through in detail the defence's story concluded as follows:</p>
    <p>"[27] Saya perlu pertimbangkan samada pembelaan OKT boleh diterima atau tidak dan dipercayai atau sebalikanya. Pembelaan OKT menimbulkan beliau telah dianiaya oleh abangnya, Ong Keng Loon. Pembelaan ini jika diterima dan dipercayai <b>akan menimbulkan keraguan bukan sahaja tentang pengetahuan OKT mengenai dadah yang terdapat dalam beg</b> tersebut malah kawalan dan jagaan OKT terhadap dadah berbahaya itu sendiri. Sebaliknya jika pembelaan beliau dipercayai saya masih perlu pertimbangkan di dalam keadaan manakah pembelaan ini telah menimbulkan keraguan yang munasabah terhadap kes pendakwaan. Selepas mempertimbangkan pembelaan OKT tentang pemilikan dadah, saya mendapati pembelaan ini tidak boleh dipercayai. Adalah tidak munasabah untuk abang beliau mengenakan beliau sehingga menyebabkan beliau dikenakan pertuduhan dengan satu kesalahan yang berat. Kita perlu ingat pertuduhan terhadap OKT membawa hukuman mati mandatori dan agak tidak logik abang OKT, Ong Loon sanggup mengenakan beliau dengan kesalahan sedemikian rupa. Pembelaan OKT ini tentang peranan abangnya menganiayai beliau tidak munasabah dan tidak boleh dipercayai malah tidak dapat menimbulkan keraguan munasabah terhadap kes pendakwa bahawa OKT mempunyai pemilikan ke atas dadah berbahaya tersebut. Walaupun OKT gagal menimbulkan keraguan yang munasabah terhadap pemilikan, OKT masih berhak dibebaskan jika pembelaan beliau dapat menyangkal anggapan statutori pengedaran dadah di bawah <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(i)</LINK> tersebut. Tugas ini adalah pada tahap di atas imbangan kebarangkalian. Keterangan pembelaan tidak merujuk secara khusus penyangkalan anggapan ini. Oleh yang demikian OKT bergantung kepada pembelaan yang sama untuk menyangkal anggapan statutori ini. Keseluruhan pembelaan OKT ini tidak lebih dari satu pembelaan yang diada-adakan. Pembelaan sebegini di dalam keadaan biasa tidak akan menimbulkan keraguan yang munasabah terhadap kes pendakwaan."</p>

    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> In our view, although in this case no reference is made by the learned Judicial Commissioner to the term 'innocent carrier' in his written judgment it is clear from a perusal of his judgment above (in particular the emboldened part of the judgment) that the learned Judicial Commissioner had considered the appellant's defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Sufficient and credible evidence had been adduced to show that the appellant's conduct was consistent with the knowledge of the presence of drugs when he tried to avoid, pleaded for help and attempted continuously to bribe PW4 and PW5. We find that the appellant was not an innocent carrier and he knew all along that he was in the process of transporting the drugs from Thailand into Malaysia for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> From the totality of the evidence adduced we are satisfied and we agree with the finding of the learned Judicial Commissioner that there is ample evidence to support the necessary inference that the appellant had the control and custody of the drugs. The appellant had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> nor has he succeeded in raising any reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> It is our view that the conviction was safe and proper.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal and affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>
