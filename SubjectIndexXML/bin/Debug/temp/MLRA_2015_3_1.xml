    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent had driven in Mild Sheet Piles ("piles") for a third party company ("the company") in respect of a project on a piece of land ("the land"). The project was later abandoned and the company wound up. The respondent attempted to remove the piles on the land but was refused access by the landowner. The land was subsequently sold to the appellant by a public auction. The respondent tried once again to remove the piles but on 3 August 2012, the appellant refused the respondent access to the land to remove the piles. The respondent thus filed an action for, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that the piles that it had driven into the land were not fixtures to the said land and belonged to it. After the completion of the trial and the recording of evidence, the appellant filed an application to amend its defence to include a plea of limitation. The trial judge dismissed the application and allowed the respondent's action. The appellant appealed against the dismissal of its application and the judgment in favour of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeals with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The trial judge had not erred in the exercise of his discretion in dismissing the application to amend the defence. There was no reason for the Court of Appeal to intervene as the trial judge's discretion was exercised on correct principles. Further, the amendment being sought by the appellant to include a plea of limitation would be useless and non-effectual. (paras 2-3)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, limitation had not set in. The act of refusing the respondent access to the piles accrued from the date of refusal by the appellant to release the piles to the respondent, ie on 3 August 2012. The proposed amendment was also without basis as the act of refusing the respondent to take possession of the piles which were not affixed on to the land was a cause of action between the respondent and the appellant and limitation had not set in as it accrued in 2012. (para 5)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> As long as the piles could be removed without damaging the said land and were brought in purely for the purpose of the contract, the piles were not to be regarded in law as fixtures. (para 8)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The burden of proving that the piles were no longer chattels but fixtures on the said land was on the appellant. The appellant however elected to submit no case to answer at the close of the respondent's case. The respondent's evidence was thus accepted as correct, and the respondent had discharged its burden of proving the same were chattels. The judge was thus correct in finding for the respondent.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JHC:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was an appeal from the decision of the learned judge in dismissing the application of the appellant in (D-02(IM)(NCVC)-616-04-2014) to amend its defence after the completion of the trial and recording of evidence to include a plea of limitation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We found the learned judge had not erred in the exercise of his discretion in dismissing the said application. The learned judge had given due consideration to the application and the affidavit in support and found the following reasons for the dismissing the application, ie:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We are the view that since the decision of the learned judge was an exercise of discretion, we find no reason to intervene as the discretion was exercised on correct principles. The amendment being sought to include a plea of limitation would be useless and non-effectual. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1959_1_564;"><i>Ponnusamy &amp; Anor v. Nathu Ram</i> [1959] 1 MLRH 564</LINK>; [1959] MLJ 228)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> For the aforesaid reasons, we dismissed the appellant's appeal and reserved costs to be determined in the appeal proper. As to the part of limitation, being a ground to allow that amendment, looking at (B9 of the Appeal Record), the proposed plea of limitation is found therein. The claim of the respondent arises from the driving implanting of mild steel sheet piles ("MS Sheet Piles") in respect of a project for Syarikat Sedawan Properties (M) Sdn Bhd (a company in liquidation) on the said land. This project was abandoned and the respondent attempted to remove the MS Sheet Piles from the said land but the previous land owner had refused the respondent access to remove the MS Sheet Piles back. On the 3rd of August 2012, the present landowner, ie the appellant followed in the same vein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It is the judgment of this court that limitation had not set in as the act of refusing the respondent access to the MS Sheet Piles accrues from the date of refusal by the appellant to release the MS Sheet Piles to the respondent, ie (Appeal Record p 13 para 5 of the statement of claim). It is our view that the proposed amendment is without basis as the act of refusing the respondent to take possession of the MS Sheet Piles which were not affixed on to the land was a cause of action between the respondent and the appellant and limitation had not set in as it accrued in 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> With regards to the appeal proper in D-02(NCVC)(W)-998-06-2014, the order appealed against is found in (p 1 Rekod Rayuan Tambahan Bahagian A) and the grounds of judgment of the learned judge found in (p 3 to p 10 of the same volume of the Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondent was seeking a declaration that the mild steel sheet piles driven into lot 125 &amp; Lot 524 on the project site of Sendawan Properties Sdn Bhd was not a fixture to the said land and belonged to the respondent. The project had been abandoned and the contractor had been wound up. The appellant bought the said land at a public auction and contends that the MS Sheet Piles in question were fixtures to the said land and the respondent was not entitled to the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We agree with the learned judge, that as long as the mild steel sheet piles could be removed without damaging the said land and brought in purely for the purpose of the said contract, it will not be regarded in law as a fixture. (See <i>Billing v. Pill</i> [1953] 2 AER 1061 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_5_142;"><i>Esso Malaysia Bhd v. Hills Agency (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1993] 5 MLRH 142</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 740; [1993] 2 AMR 3525). We refer also to <i>National Land Code: A Commentary</i>, 2nd edn by Judith Sihombing at p 108 and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The burden of proving that the MS Sheet Piles were no longer chattels but fixtures on the said land was on the appellant. The appellant through its counsel elected to submit no case to answer at the close of the respondent's case (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_605;"><i>Jaafar Shaari &amp; Siti Jama Hashim v. Tan Lip Eng &amp; Anor</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 605</LINK>; [1997] 3 MLJ 693; [1997] 4 CLJ 509), a decision of the Supreme Court and we refer to the judgment of Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) at p 616 and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It therefore follows, the respondent's evidence is accepted as correct, and the respondent had discharged its burden of proving the same were chattels.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The respondent had adduced evidence both oral and documentary to prove its case. By electing to submit no case to answer, bearing in mind the burden that rests on the appellant, the learned judge was correct in finding for the respondent. We accordingly dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
