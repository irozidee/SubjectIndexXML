    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff was a public listed company with a subsidiary - Petra Energy Bhd ('PEB') - also a public listed company. PEB was the plaintiff's jewel in the crown that contributed an income of approximately RM2.34m annually to the plaintiff. The 1st to 3rd defendants were the plaintiff's previous directors and also directors of PEB. Due to the poor financial situation of the plaintiff, the 1st to 3rd defendants decided to take certain commercial directions to ease the financial difficulties the plaintiff faced. At an extraordinary general meeting ('EGM'), the shareholders of the plaintiff resolved, amongst others, that a general mandate ('the shareholders' divestment mandate') be given to the defendants to divest up to 19.5 million shares (equivalent to 10%) in PEB. The plaintiff took issue with regards to the Second and Third Divestments. The plaintiff, claimed that: (a) in causing the plaintiff to undertake the Second Divestment and the Third Divestment, the 1st to 3rd defendants had acted in breach of their statutory duties as set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the companies Act 1965 (CA)</LINK>; (b) further and/or in the alternative, the 2nd and 3rd defendants had dishonestly assisted the 1st defendant in the various breaches of duty owed by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff, and were accessories thereto; (c) further and/ or in the alternative, the 4th defendant as director of PEB, had dishonestly assisted the 1st to 3rd defendants in the various breaches of duty owed by the 1st to 3rd defendants to the plaintiff, and was accessory thereto; (d) the 1st to 4th defendants had conspired, whether by lawful and/or unlawful means, to injure the plaintiff vide the Second Divestment and the Third Divestment; and (e) as a result of the aforesaid acts or omissions, the plaintiff had suffered loss and damage in relation to both the Second Divestment and the Third Divestment. The High Court judge dismissed the plaintiff's claim against the defendants. Hence, the plaintiff appealed. A cross-appeal was also filed by the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants with costs; dismissing appeal against 4th defendant; dismissing 1st defendant's cross-appeal with costs)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The general principle is where matters are entrusted by the articles to the directors, it is not a matter where shareholders can intervene. However, this position has been varied by legislation, as for instance <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK>. Under certain given circumstances, shareholders would be empowered to seek that a decision of the board be made justiciable when it was just to do so. Whilst the unfettered powers of the directors were encompassed in art 115 of the plaintiff's Articles of Association, the shareholders' mandate at the EGM provided a barometer as to what the shareholders gauge as being the best interest of the company. This would be relevant when the directors' conduct was put under the microscope to ascertain whether they had breached <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK>. (paras 18 &amp; 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> As been prescribed by the plaintiff's Articles of Association by virtue of art 115 the terms that were provided by the Shareholders' Mandate during the EGM were the regulations that had been prescribed by passing resolutions. Thus the directors had to comply with the mandate as prescribed by the company's articles of association. The alleged board's mandate could not override the specific authority of the shareholders' mandate. (paras 25, 26 &amp; 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Despite the terms and conditions imposed under the board mandate, there was no intention to conduct a sale en bloc. The intention was to divest only a substantial portion of shares to Shorefield Resources. The defendants never intended to adhere to the interest of the shareholders and the party who benefited was Shorefield Resources (a company controlled by Datuk Bustari Yusof who was related to the 1st defendant by marriage). All these arrangements were put into place not for the purposes of improving the liquidity of the plaintiff but instead, it was an elaborate scheme to ensure that Shorefield Resources acquired a controlling interest of PEB, coming at a time when PEB had been given a lucrative new contract. Thus, there was a breach of duty on the part of the board of directors in allowing the controlling interest of the plaintiff in PEB to be virtually stripped and the benefit passed on to Shorefield Resources. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> As the 2nd and 3rd defendants were the directors of the plaintiff as at the Third Divestment, liability would be imputed on them being in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK>. (para 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> As a matter of law, directors are required to take into account the shareholders' view. Therefore any sale of more than the 10% mandated by the shareholders, especially a sale which results in PEB no longer being a subsidiary or the plaintiff losing its status as the single largest and controlling shareholder would have required shareholders' approval, which they failed to do. (para 45)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> With regards to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK> it is settled law that the duty to act honestly required by statute includes the duty to act in the best interest of the company. The test which the court has applied in determining whether directors have acted in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK> is an objective one, in that in the absence of separate consideration whether an honest and intelligent man in the position of a director of a company concern could, in the whole of material circumstances have reasonably believed that the transaction was for the benefit of the company. (para 46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The trial judge should have examined the conduct of the board of directors to determine whether they had satisfied the duty imposed on them in law. The board of the directors had failed to: (i) consider and take into account that the Second and Third Divestment of shares in PEB which led to the plaintiff ceasing to be the majority shareholder of PEB; and (ii) weigh the need to raise funds by the sale of the PEB shares would not improve the liquidity position of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had lost a valuable investment in PEB as the plaintiff no longer controlled PEB. At the end of the day, the beneficiary of the scheme referred to the aforesaid was Shorefield Resources which was linked to the 1st defendant through Dato' Bustari. These were factors that should have been considered by the court before it could hold that all these were done in the best interest of the plaintiff. The failure to do so, constituted a misdirection in law which warranted appellate intervention. (para 47)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal arises from a decision of the High Court Kuala Lumpur on 21st of March 2014, dismissing the appellant's claim against the respondents. The appellant filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal on the 18th of April 2014 and a cross-appeal was filed on the 19th of June 2014.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The facts material to this appeal are now set out below. For purposes of convenience, in this judgment we will refer to the appellant as the plaintiff and for the respondents as the defendants in their respective numbers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts Germane To This Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiff is a public listed company. Petra Energy Berhad ("PEB") is also a public listed company and was a subsidiary of the plaintiff. PEB was the "jewel in the crown" of the plaintiff contributing an income of approximately RM2.34 million annually (cash flow as in the Board Mandate on 18 November 2009) to the plaintiff (a fact not in dispute). Due to the financial situation of the plaintiff, ie repayment to bond holders or/and restrictive cash flow, the directors of the plaintiff (1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants) decided to take certain commercial measures to ease the financial difficulties the plaintiff faced. The only marketable asset that the plaintiff could use to raise funds was its shares in PEB. As PEB was pivotal for the income base of the plaintiff and any disposal of the shares of PEB would have a material effect on the financial position of the plaintiff, the directors decided to put their proposals to an EGM of shareholders for the said shareholders' approval.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Prior to its listing, PEB was a wholly owned subsidiary of the plaintiff. The 1st to 3rd defendants (now referred to as "board of directors") were the previous directors of the plaintiff (up to the time of the Third Divestment), and were also the directors of PEB. The 4th defendant was the executive director of PEB and had resigned as a director of PEB sometime on or around 18 June 2010. (See p 356 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 1(2) Bahagian A).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Pursuant to an extraordinary general meeting ("EGM") convened on 26 February 2007, the shareholders of the plaintiff resolved amongst others that a general mandate be given to the plaintiff to divest up to 19.5 million shares (equivalent to 10%) in PEB after its listing on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia (see pp 2172-2173 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(9) Bahagian C).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The Shareholders' Divestment Mandate was subject to an announcement by the plaintiff to Bursa Malaysia on 26 February 2007. This Shareholders' Divestment Mandate was also renewed on an annual basis by the shareholders of the plaintiff in general meetings and such renewals were also the subject matter of various announcements by the plaintiff to Bursa Malaysia (see pp 2174-2178 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(9) Bahagian C).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On or about 10 December 2007, the plaintiff, through its board of directors divested 9 million ordinary shares which it held in PEB to Lembaga Tabung Haji ("First Divestment"). The plaintiff's shareholding in PEB was reduced from 64.62% to 60% by reason of this divestment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> At a board of directors' meeting on or about 26 August 2009, the board of directors of the plaintiff resolved to divest further the plaintiff's shares in PEB to meet the cash requirements of the plaintiff's group and authorised the 1st defendant to negotiate and finalise the price and sale of such shares. (See pp 2795-2801 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(12) Bahagian C).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It was pursuant to the Second Divestment that the plaintiff divested 10.5 million ordinary shares in PEB to TA First Credit on 10 September 2009 ("Second Divestment") on the terms negotiated by the 1st defendant. (See p 2807 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(12) Bahagian C). The plaintiff's shareholding in PEB was reduced further to 54.62% by reason of this divestment. TA First Credit had in turn disposed of these shares under the Second Divestment to a company known as Shorefield Resources Sdn Bhd ("Shorefield Resources"). Shorefield Resources is and was controlled by Datuk Bustari Yusof who is related to the 1st defendant by marriage (see p 1340 Notes of Proceedings dated 23 January 2013).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> At a board of directors' meeting of the plaintiff that was convened on 18 November 2009, it was resolved that the plaintiff divests its remaining 54.62% shareholding in PEB to meet the plaintiff's cash flow requirements upon terms which included as follows (Third Divestment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 22 December 2009 ("December Board Meeting"), the board of directors resolved that 29.59% shareholding in PEB be disposed of in two tranches (Fourth Divestment). However this divestment was never proceeded with as an injunction was obtained by Encik Shamsul bin Saad (a shareholder, as well as an executive director of the plaintiff) to restrain dealings with the said shares. (See p 569 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 1(3) Bahagian A).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The resolution of the shareholders passed at the EGM dated 26 April 2007 remains in effect and has been renewed on 26 June 2008 and 25 June 2009. (See pp 103-117 Ikatan Teras Bersama (Ikatan Dokumen) Jilid 1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiff's Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The plaintiff takes issue with regards to the two particular divestments of the plaintiff's shares in PEB, ie the Second and Third Divestments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In this regard, the plaintiff contends that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Defendants' Reply</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The defence of the 1st to 3rd defendants is that they did, in authorising and effecting the two impugned divestments of shares in PEB, had acted at all material times pursuant to the mandates of the board of directors collectively arrived at in August and November 2009. They maintain that they did, at all times act <i>bona fide</i> in the interests of the plaintiff when effecting such divestments which were duly authorised by the board. In essence they point to the fact that the dominant purpose of such divestments was to meet the urgent liquidity needs of the plaintiff and to assuage its dire cash flow position because:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The 1st to 3rd defendants maintain that they duly discharged their fiduciary and statutory duties as directors of the plaintiff with regards to these disputed divestments. They point to the fact that they relied on professional advisors in carrying out these transactions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> As for the plea of conspiracy, the 1st to 3rd defendants and the 4th defendant deny the same absolutely, maintaining that there was never at any point of time any agreement arrived at between them and/or others to injure the plaintiff. They deny the existence of any scheme designed to injure the plaintiff by causing the divestment of its 'crown jewel', namely PEB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issues To Be Dealt By The Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The company is made up of two main components, ie the board of directors and members in general meeting. The general principle is where matters are entrusted by the Articles to the directors, it is not a matter where shareholders can intervene. The effect of the demarcation of powers between the board of directors and members in general meeting has been well illustrated in the case of <i>Automatic Self Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Limited v. Cunninghame</i> [1906] 2 Ch 34. There, the articles of the company expressedly empowered the directors to sell any property of the company on such terms and conditions as they might think fit. A resolution was passed by the company directing the board to sell the company's property to a new company formed for that purpose. It was held that the directors were not bound to carry into effect the resolution passed by the general meeting. The Court of Appeal was urged to use the analogy of principal and agent, in that it would be an absurd thing if a principal in appointing an agent should in effect appoint a dictator who is to manage him, instead of his managing the agent. The argument was rejected by Collins MR, where the Master of the Rolls stated that such an analogy did not strictly apply to that case, and added:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The main reason for the division of powers between directors and members was explained by Buckley LJ in Gramophone and <i>Typewriter Ltd v. Stanley</i> [1908] 2 KB 89, at p 105-6 in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> However the classical position as set out above has been varied by legislation, for instance s <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">132(1) of the CA</LINK>; and it is our view that under certain given circumstances the shareholders would be empowered to seek that the decision of the board be made justiciable when it was just to do so. In this case it is not the resolution of the board or the members in the EGM which is being challenged per se but the conduct of the directors in acting the way that they did in flagrant breach of the members' resolution and whether this constituted a breach under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK>. In <i>Australian Growth Resources Corp Pty Ltd v. Van Reesema</i> [1988] 13 ACLR 261, the South Australian Supreme Court in considering the Australian equivalent to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132</LINK>, held that the statutory duty to act honestly encompassed in it the fiduciary duties of acting in the interests of the company and to act for proper purposes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The main argument by the plaintiff in that Australian case was that the Shareholders' Mandate prevails over the Board's Mandate. Article 115(1) of the plaintiff's Articles of Association in the instant appeal provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned High Court Judge ruled (at p 232 of the Rekod Rayuan) that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Whilst the unfettered powers of the directors is encompassed in art 115, it is our view that that the shareholder's mandate at the EGM provides a barometer as to what the shareholders gauge as being the best interest of the company. This would be relevant when the directors' conduct is put under the microscope to ascertain whether they had breached <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The plaintiff had referred to us the case of <i>Credit Development Pte Ltd v. IMO Pte Ltd</i> [1993]1 2 SLR 370 where the shareholder of the plaintiff company sent written requisitions to the plaintiff setting out seven resolutions it wanted moved at the next annual general meeting of the plaintiff. The plaintiff however, declined to include the resolutions in the agenda of the next annual general meeting on the basis that the matters in the resolutions came within the purview of the directors and a general meeting was not the proper forum to deliberate on them. Article 88(1) of the Articles of Association of the company, is almost identical with art 115(1) of the plaintiff's Articles of Association. The learned judge, Lim Teong Qwee JC had at pp 377 and 378 of the report stated that and we agree:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The abovementioned case had distinguished the cases referred to by the learned trial judge in our instant appeal wherein the cases must be read in the context of the articles of association of the company in question. The shareholders may by special resolution direct the directors to take or refrain from taking specified action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Based on the abovementioned case, the articles of association of a company are the regulations of the company. As been prescribed by the plaintiff's Articles of Association by virtue of art 115, ie "... being not inconsistent with the aforesaid regulations or provisions as may be prescribed by the company in general meeting", the terms that were provided by the Shareholders' Mandate during the EGM are the regulations that has been prescribed by passing resolutions and thus the directors must comply with the mandate as prescribed by the company's articles of association.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The Shareholders' Mandate was subsequently renewed by the shareholders during the plaintiff's annual general meeting held on 26 June 2008 and 25 June 2009 respectively. Therefore, the alleged Board's Mandate could not override the specific authority of the Shareholders' Mandate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The defendants on the other hand stated that the Shareholders' Divestment Mandate does not deprive the plaintiff's board of directors of its power to deal with the plaintiff's shares in PEB in accordance with the law and the plaintiff's Memorandum and Articles of Association.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> A valid resolution, ie the Shareholders' Mandate was given to the board of directors during the extraordinary general meeting of the plaintiff allowing the board of directors to dispose up to 10% shares held in PEB, upon the following terms ("Shareholders' Divestment Mandate"):</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>[29]</b> The rationale for the Shareholder's Divestment Mandate was to enable the plaintiff to effect the divestment of 19.5 million ordinary shares in PEB (representing 10% of PEB's shareholding) or any part thereof at the opportune time in the event of improving equity market conditions and to eliminate the need to convene separate general meetings whenever applicable to obtain shareholders' approval for the divestment of such shares. The Shareholders' Divestment Mandate would enable the plaintiff to raise additional funds expeditiously as and when it was required without having to obtain approval at a General Meeting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In this case the regulatory aspect of the same were the mode of selling and that the divesting of the plaintiff's shares in PEB would not exceed 10%. These regulations were made by way of extraordinary resolutions at the EGM, so they would constitute regulations under art 115 and we therefore are not in agreement with the learned judge on the point. In the case of <i>Marshall's Valve Gear Co Ltd v. Manning Wardle &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1908] 1 Ch 267, Justice Neville J took this approach (and we agree) and we quote at pp 268 and 273-274:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Despite the regulations set out by the shareholders in the mandate with regards to the discount in respect of the shares not exceeding 10% in the Second Divestment, the 1st defendant had caused 10.5 million ordinary PEB's shares at par value RM0.50 each to be transferred to TA First Credit who in turn on 27 October 2009 disposed of 9.7 million shares out of the 10.5 million ordinary shares of PEB shares at RM1.80 per share making a profit of approximately RM2,600,000.00 in favour of TA First Credit. The end buyer in the Second Divestment was Shorefield Resources. Bearing in mind that the purpose of this Second Divestment was to improve the liquidity position of the plaintiff, could it be then said disposing of PEB shares at par value under the Second Divestment, be acting in the best interest of the plaintiff taking into account the profit TA First Credit made in selling the said shares to Shorefield Resources?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In respect of the Third Divestment it was very clear that it had breached the mandate of the EGM in that the plaintiff's controlling interest in PEB would be completely divested despite the stipulation in the said mandate against such divestment. However by the board of directors meeting convened on 18 November 2009 it was resolved that the plaintiff divest its remaining 54.62% shareholding in PEB (see pp 142-160 Ikatan Teras Bersama (Ikatan Dokumen) Jilid 1). In this regard we find that the Third Divestment was not <i>bona fide</i> and/or in the best interest of the plaintiff as it was conducted by the directors in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK>, which must be examined based on the following facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The disposal of shares was not <i>bona fide</i> in the interest of the plaintiff and the series of emails between PW7 (agent of TA Securities) and the 1st defendant showed that they never intended to adhere the interest of the shareholders especially during the Third Divestment. The emails indicating this are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The emails showed that there was a concerted effort to divest PEB's shares to Dato' Bustari's company, ie Shorefield Resources. The board of directors, in particular the 1st defendant, in deciding to approve the Third Divestment and push it through, smacks of a case of impetuosity and a total disregard of relevant facts and in particular the divestment mandate. The board of directors had not acted <i>bona fide</i> in the interest of the plaintiff but were driven to take steps that place Shorefield Resources, the principal beneficiary of these arrangement. It appeared that strict terms were imposed so as to eliminate potential bidders and yet terms would be adjusted to favour Dato' Bustari.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It is clear that despite the terms and conditions imposed under the board mandate dated 18 November 2009, there was no intention to conduct a sale en bloc. The intention was to divest only a substantial portion of shares to Shorefield Resources. They have never intended to adhere to the interest of the shareholders and eventually the party who benefited was Dato' Bustari and Shorefield Resources. All these arrangements were put into place not for the purposes of improving the liquidity of the company of the plaintiff but instead it was an elaborate scheme to ensure that Shorefield Resources acquired a controlling interest of PEB, coming at a time when PEB had been given a lucrative new contract from Shell by Sarawak Shell Berhad and Sabah Shell Petroleum Company Ltd (see pp 64-66 1st respondent's Core Bundle). Thus there was a breach of duty on the part of the board of directors in allowing the controlling interest of the plaintiff in PEB to be virtually stripped and the benefit of it to be passed on to Shorefield Resources.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Furthermore, DW3, the Head of Corporate Finance in Affin Investment Bank Berhad, testified that he was not given the exact terms of the conditional mandate of the board dated 18 November 2009 (see p 1289 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(4) Bahagian C). He was told that the cash was required urgently (see pp 1282-1283 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(4) Bahagian C). He was also not informed that PEB shares were pledged and the amount of loan underlying thereto. The evidence of DW3 are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Whilst the evidence shows also a conspiracy between the board of directors and 6th and 7th defendants, to divest the plaintiff's shares in PEB to Shorefield Resources by causing it to become the single largest, majority and controlling shareholder of PEB, but as the present appeal is not being proceeded with against the 6th and 7th defendants, the matter rests there. We also find no evidence linking the 4th defendant in respect of the alleged conspiracy, and the ingredients of conspiracy had not been made out against the 4th defendant. And we are therefore of the view that the appeal against the 4th defendant should be dismissed. To prove the act of conspiracy, there must be two or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. <i>Halsburys Laws of England</i> (4th edn) at para 1527, states that the essential ingredients of conspiracy are (1) an agreement between two or more persons, (2) an agreement for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, and (3) that acts done in execution of that agreement resulted in damage to the plaintiff. It is not enough that two or more persons pursued the same unlawful object at the same time or in the same place; it is necessary to show a meeting of minds, a consensus to effect an unlawful purpose though it is not necessary that each conspirator should have been in communications with each other (<i>11 Halsburys Laws</i> (4th edn) para 58).

Concrete Engineering Products Bhd &amp; Other Suits</i> [2001] 3 MLRH 609</LINK>; [2001] 2 MLJ 332; [2001] 8 CLJ 262; [2001] 2 AMR 2151 the learned judge James CY Foong J (as he then was) held at p 638 as follows:</p>

    <p>Wan Suleiman FJ in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_66;"><i>Mrs Kok Wee Kiat v. Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Berhad &amp; Ors</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 66</LINK>; [1979] 1 MLJ 71 define conspiracy as "A conspiracy consists ... in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> For the reasons in law and on the facts stated above, the appeal against the 4th defendant should stand dismissed. As for the appeals against the 2nd and 3rd defendants as they were the directors of the plaintiff as at the Third Divestment, liability would be imputed on them being in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK> and it would follow that the appeals against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants would be allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The board of directors contended that they have properly exercised their duties and have acted in its best interest to the company. They had addressed their mind to <i>inter alia</i> the following matters in coming to a decision to dispose substantially the plaintiff's shareholding in PEB in:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The question to be asked and should have been asked by the learned trial judge was whether the Second and Third Divestment was in the best interest of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's shares in PEB has been reduced to 29.59% from 54.62% after the Third Divestment thus ceased to be the single largest and controlling shareholder of PEB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The learned High Court Judge had concluded that the Second and Third Divestments were in fact effected or transacted for a proper purpose and there's no breach of fiduciary duties by the defendants, ie <i>bona fide</i> in the best interests of the plaintiff (at p 222 of the Rekod Rayuan):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> What is the meaning of the phrase '<i>bona fide</i> for the benefit as a whole'? The (then) Supreme Court had occasioned to observe on the meaning of '<i>bona fide</i> for the benefit of a company as a whole in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1973_1_512;"><i>Paidiah Genganaidu v. The Lower Perak Syndicate Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1973] 1 MLRA 512</LINK>; [1974] 1 MLJ 220. Ali FJ, delivering the judgment of the court said, at p 514:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In <i>Industrial Concrete Products Bhd v. Concrete Engineering Products Bhd &amp; Other Suits (supra)</i> where Justice James Foong J (as he then was) at p 630 sets out the primary duty of a director:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Both of the cases cited above clearly state that 'for the best interest of a company' is for a majority to decide and also proper consideration of relevant facts in which a director must take into account to promote and advance the interest of the company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> As a matter of law, a director is required to take into account the shareholders' view. Therefore any sale of more than the 10% mandated by the shareholders especially a sale which results in PEB no longer being a subsidiary or the plaintiff losing its status as the single largest and controlling shareholder would have required shareholders' approval, which they failed to do. The learned High Court Judge at p 143 of the Rekod Rayuan stated that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> With regards to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK> it is settled law that the duty to act honestly required by statute includes the duty to act in the best interest of the company. The test which the court has applied in determining whether directors have acted in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;132.;;">s 132(1) of the CA</LINK> is an objective one, in that in the absence of separate consideration "whether an honest and intelligent man in position of a director of a company concern could, in the whole of material circumstances have reasonably believed that the transaction was for the benefit of the company". We refer to the case <i>Intraco Ltd v. Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd</i> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064, at pp 1077 to 1078 where it set out the test to "act in the best interest of the company":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In our present case, the learned judge should have examined the conduct of the board of directors to determine whether they had satisfied the duty imposed on them in law in terms of their conduct that has been referred to in this case. We are of the view that the board of the directors had failed to give consideration to the following facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In our view, these are the factors that should have been considered by the court before it could hold that all these were done in the best interest of the plaintiff. To our mind, failure to do so constitutes a misdirection in law and fact on the part of the learned trial judge which warrants appellate intervention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> We have given due consideration to the cross-appeal of the 1st defendant and we are in agreement with the learned trial judge and the view expressed in para 491 of her Grounds of Judgment at p 223. We therefore accordingly dismissed the cross-appeal with costs.</p>
