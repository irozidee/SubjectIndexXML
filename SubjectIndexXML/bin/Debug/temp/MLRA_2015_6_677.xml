    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>In this appeal, leave was granted to the appellant to appeal against the concurrent findings of the courts below on the following questions of law: (1) whether as a matter of law, the elements of a loan exist where at the request of a person, payment of money was made by the payer to a third party; and (2) whether a court, having regard to the principle established in <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i>, and having admitted evidence on an unpleaded point was entitled to reject that evidence by reference to the fact that it was not pleaded. In this case, the appellant had accepted an offer from the respondent, a stock broking firm, to open a share trading account. Following that, the appellant executed an undated individual account application form and an undated Margin Facility Agreement ('MFA'). Thereafter, the respondent granted a Margin Trading Facility ('MTF') to the appellant. By its statement of claim, the respondent claimed from the appellant a sum being alleged as contra losses on share transactions. The appellant denied executing the MFA, being granted the MTF, or trading in share transactions under the said margin account. Alternatively, the appellant pleaded that he instructed the respondent to dispose of a certain number of shares that he had pledged to the respondent, which, if disposed, it was averred, would have been sufficient to cover any alleged debt. However, during trial the appellant raised an unpleaded defence, ie that the sale of the shares was for the repayment of a 'loan' of RM8 million which was deposited into the account of Cempaka Holdings Sdn Bhd ('Cempaka'), rather than a margin trading.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (unanimously dismissing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The word 'loan' in this case was not a variation, modification or development but a radical departure from the pleaded case. Hence, <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i> could not apply. A court may act on ex facie illegality in the absence of a plea, but other than <i>ex facie</i> illegality, any radical departure from the pleaded case must be pleaded, to avoid surprise at the trial. Illegality on the face of it was not made out. Therefore, 'loan', which was not pleaded and which was a radical departure from the pleaded defence, should not have been allowed to be proved at the trial. (<i>Merong Mahawangsa Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Dato' Shazryl Eskay Abdullah (refd)</i>). (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In this case, evidence of the 'loan' was not rejected by the trial judge "by reference to the fact that it was not pleaded". 'Loan' was rejected by reference to the fact that it was not credible. Hence, leave question (2) was premised on a misconception of the findings of the trial judge. Since the factual gravamen was absent, it would be wholly idle to answer leave question (2). (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The facts asserted in leave question (1) assumed that it was the respondent who deposited the RM8 million into the account of Cempaka. However, there was no finding by the courts below that it was the respondent who did so. Rather, the finding of the trial judge was that there was no evidence to show that the RM8 million was in fact credited into the account of Cempaka by the respondent by way of a loan. Thus, the finding of the trial judge was that it was margin trading and not a loan. The trial judge gave umpteen reasons for those findings which were based on solid evidence and should not be lightly disturbed by an appellate court. In this instance, 'loan' was clearly an afterthought. The only evidence that was certain was that it was margin trading. Consequently as it was a margin trading and not a loan, leave question (1) could not be answered. (para 17)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Leave was granted to the appellant/defendant to appeal against the concurrent findings of the courts below on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts could be summarised as follows. On 4 September 1997, the respondent/plaintiff, a stock broking firm, issued an offer to the appellant to open a share trading account. The appellant accepted that offer and executed an undated individual account application form and an undated Margin Facility Agreement (MFA). Thereafter, the respondent granted a Margin Trading Facility (MTF) of up to a limit of RM10m to the appellant to enable the appellant to trade on securities listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. For the purpose of his share trading transactions, the appellant maintained a margin account no HA600/DLH.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> By its statement of claim dated 28 November 2007, the respondent claimed from the appellant the sum of RM12,658,779.00, it being alleged contra losses on share transactions as at 18 April 2005, and interest on the sum of RM5,997,788.53 at the rate of 13.5% per annum calculated on a daily basis from 19 April 2005. In his statement of defence, the appellant denied that he executed the said MFA, that he was granted the said MTF, or that he traded in share transactions under the said margin account. Alternatively, the appellant pleaded that he instructed the respondent to dispose of 15,939,000 shares in Wembley Industries Holding Berhad that he had pledged to the respondent in 1998, which, if disposed, it was averred, would have been sufficient to cover any alleged debt. Limitation was also raised as a defence, but both the High Court and Court of Appeal held, in the application of the appellant to strike out the claim and in the appeal therefrom, that the action was not time-barred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Hence, when trial commenced, the pleaded defence consisted of a denial of the margin account and share transactions, and an assertion that the pledged shares, if disposed, would have been sufficient to settle the margin losses. But an unpleaded defence, one which changed the character of the pleaded defence, was raised by the appellant during the trial. The unpleaded defence was first raised by the learned counsel for the appellant during his cross-examination of PW1. After an exhaustive examination on all conceivable matters that could have had to do with the margin account (see 167-211AR), the learned counsel for the appellant suggested to PW1, who disagreed, "that Dato' Hamzah had deposited 15m Wembley shares with instructions to Omega to sell the shares at the very onset to repay the loan [of RM8m] and return the surplus to him".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The transcript is not clear as to when the learned counsel for the respondent first challenged the suggestion that it was a loan and not margin trading. But at 219AR, that is, during the reexamination of PW1, there ensued the following exchange between learned trial judge and the counsel.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Therefore, between the parties, it was agreed, with the concurrence of the learned trial judge, to put whatever objection to any unpleaded defence on the back burner, to be taken up only at the stage of submissions at the close of the entire case. But even so, the learned counsel for the respondent perspicaciously elicited an answer from PW1 that it was not a moneylending transaction (see p 223 of the Appeal Record). PW2 was not cross-examined on the alleged loan. Meantime, in his witness statement (335-343AR), the appellant had affirmed that he applied to the respondent for a loan of RM7 to 8m, that he deposited 15.9m Wembley shares with the respondent, that a sum of RM8m was deposited into his account [the appellant would later testify that it was actually deposited into the account of Cempaka Holdings Sdn Bhd (Cempaka), where he was a Director and Shareholder], and that the respondent would sell those shares to settle the loan and refund any surplus to him. The appellant denied all knowledge of his execution of the MFA, MTF or other documents produced by the respondent. The appellant also denied receipt of the monthly statements of accounts from the respondent. Under examination-in-chief, the appellant reaffirmed that it was a loan and not margin trading. Under cross-examination, the appellant agreed that 'loan' was not pleaded in his defence (see 273AR). At the close of the entire case, the learned trial judge directed parties to file written submissions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In his written submission to the learned trial judge, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted, with respect to the alleged loan, as follows. 'Loan' was not pleaded in the defence. No application was made to amend the defence. 'Loan' was not averred to in the application to strike out the claim. The appellant contended that the loan sum of RM8m was disbursed to the account of Cempaka. "No evidence was produced to prove that RM8m was indeed transferred into the account. When he was questioned about whether or not the auditors of Cempaka queried him as to how the RM8m allegedly came into the account, DW1 merely said that he cannot recall as it was such a long time ago ... Even if RM8m was indeed deposited after the defendant had pledged shares to the plaintiff, it does not prove that ... there was a loan. The shares were pledged for the Margin Facility that the plaintiff granted to the defendant". The appellant did not mention 'loan' when he met the respondent's liquidators. 'Loan' was not raised in the appellant's solicitors' first letter to the respondent. 'Loan' was an afterthought. 'Loan' was not raised in the defence or in the issues to be tried. Parties are bound by their pleadings (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_423;"><i>State Government Of Perak v. Muniandy</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 423</LINK>; [1986] 1 MLJ 490 was cited). If the appellant wanted a loan, he could have approached a bank. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;91.;;">Section 91 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> excludes oral evidence which varies or adds to the terms of a written contract. No document was produced to prove that it was the respondent who deposited RM8m into the account of Cempaka.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In response, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted to the learned trial judge as follows. Based on Based on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_738;"><i>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 738</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 331; [1995] 4 CLJ 283; [1995] 3 AMR 2871, where it was held by the Federal Court that it is the duty of the court to consider the evidence let in without objection on the unpleaded case of estoppel, it was too late for the respondent to object to the issue of 'loan'. Objection to 'loan' should be made at the first opportunity. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_213;"><i>Lim Kar Bee v. Duofortis Properties (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 213</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 281; [1992] 1 CLJ 173 it was held by the former Supreme Court that the court can take judicial notice of illegality where facts which have not been pleaded emerge in evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Before us, it was orally submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that evidence of 'loan' was admitted but then was rejected by the learned trial judge, and that the only rationale for the payment of RM8m into the account of Cempaka was loan against shares, and that the substance of the transaction was overlooked by the learned trial judge. The learned counsel for the appellant cited <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_226;"><i>KEP Mohamed Ali v. KEP Mohamed Ismail</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 226</LINK>; [1981] 2 MLJ 10, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_161;"><i>OCBC Ltd v. Philip Wee Kee Puan</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 161</LINK>; [1984] 2 MLJ 1; [1984] 1 CLJ 25 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_738;"><i>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 738</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 331; [1995] 4 CLJ 283; [1995] 3 AMR 2871 to support the argument that evidence of 'loan', since recorded, should have been considered, and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_754;"><i>Malayan Banking Bhd v. PK Rajamani</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 754</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 405; [1994] 2 CLJ 253; [1994] 1 AMR 10 to amplify that courts should look at the substance and not the label attached to the transaction. In his written submission, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted "it is submitted here that as payment by a third party to a lender is considered good payment, payment by a lender to a third party at the request of the borrower must also be considered good payment. The appellant relies on <i>Hirachand Punamchand v. Temple</i>".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The learned counsel for the respondent orally submitted that in order to succeed, the appellant must persuade this court to overturn the findings of the courts below, that there was no evidence that the respondent credited RM8m into the account of Cempaka or that Cempaka paid that sum to the appellant in order to substantiate the fact of 'loan', and that the share transactions were documented in 429-444AR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Leave question two suggested, as if it were fact, that the learned trial judge (i) did not follow <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i>, and (ii) admitted evidence on an unpleaded point but then rejected that evidence "by reference to the fact that it was not pleaded". But with respect, the learned trial judge had done nothing of that sort. In fact, the learned trial judge plainly applied <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i> (see para 6.2.1(iv) of the grounds of the learned trial judge) and admitted the evidence of the 'loan' (see para 6.2.1(v) of the grounds of the learned trial judge). But the learned trial judge held that 'loan' was an afterthought (see para 6.2.1(v) of the grounds of the learned trial judge) which was not proved on a balance of probabilities (see para 6.2.1(vii) of the grounds of the learned trial judge), and, that it was no 'loan' (see para 6.2.1(viii) of the grounds of the learned trial judge). 22 reasons and five sub-reasons were given by the learned trial judge for his finding that it was not a 'loan' (see 78-92AR). And being 'not pleaded' was not one of those reasons. It was absolutely untrue that evidence of 'loan' was rejected by the learned trial judge on the ground that it was not pleaded. The facts asserted in leave question two could not be further from the truth.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The irony of it all is that the learned trial judge should not have applied <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i>. In the latter case, in the final submission after the conclusion of all the evidence, an objection was raised for the first time by the plaintiffs that certain defences were not pleaded and ought to be disregarded under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;18.;;">O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. The former Supreme Court per Peh Swee Chin SCJ, later FCJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The former Supreme Court decreed that "it should be objected to as when and where it is adduced". But in the instant case, the respondent gave notice that it would object to the defence of 'loan' even before any evidence of 'loan' was adduced in court. In his witness statement, the appellant asserted that it was a 'loan'. But that witness statement must first be tendered and read at the hearing before it would become evidence-in-chief (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;35A.;;">O 35A of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>). Evidence of 'loan' was only adduced when the appellant tendered and read his witness statement at the hearing. The earliest opportunity for the respondent to object was at the stage of cross-examination of the appellant. But even before evidence of 'loan' could be adduced, it was agreed between the parties, with the concurrence of the learned trial judge, to only raise whatever issue on the unpleaded defence at the stage of submissions at the close of the entire case. Given so, it was not right to fault the respondent for raising the objection at the stage of submissions at the close of the entire case. And given further that the instant facts were so different, it was just not apposite to apply <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i>, where "the alleged defences were not a radical departure from what had been pleaded and was a mere development of it" (see <i>Singapore Civil Procedure 2015</i>, vol 1 at p 18/7/12).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It was also not proper to apply <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i> just because of the fact that the evidence was adduced without objection. For there is an important exception to the rule that evidence though not pleaded but if not objected to is admissible. At pp 303 to 304 of the report, that is immediately after the abovequoted passage, the former Supreme Court in <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i> instructed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> 'Loan' was not a variation, modification or development but a radical departure from the pleaded case. Hence, <i>Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys 4th Division &amp; Anor v. Hamit B Matusin &amp; Ors</i> could not apply. "If the contract does not appear to be illegal on its face evidence of circumstances showing that it an illegal object will not be admitted unless those circumstances are pleaded" (<i>Civil Practice in Singapore and Malaysia</i> vol 1 by Jeffrey Pinsler at p 627). A court may act on ex facie illegality in the absence of a plea (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_5_377;">Merong Mahawangsa Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Dato' Shazryl Eskay Abdullah [2015] 5 MLRA 377</LINK>). But other than <i>ex facie</i> illegality, any radical departure from the pleaded case must be pleaded, to avoid surprise at the trial. Illegality on the face of it was not made out. Therefore, 'loan', which was not pleaded and which was a radical departure from the pleaded defence, should not have been allowed to be proved at the trial (see <i>Singapore Civil Procedure 2015</i>, vol 1 at p 18/8/2).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Be that as it may and in any event, evidence of 'loan' was not rejected by the learned trial judge "by reference to the fact that it was not pleaded". 'Loan' was rejected by reference to the fact that it was not credible. Leave question two was premised on a misconception of the findings of the learned trial judge. Since the factual gravamen was absent, it would be wholly idle to answer leave question two, for whatever answer could not produce a result that could decide it for the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The facts were also not there for leave question one to be posed. The facts asserted in leave question one read "where at the request of a person, payment is made by the payor to a third party ...". Quite plainly, those asserted facts assumed as a given that it was the respondent who deposited the said RM8m into the account of Cempaka. But there was no finding by the courts below that it was the respondent who deposited RM8m into the account of Cempaka. Rather, the finding of the learned trial judge was that "there is no evidence to show that the sum of RM7,953,750 was in fact credited into the account of [Cempaka] by the [appellant] by way of a loan" (see para 6.2.1(vii)(e) of the grounds of the learned trial judge). Even the appellant admitted at 301-302AR that he had no evidence that it was the respondent who deposited that sum into the account of Cempaka. The finding of the learned trial judge was that it was margin trading and not a loan. As said, the learned trial judge gave umpteen reasons for those findings. And those findings, which were based on solid evidence, namely individual account application, margin facility agreement, contra notes, contra statements, monthly statements, margin financing reports, client's history transactions, and, summary of share transactions (see 422- 453AR), should not be lightly disturbed by an appellate court. The appellant contended that margin trading was a sham. But 'loan' was not raised by the appellant in his correspondence, in his defence, in his application to strike out the claim, or by him at any one occasion before trial. We wholly agree with the courts below that 'loan' was clearly an afterthought. The pay-in slip mustered by the appellant was evidence of some deposit into the account of Cempaka. But that pay-in slip was not evidence that it was the respondent who paid that sum into the account of Cempaka. The only evidence that was certain was that it was margin trading. Given that we agree with the finding of margin trading and that it was not a loan, we could not answer leave question one.</p>

      <b>[18]</b> In the premises of the aforesaid, we, the remaining judges (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;78.;;">s 78 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>), following the resignation of Mohamed Apandi Ali FCJ, as he then was, now AG, unanimously dismiss this appeal with costs.</p>
