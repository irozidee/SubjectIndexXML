    <p>The appellant had let the ground floor of its building ("the premises") to the respondents under a tenancy agreement dated 11 May 1992. The three-year tenancy commenced on 1 June 1992 with an option to renew for a further two years from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1997. The respondents exercised the option to renew and thus, the tenancy would expire on 31 March 1997. A few months before the expiry, the appellant indicated to the respondents that it was prepared to grant a new tenancy to the respondents for three years at RM4,500 per month. The parties could not agree on the new rental and hence, no new tenancy agreement was entered into between the parties after 31 March 1997, but the respondents continued to occupy the premises. On 6 May 1997, the appellant filed a claim for payment of double rental at the Magistrates' Court but which claim was transferred to the High Court ("the appellant's action"). The appellant subsequently filed an application for interim payments wherein by a consent order dated 1 December 1998, the High Court ordered the payment of RM2250 per month from April 1997 pending disposal of the action. The appellant thereafter applied for vacant possession of the premises and on 1 March 2004, the High Court ordered the respondents to quit and deliver vacant possession of the premises to the appellant. On 14 September 2005, the appellant applied for payment out to it of the sum of RM193,500 representing the agreed rental from April 1997 to June 2004 being the time when vacant possession was handed over. The High Court allowed the application for payment out on 12 July 2006. When the appellant's action finally came up for determination, the High Court decided the issue on the basis of <i>res judicata</i> and held that the issues raised had been previously litigated and determined - making reference to the orders of 1 December 1998 and 12 July 2006. The High Court further held that since the appellant had accepted the payment out, it must be deemed to have waived any sums for double rental. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The consent order made on 1 December 1998 related only to the interim payment of monthly rentals of RM2,250 per month pending the final disposal of the action. The consent order did not relate to or concern the issue whether the appellant was entitled to be paid double rental. The consent order was neither a final order in relation to the claim for double rental nor had it been made on the merits regarding the payment of double rental. The subsequent order for payment out dated 12 July 2006 related directly to the payment out of the interim rental and had nothing to do with issue of whether the appellant was entitled to be paid double rental. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> This court could not agree with the respondents' contention that because the appellant had not put forward its claim for double rental when it applied for the order of vacant possession, the appellant was barred by <i>res judicata</i> from relitigating the claim. When the appellant had filed the instant suit, it had sought for payment of double rental as one of its reliefs. The appellant had thus complied with the rule in <i>Henderson v. Henderson</i> that a litigant should put forward his whole case. There was nothing wrong with the appellant having made an interlocutory application for vacant possession whilst leaving the issue of double rental to go to trial. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant's claim for double rental having already been placed on record and waiting to be tried, there was no basis for the trial judge to find that the appellant had waived its claim for double rental. The claim for double rental was a claim recognised by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;28.;;">s 28(4)(a) of the Civil Law Act 1956 ('CA')</LINK>. The appellant's claim for double rental fell to be decided on the issue whether the respondents were holding over after the determination of their tenancy - a completely different issue from whether the appellant was entitled to obtain an interim payment of rental whilst awaiting the outcome of the case. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The order for vacant possession was not a final judgment. The order for vacant possession did not address or decide the question of whether the appellant was entitled to be paid double rental. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The appellant's claim for double rental and the appellant's application for interim payment of monthly rental were not claims which were alternative and mutually exclusive to the other. They were completely different claims - one was a payment for holding over whereas the other was a payment of rental, both of which a landlord would be entitled to claim if he could prove the factual circumstances permitting him to do so. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> There was sufficient evidence on record to find that the respondent's tenancy determined on 31 March 1997 by effluxion of time. Instead of delivering up vacant possession of the demised premises, the respondents continued to hold over after the determination of their tenancy. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;28.;;">Section 28(4)(a) of the CLA</LINK> thus came into play and the appellants were entitled to charge the respondents double the amount of the rental or double the value of the demised premises.

    <p>
      <b>Clement Skinner JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> We had earlier heard the appeal of YT Marketing Sdn Bhd ("the appellant") against the decision of the High Court Shah Alam dated the 8 August 2011. By its decision the High Court dismissed the appellant's claim for payment of double rental of premises owned by the appellant and occupied by Tan Whye Kion and Ong Bee Bee trading as Heads Unisex Saloon ("the respondents") as tenants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We allowed the appeal. These are our reasons for doing so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant is the registered owner of a four storey building at No 36, Lorong Gopeng, Klang. It let out the Ground Floor of the building (the demised premises) to the respondents under a Tenancy Agreement ("tenancy agreement") dated 11 May 1992.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The term of the tenancy of the demised premises was for three years commencing from 1 June 1992 and expiring on 31 March 1995.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The tenancy agreement contained an option clause to renew the tenancy for a further two years from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1997 at an agreed rental of RM2,250.00 per month. The option to renew was exercised by the respondents, so the tenancy would expire on 31 March 1997.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Some months before the expiry of the tenancy, correspondence was exchanged between the appellant and respondents about the demised premises, with the appellant indicating to the respondents that even though it wished to have the demised premises for its own use, it was prepared to grant the respondents a new tenancy for three years at RM4,500.00 per month with an option to renew for another two years at a rental of RM6,000.00 per month, and sent the respondents a draft tenancy agreement. However the parties could not agree on the new rentals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> As a result no new tenancy agreement was entered into between the appellant and the respondents after 31 March 1997, but the respondent continued to remain in occupation of the demised premises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 6 May 1997 the appellant commenced this suit at the Klang Magistrate's Court as Civil Summons 72-509-1997. We will return to the prayers sought in this suit shortly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant subsequently applied to transfer this suit to the Shah Alam High Court and by order dated 15 November 1997 the application was granted and this suit was registered as Shah Alam High Court Civil Suit No: 22-468- 1998 (as the entitlement of this appeal indicates).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the meantime, the appellant filed a "Notis Permohonan Bagi Pembayaran Interim" dated 18 September 1998 at the High Court Shah Alam in which the appellant applied that the respondents pay RM4,500.00 per month from April 1997 "sehingga penyelesaian tindakan ini". On 1 December 1998 by consent the High Court made an Order which in its material part reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The monthly interim payments of RM2,250.00 were apparently paid into the respondent's solicitors account from 1 December 1998.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant subsequently on 10 January 2002 filed in a Summons-in- Chambers application seeking vacant possession of the demised premises on the ground that the tenancy had expired on 31 March 1997 by effluxion of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 1 March 2004 the High Court granted the appellant's application and ordered that the respondents do quit and deliver vacant possession of the demised premises to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 30 June 2004, the respondents took steps to hand over vacant possession to the appellant, but documents seem to suggest that vacant possession was actually only handed over on 8 July 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> On 14 September 2005 the appellant filed a Summon-in-Chamber applying for payment out to it of the sum of RM193,500.00, representing the agreed rentals from April 1997 to June 2004 (when vacant possession was handed over) and which had been paid to the respondents' solicitors following the consent order of 5 November 1997.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On 12 July 2006 the High Court granted the appellant's application for payment out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> On 17 April 2007 the respondents' solicitors paid over to the appellant's solicitors a sum of RM195,750.00 in compliance with the High Court Order of 12 July 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> On 9 June 2008 the respondents filed a Summon-in-Chambers application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> asking the court to decide whether the court, having made (i) the Order of 1 March 2004 for vacant possession, (ii) the consent Order of 1 December 1998 for interim payment of rental at RM2,250.00 per month and (iii) the order for payment out of 12 July 2006, the court was <i>functus officio</i> in this case. After hearing submission of the parties the court (a different judge) dismissed the respondents' application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> This suit came on for trial before the learned judge on 25 April 2011. The Notes of Proceedings show that the case proceeded to trial in respect of the appellant's claim and the respondents' counterclaim. The appellant and the respondents called one witness each.</p>
    <p>In her judgment the learned judge identified the two issues for trial as these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In respect of the appellant's claim for double rental the learned judge held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned judge also dismissed the respondents' counterclaim for reasons which we need not go into for the present purposes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>This Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On behalf of the appellant it was argued that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> had no application to the facts here and the appellant, by accepting the payment out of the rentals cannot be deemed to have waived its claim for double rentals. It is the appellant's case that since the respondents had continued to occupy the demised premises after the tenancy period that expired on 30 March 1997, it became necessary to apply for an order that the respondents make interim payments of the monthly rental, "sehingga penyelesaian tindakan ini." According to the appellant the issue of whether it was entitled to be paid double rental was never considered by the court when it granted its consent order of 1 December 1998 nor was it an issue between the parties in the application for interim payment of rental. Likewise, the appellant said that when the court made its order for payment out on 12 July 2006, the issue of double rental was not the issue before the court. The order for payment out was in respect of the interim payment of rentals for the period 1 April 1997 to 30 June 2004 amounting to RM195,750.00 which was calculated at RM2,250.00 per month. Hence the order for payment out also did not concern the appellant's claim for double rental.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Accordingly it was the appellant's contention that its claim for double rental was very much a "live" issue when the case came up for trial before the learned judge on 25 April 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The respondents contended that the order for possession made on 1 March 2004 was a "judgment" and therefore was not interim in nature since it gave possession of the premises to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The respondents next referred to the doctrine of res judicata and to that passage in the judgment in <i>Henderson v. Henderson</i> [1843] 3 Hare 100 at p 115 where Wigram VC said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Relying on the above passage and what learned counsel for the respondents described as the application of <i>res judicata</i> in its "wider sense", the respondents contended that when the appellant applied for vacant possession by its summons-in-chambers the appellant could also have included a prayer for double rent from 1 April 1997 until possession was delivered up. The respondents contended that by not doing so, the following things resulted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We do not agree with the respondents' submissions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the first place, the learned judge applied the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> based on the Order made on 1 December 1998 and the subsequent Order of payment out dated 12 July 2006. Both Orders must be read properly. The Order made on 1 December 1998 is of particular importance. It relates only to the interim payment of monthly rentals of RM2,250.00 per month pending the final disposal of the action. The Order clearly did not relate to or concern the issue of whether the appellant was entitled to be paid double rental. Clearly the Order of 1 December 1995 was neither a final order in relation to the claim for double rental nor had the Order of 1 December 1998 been made on the merits regarding the payment of double rentals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In the second place, the subsequent Order for payment out dated 12 July 2006 relates directly to the payment out of interim rentals of RM2,250.00 which has nothing to do nor concerns the issue of whether the appellant is entitled to be paid double rental.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In the third place, we do not agree with the respondents' contention that because the appellant did not put forward its claim for double rental when it applied for an Order of vacant possession, the appellant is barred by res judicata from relitigating the claim. It must not be overlooked that when the appellant filed this suit, one of the reliefs it sought was for payment of double rental. Therefore, the appellant had already complied with the rule spoken of by Wigram VC in <i>Henderson v. Henderson (supra)</i> that a litigant, should put forward his whole case. Having done so, we find nothing wrong in the appellant having made an interlocutory application for vacant possession while leaving the issue of double rental to go to trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The appellant's claim to be paid double rental having been already put on the record and before the court waiting to be tried, we cannot see on what basis the learned judge found the appellant is deemed to have waived its claim for double rental. The claim for double rental is a claim recognised by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;28.;;">s 28(4)(a) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>. The section states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So the appellant's claim for double rental fell to be decided on the issue whether the respondents were holding over after the determination of their tenancy, which is a completely different issue from whether the appellant is entitled to obtain an interim payment of rental while awaiting the outcome of the case. We do not see how the appellant can be said to have waived such a claim when it obtained an order for payment out of the interim rentals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The respondents also argued that the Order for vacant possession was a final judgment. We do not agree. Clearly the Order for vacant possession did not address or decide the question of whether the appellant was entitled to be paid double rental.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The respondents also contended that the appellant had "abandoned" its claim for double rental when it adopted one of the two alternatives and mutually exclusive courses open to it. According to the respondent by applying for payment out of the interim monthly rentals the appellant had adopted a course which is opposite to its right to double rentals. Therefore, according to the respondents the appellant had abandoned its claim for double rental. We do not agree. Contrary to what the respondent claims, the appellant's claim for double rental and the appellant's application for interim payment of monthly rentals are not claims which are alternative and mutually exclusive to the other. As we indicated earlier, they are completely different claims - one is a payment for holding over whereas the other is a payment of rental, both of which a landlord would be entitled to claim if he can prove the factual circumstances permitting him to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> With regard to the appellant's claim for double rental, we were informed by counsel that the learned judge did not make any finding on the issue of when the tenancy was determined, even though she was asked to decide that question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We find there is sufficient evidence in the Record of Appeal to allow us to come to a finding that the respondents' tenancy determined on 31 March 1997 by effluxion of time. The evidence led through Yew Ah Kow (PW1) on behalf of the appellant was that the respondents' initial tenancy agreement was for a period of period of three years commencing from 1 July 1989 until 30 June 1991 at a monthly rental of RM1,250.00 per month. In 1992 the appellant and respondents entered into a fresh tenancy agreement dated 11 May 1992 which the court marked exh P3. The tenancy period were for three years commencing 1 April 1992 and expiring on 31 March 1995. The agreement contained an option to renew for a further term of two years at a rental not to exceed 25% of the last rental paid by cl 5(d). PW1's evidence was that the respondent duly exercised the option and so the tenancy was extended for another two years from 31 March 1995 at an agreed rental of RM2,250.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> PW1 testified that at the end of the extended term of two years on 31 March 1997, no fresh tenancy agreement was entered into with the respondents although a draft tenancy agreement was prepared by the appellant's solicitors and forwarded to the respondents on 3 December 1996. In the draft the appellant wanted a monthly rental of RM4,800.00 per month and if the option to renew for a further two years was exercised the rental would be RM6,000.00 per month, but since the amount of rentals could not be agreed upon, no new tenancy agreement was signed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In his evidence Mr Tan Whye Kion (DW1) said the respondents did not agree to the increase in rental in the draft tenancy agreement as it represented a 100% increase for the first three years period and the appellant was informed of it by the respondent's letter dated 27 January 1997.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> On 20 March 1997 the appellant's solicitor wrote to the respondent asking them to deliver vacant possession of the demised premises on 31 March 1997 and in the event the respondent did not do so, the respondent will be treated as a tenant holding over who is liable to pay double rental. On 12 May 1997, after the expiry to the tenancy, the respondent wrote to the appellant tendering RM2,250.00 by way of rental but by letter dated 15 May 1997 the appellant wrote back saying the tenancy had been terminated on 31 March 1997 and refused to accept the respondents' payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In our judgment the above evidence clearly establishes that by 31 March 1997 the tenancy of the respondents had determined by effluxion of time, whereafter no new tenancy agreement was entered into between the parties. Instead of delivering up vacant possession of the demised premises the respondents continued to hold over after the determination of their tenancy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In our judgment, on the respondents continuing to hold over the demised premises after the determination of their tenancy by effluxion of time, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;28.;;">s 28(4)(a) of the Civil Law Act</LINK> came into play and the appellants were entitled to charge the respondents double the amount of their rental or with double the value of the demised premises. In this case the appellant chose to claim double the amount of the respondents' rental. The evidence shows that when the tenancy expired, the respondent was paying RM2,250.00 per month rental. Double that would amount to RM4,500.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It was for all the above reasons that we found the learned judge had erred in law and on the facts in arriving at her decision. We accordingly allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the learned judge in relation to the appellant and made the following orders;</p>
