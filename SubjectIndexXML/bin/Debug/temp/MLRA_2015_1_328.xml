    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court dismissing its claim against the 3rd respondent ('respondent') who was a joint and several guarantor together with the 1st and 2nd respondents under a letter of guarantee for the borrower company. The appellant's action against the 1st and 2nd respondents was not proceeded with as they had left the country. The appellant claimed that the High Court erred in holding that there was no proof of service of a letter of demand dated 21 June 2002 to the respondent as it was not proved by a certificate of posting. The respondent, however, averred that the said letter of demand was sent to a different address from the one appearing on the letter of guarantee. Also, the only pleaded letter of demand was that dated 27 June 2002, and the demand letter dated 21 June 2002 was not pleaded. Further, the pleaded letter of demand dated 27 June 2002 was to the borrower and copied to the respondent, and a copy of a demand to the borrower was not a demand against the guarantor. That apart, the purported letter of demand dated 21 June 2002 gave notice for only RM74,382.64 and not for the whole sum claimed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> While the easy way to prove service by posting was by a certificate of posting, it did not preclude proof by other means. The High Court failed to take into consideration that the respondent wrote a letter dated 24 June 2002 wherein he mentioned having been misled into signing the guarantee as well as accepting variations to the loan. Although no mention was made of a letter of demand dated 21 June 2002, the letter acknowledged liability and offered RM100,000 to discharge him of his obligations. It was improbable that a guarantor would offer to pay such a considerable sum in the face of financial hardship unless he had received a demand and was seeking leniency to limit his liability to RM100,000. (para 6)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The High Court erred in holding that the letter of demand of 21 June 2002 was not posted to the agreed address under cl 7 of the letter of guarantee. Clause 7 provided that service was not limited to the particular address under the guarantee and could be sent to the last known address. The address in the letter of demand was the same address that the respondent used in his letter of 24 June 2002. As such, it could not be rejected as the last known address for the respondent. (paras 8-10)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The respondent's letter of 24 June 2002 showed that he obviously realised that the liability would be considerably more than RM74,382.64 and he sought leniency to limit his liability and offered to pay RM100,000. There was no reason why he would have offered to pay RM100,000 upon a demand for RM74,382.64. Clearly the respondent knew there was no likelihood of RM74,382.64 as demanded and the full sum outstanding under the loan would become due. In the circumstances, the High Court erred in failing to appreciate the other evidence before the court to hold that upon a balance of probabilities the letter of demand of 21 June 2002 was served and received by the respondent.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant Southern Finance Berhad ("the appellant") appealed against the decision of the High Court dismissing its claim against the 3rd respondent Abdul Hamid bin A Samad ("the respondent"), a joint and several guarantor together with the 1st and 2nd respondents, under a Letter of Guarantee dated 26 March 1997 of the borrower, Mobility Avenue Sdn Bhd ("the borrower"). The appellant's action against the 1st and 2nd respondents were not proceeded with as they had left the country.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Having heard the counsel for the parties on their submissions, the appeal was allowed with costs fixed in the sum of RM35,000.00 here and below and judgment was entered for the appellant per prayers 9 (i), (ii) and (iii) in the statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Letter Of Demand</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> A letter of demand is a pre-requisite to a claim against a guarantor in an on demand guarantee (RR(B&amp;C)2:124): <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_128;"><i>YM Orang Kaya Menteri Paduka Dato' Wan Ahmad Isa Shukri Wan Rashidi v. Kwong Yik Bank Bhd (2)</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 128</LINK>; [1989] 3 MLJ 155; [1989] 1 CLJ 187. The appellant submitted that the High Court erred in holding (RR(A)1:42 para 26) there was no proof of service of a Letter of Demand:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It was submitted for the respondent that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The reasoning by the High Court took into account that (a) the certificate of posting exh P5 was dated 27 June 2002, (b) the same date as exh P3 the Letter of Demand addressed to the borrower, while (c) exh P4 the Letter of Demand to the guarantor is dated 21 June 2002, to hold that therefore upon a balance of probabilities, exh P5 evidences the posting of exh P3. The flaw in the reasoning, however, is that the only way service by post is proved is by a certificate of posting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> While the easy way to prove service by posting is by a certificate of posting, it does not preclude poof by other means. The High Court failed to take into consideration that the respondent wrote the letter dated 24 June 2002 (RR(B&amp;C)2:186). Although the respondent's letter spoke of having been misled into signing the guarantee as well as acceptance of variations to the loan, and no mention was made of a Letter of Demand dated 21 June 2002, the letter acknowledged liability and offered RM100,000.00 to discharge him of his obligations. It is improbable that a guarantor offers to pay such considerable sum in the face of financial hardship unless he had received a demand and is seeking leniency to limit his liability to RM100,000.00 and no more.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> At para (31) of its grounds of judgement, the High Court reasoned:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In holding that the Letter of Demand P4 was not posted to the agreed address under cl 7 of the Letter of Guarantee (RR(B&amp;C)2:126), the High Court erred since cl 7 provided:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In short, service is not limited to the particular address, but may be sent to the last known address.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We observe also that although in his letter of 24 June 2002, the respondent said he was not directly involved in the company other than as a trustee, the address he used was "3rd Floor, Plaza Damansara Utama No 2, Jalan SS 21/60, 47400 Damansara Utama, Petaling Jaya Selangor Darul Ehsan." That address cannot be rejected as a last known address for the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We find the submission for the respondent that "Demand only for RM74,382.64 and not for the whole sum and no termination and recall of facility." at first somewhat puzzling because if the defence that the Letter of Demand P4 dated 21 June 2002 was not served upon the respondent, is genuine, there is no necessity to pursue the argument that the demand was for RM74,382.64 and not the whole sum upon a termination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The respondent's letter of 24 June 2002 shows the respondent obviously realised that the liability would be considerably more than RM74,382.64 and he sought leniency to limit his liability and offered to pay RM100,000.00. Otherwise why offer to pay RM100,000.00 upon a demand for RM74,382.64. Clearly the respondent knew there was no likelihood of RM74,382.64 as demanded and the full sum outstanding under the loan would become due.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Finding no merit in the submissions for the respondent, and that the High Court had erred in failing to appreciate the other evidence before the court to hold that upon a balance of probabilities the Letter of Demand P4 was served and received by the respondent, we allowed the appeal and entered judgment for the appellant as prayed in the appellant's statement of claim.</p>
