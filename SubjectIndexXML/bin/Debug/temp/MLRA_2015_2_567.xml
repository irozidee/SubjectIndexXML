    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the dismissal by the High Court of the appellant's application to restore and reinstate its appeal in Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006 ("Appeal 12-18-2006") from the decision of the Sessions Court. In the Sessions Court, the appellant had commenced an action against the respondent to recover taxes under additional assessments. The Sessions Court allowed the respondent's application to strike out the appellant's action. In the High Court, the appellant filed Appeal 12-18-2006 pursuant to an order of the Sessions Court to allow filing out of time. Dissatisfied with the Sessions Court's decision to allow the filing out of time, the respondent filed Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006 ("Appeal 12-17-2006") in the High Court against the grant of leave by the Sessions Court. Both appeals were heard by the High Court, and Appeal 12-17-2006 was allowed, whereas Appeal 12-18-2006 was struck off. Subsequently, the appellant's appeal against the dismissal of Appeal 12-18-2006 was allowed by the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No: Q-01-130-2009 ("Appeal Q-01-130-2009"). However, on an application before the High Court, the appellant's application for reinstatement of Appeal 12-18-2006 was dismissed. Hence, the instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (appeal allowed with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court decided to strike out Appeal 12-18-2006 on the ground that Appeal 12-17-2006 was allowed, thereby setting aside the leave granted to the appellant by the Sessions Court to file out of time. It was that appeal against the setting aside by the High Court of the order of the Sessions Court that was allowed by the Court of Appeal in Appeal Q-01-130-2009, in which an order to restore Appeal 12-18-2006 was granted. In this instance, in dismissing the Court of Appeal's order, the High Court overlooked the notes of proceedings of the High Court in Appeal 12-18-2006 that the decision in Appeal 12-17-2006 had led directly to the striking out of the Appeal 12-18-2006, since without the extension of time granted by the Sessions Court, Appeal 12-18-2006 could not be filed. Therefore, Appeal 12-18-2006 was not heard and dismissed on its own merits. Accordingly, an order that Appeal 12-18-2006 before the High Court be reinstated was entered. (paras 13-16)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The plaintiff Kerajaan Malaysia ("the appellant") appealed against the dismissal by the High Court of the appellant's application to restore and reinstate the appellant's appeal in Appeal 12-18-2006 from the decision of the Sessions Court in Summons No: 51-7-2005(MR), where the appellant had commenced action against the defendant Tai Choi Yu ("the respondent") to recover the sum of RM161,119.52 being taxes under additional assessments for years of assessment 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The Sessions Court had on 5 May 2006 allowed the respondent's application to strike out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_328;14.;;">O 14 r 21 of Subordinate Courts Rules 1980</LINK> the appellant's above-mentioned summons and statement of claim with costs. The appellant's appeal was registered as Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) pursuant to an order of the Sessions Court to allow filing out of time. Being dissatisfied with the Sessions Court decision to allow filing out of time, the respondent filed an appeal to the High Court, registered as Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006(MR). Both appeals were heard on 29 October 2008, where Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006(MR) was heard first and allowed. Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) was struck off.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The leave to appeal sought in Civil Application Q-08-339-2008 was granted on 19 March 2009. A notice of appeal was filed on 6 April 2009 registered as Civil Appeal Q-01-130-2009. On 8 February 2011, the appeal was heard and allowed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> When the appellant's application before the High Court for reinstatement was dismissed with cost, the appellant sought and obtained under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;68.;;">s 68(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> leave to appeal to this court. The instant appeal was the appeal for which that leave was granted and a notice of appeal accordingly filed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The submission for the appellant, briefly, was that the effect of the Court of Appeal allowing Civil Appeal No: Q-01-130-2009 was that the decision of the High Court in Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006(MR) was overturned, and that Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR), summarily struck off should be reinstated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The respondent submitted it was not true that Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) affirmed the dismissal/striking out by the Sessions Court and it was not true that Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) was struck off without a hearing on the merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It was obvious that although the ruling and the orders in Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006(MR) and Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) were in the appeal record, determination of the effect of the orders required an appreciation of what was heard before the High Court and if necessary the background in the Sessions Court. Parties were directed to file additional record of appeal, and that the appeal would be heard afresh on 8 October 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Heard afresh on 8 October 2013, the submissions for the parties remained in substance the same, consistent with the grounds in the memorandum of appeal that the High Court erred:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Examination Of The Record, Findings And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We examined the ruling on 12 August 2011 by the High Court. It is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We then examined the Supplementary Record of Appeal filed. It showed, <i>inter alia</i>, the Notes of Proceedings of the High Court in Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR). It is clear from the Notes of Proceedings, a contemporaneous record of the decision, that Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) was struck out for the reason that Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006(MR) was allowed, and not dismissed on its own merits:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Since the appeal is allowed in 12-17-2008(MR), this appeal is academic and therefore be struck out with costs to be taxed, unless agreed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The above settles the question as to what was decided on 29 October 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We reproduce again paras 3 and 4 of the ruling:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The inaccuracy in para 3 of the ruling as to Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006(MR) is minor and does not affect the fact that the High Court on 29 October 2008 did decide:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It is that appeal against the setting aside by the High Court of the order of the Sessions Court made on 16 November 2006 that was allowed by the Court of Appeal on 8 February 2011:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The High Court, however, overlooked the Notes of Proceedings of the High Court as reproduced at para 10 above, leading the High Court to a decision it could not otherwise have made. The decision in Civil Appeal No: 12-17-2006(MR) that extension of time should not have been granted led directly to the striking out of the appeal in Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) since without the extension of time granted by the Sessions Court, Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) could not be filed. Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006 was not heard and dismissed on its own merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We, therefore, allowed the appeal with costs in the sum of RM10,000.00, set aside the order of the High Court, and entered an order that Civil Appeal No: 12-18-2006(MR) before the High Court be reinstated.</p>
