    <p>The appellants appealed against their conviction and sentence after being jointly charged for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('DDA')</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. In this appeal, the appellants raised only one ground of appeal. The 1st appellant argued that at the end of the prosecution's case, the trial judge failed to adequately consider all evidence available including evidence favourable to the defence. On the other hand, the 2nd appellant contended that the trial judge failed to consider his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the 1st appellant's appeal and allowing the 2nd appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant appeal, the trial judge had not erred in her evaluation of the evidence and the application of the law. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses as a whole was suffiient to establish a prima facie case against the appellants. Insofar as the 1st appellant was concerned, there was no appealable error in the evaluation of the defence and in the fidings of the trial judge. Furthermore, the 1st appellant was not consistent in his version of events. Thus, looking at the evidence in totality, the 1st appellant's defence failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and failed to rebut the presumption of traffiking on a balance of probabilities. (paras 19-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Upon perusal of the grounds of judgment, nowhere did the trial judge consider the 2nd appellant's defence. Hence, the 2nd appellant's defence was not adequately considered by the trial judge. Had the trial judge considered all the evidence as required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>, the trial judge would have found that the defence of 2nd appellant had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and that the conviction of the 2nd appellant was not safe.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants were jointly charged in the High Court at Shah Alam for the offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. They were convicted and sentenced to death. Against the conviction and sentence, the appellants fied separate appeals. We heard both appeals together. In this judgment, we will refer to the appellant in Appeal No: B-05-11-01-2013 and B-05-12-01-2013 as the 1st appellant and the 2nd appellant respectively. They were the 1st accused and the 2nd accused respectively in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The case for the prosecution as set out by the learned trial judge was as follows. On 22 July 2010, ASP Zamri bin Razak (SP3) and fie other policemen were conducting an operation at the luggage claim area G at the KLIA Terminal, when he observed two men (later identifid as the appellants) were acting suspiciously. The appellants seemed hesitant to leave the luggage claim area and were continuously casting furtive glances left and right. When they fially decided to leave, the 1st appellant was seen pushing a trolley with two bags on it. The 2nd appellant, who had with him a sling bag, was closely following the 1st appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellants were apprehended and according to SP3, they looked fearful ('sedikit takut'). The appellants were brought to the airport narcotics offie for examination. A body search was done on both the appellants. Nothing incriminating was found on them. SP3 examined the two bags (exhs P29 and P48) which had the name tags of the 1st appellant. The bags were not locked but the keys were recovered from the trouser's pocket of the 1st appellant. There were only a few items of clothing and toiletries in both bags. The clothes were said to fi the appellants well.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> SP3 found the interior side wall of the bags thicker than ordinary bags. Upon further examination of both exhs P29 and P48, SP3 found two clear plastic packages in each of the bags (exhs P20 and P24; exhs P11 and P15 respectively) hidden in the inner wall. Each package contained crystallite powders which were later confimed by the chemist (SP3) to be methamphetamine weighing a total of 1483 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case, having considered the manner the drugs were concealed, the conduct of the appellants when they were apprehended and the weight of the drugs, the learned trial judge found that the appellants had <i>mens rea possession</i> of the drugs. Her Ladyship then invoked <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> to fid a case of traffiking. The appellants were called upon to enter their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Both appellants gave evidence on oath. The essence of the 1st appellant's defence was that he was an innocent carrier. He had travelled from Tehran to Syria by bus. At Syria airport, the fit appellant met his friend, Mustafa. The 1st appellant stated that Mustafa had given him two empty suitcases and that upon enquiries, Mustafa told him that the suitcases contained medication which was hidden to avoid tax. The appellant was asked by Mustafa to deliver the bags to Amir in Malaysia. The 1st appellant further stated that the 2nd appellant was merely tagging along.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 2nd appellant testifid that his purpose of coming to Malaysia was to tour the country. He denied having anything to do with the two bags containing the drugs. He stated that he only carried with him the sling bag and that his clothes were in the sling bag.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned trial judge found that the defence of the appellants did not create a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and did not rebut the presumption of traffiking. The appellants were thus convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Before us, the appellants raised only one ground of appeal. For the 1st appellant, learned counsel argued that at the end of the prosecution's case, the learned trial judge had failed to adequately consider all evidence available, including evidence favourable to the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It was the submission of learned counsel for the 1st appellant that the learned trial judge failed to consider the evidence from all angles, in particular the following evidence, which learned counsel contended was favourable to the defence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Learned counsel for the 1st appellant argued that had a maximum evaluation been carried out at the end of the prosecution case by the learned trial judge, the evidence disclosed at most, an offence of passive possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39A.;;">s 39A(2) of the Act</LINK>. Learned counsel therefore urged us to substitute the conviction with one of possession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> For the 2nd appellant, the complaint was that the learned trial judge had failed to consider the defence. Learned counsel submitted that the learned trial judge had not considered the following evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Having considered the submissions of the parties and having perused the records of appeal, we unanimously dismissed the appeal of the 1st appellant and we allowed the appeal of the 2nd appellant. We now give our reasons for the said decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case, we found that the learned trial judge had correctly made a fiding that a prima facie case had been made out against the appellants. In particular, the learned trial judge had considered the element of possession as follows (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 5 p 435):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned trial judge further stated that (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 5 pp 436- 437):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned trial judge had also considered the issue of conduct when Her Ladyship said (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 5 p 438):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We found no merits in the submissions of learned counsel for the 1st appellant that the learned trial judge had failed to consider that the evidence from all angles. The learned trial judge had considered the facts highlighted by the defence when Her Ladyship stated that (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 5: p 439):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As for the element of traffiking, the learned trial judge found that since the weight of methamphetamine exceeded the statutory limit of 50 grams, the presumption pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(vi) of the Act</LINK> was triggered to raise a case of traffiking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In our judgment, the learned trial judge had not erred in her evaluation of the evidence and the application of the law. As regards the police report, it was our view that the omission or the alleged inconsistencies highlighted by the learned counsel did not affect the prosecution's case (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2012_287;"><i>Danny Phiri v. PP</i> [2012] MLRAU 287</LINK> and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2012_366;"><i>Mohd Shukri bin Abu Seman v. PP</i> [2012] MLRAU 366</LINK>). Even without the fiting exercise and the evidence of SP3 on the conduct, we were of the view that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as a whole was suffiient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant. We found no reason to intervene with the fidings of the learned trial judge at the end of the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Insofar as the 1st appellant was concerned, we found no appealable error in the evaluation of the defence and in the following fidings of the learned trial judge (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 5: pp 447-448):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Further, we noted that the 1st appellant had not been consistent in his version. In his evidence in court, the 1st appellant stated that Mustafa handed the two bags to him at the Syria airport (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2: p 114) while in his cautioned statement, he stated that Mustafa had given him the bags at the Bus Terminal in Tehran (Rekod Rayuan Tambahan 1: p 22). Looking at the evidence in totality, we agreed with the learned trial judge that the defence was not reasonable; that the defence failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and failed to rebut the presumption of traffiking on a balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In respect of the 2nd appellant, the learned trial judge made the following fiding at the end of the defence case (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 5: p 451):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> To recapitulate, the defence of the 2nd appellant was that he was merely following the 1st appellant to come to Malaysia. His evidence that he came to Malaysia as a tourist and that he had no knowledge of the drugs was consistent with his cautioned statement (exh D71). The 2nd appellant's version also found support in the oral evidence of the 1st appellant wherein the 1st appellant stated that (Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2: p 117):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The 2nd appellant's defence that he had no knowledge of the drugs was also consistent with the cautioned statement of the 1st appellant wherein the 1st appellant stated that (Rekod Rayuan Tambahan: p 23):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Having perused the grounds of judgment, we found that nowhere did the learned trial judge consider the above evidence. We therefore agreed with learned counsel that the learned trial judge had failed to adequately consider the defence. Had the learned trial judge considered all the evidence as required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>, Her Ladyship would have found that the defence of 2nd appellant that he had no knowledge of the drugs had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and that the conviction of the 2nd appellant was not safe.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the light of all the above, we were unanimous in our decision that the appeal of the 1st appellant be dismissed. We affimed the conviction and sentence of the High Court on the 1st appellant. The appeal by the 2nd appellant was allowed. We set aside the conviction and sentence of the High Court. The 2nd appellant was acquitted and discharged.</p>
