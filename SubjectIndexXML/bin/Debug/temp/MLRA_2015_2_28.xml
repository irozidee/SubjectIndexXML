    <p>The High Court allowed the respondent's claim against the appellants for a default in banking facilities that had amounted to RM2,042,204.21. The respondent had provided the banking facilities to the 1st appellant company with the 2nd and 3rd appellants as guarantors. The appellants disputed the respondent's claim and alleged that the facilities were not utilised as the appellants had been unable to comply with the conditions precedent specified in the letter of offer. Alternatively, even if the facilities were granted, the appellants alleged that there was no drawdown and put the respondent to strict proof of its claim. In the High Court proceedings, the appellants strongly objected to the respondent's filing of voluminous documents mid-way through the trial and the introduction of new witnesses. The appellants claimed that the respondent was attempting to paint a different picture when it was recognised that the evidence adduced did not support its averments. As such, the appellants submitted a submission of no case to answer without calling any witnesses. The learned judge held that the failure to call evidence was fatal to the appellants' case and therefore the respondent had proved its case against the appellants. Hence, the appellants appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, unanimously allowing the appeal with costs</p>
    <p>Per Mohtarudin Baki JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondent had a duty to prove that the facilities were released to the appellants on the balance of probabilities, failing which, the appellants would be entitled to make a submission of no case to answer. However, the evidence showed that the banking facilities were not released to the appellants as the conditions precedent were not fulfilled. The respondent therefore failed to discharge the burden of proof under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">s 101 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. (paras 10-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In an action for recovery, a proper demand must be made to the guarantors before an action could be initiated against them. The Letter of Guarantee clearly showed that the guarantee was an "on demand" guarantee from the words "we will pay you on demand" stated therein. The mere filing of the writ and service was insufficient demand. Also, the demand filed by the respondent in the appeal record did not show evidence of posting in the absence of the relevant AR (acknowledgement receipt) card in the bundle concerned. It followed that there was no evidence that the demand was sent to the appellants. (paras 14-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The learned judge failed to consider that the respondent did not prove (i) that the appellants adhered to the conditions precedent before the facilities were released, (ii) that there was a drawdown of the said facilities, and (iii) that a proper demand was made to the guarantors. In the circumstances, the respondent failed to prove its case against the appellants on the balance of probabilities. (para 20)</p>
    <p>Per Zaleha Zahari JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The manner in which the respondent proceeded to prove its case was extremely unsatisfactory. The appellants rightly objected to the filing of the four Supplementary Bundle of Documents, long after the period to do so had expired, after four of the respondent's witnesses gave their evidence. Enclosures (11), (19), (22) and (24) were introduced on a piecemeal basis which was grossly unfair to the appellants as the appellants were not given an opportunity to inspect them. Further, the documents in the said enclosures were disputed documents. (para 69)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> From the record it appeared that the trial judge did not return to the issue of whether or not to admit the documents listed in encls (11), (19), (22), and (24). The trial judge could not rely upon documents not admitted in evidence. (para 71)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was clearly inordinate and inexplicable delay as to why the documents were not introduced earlier when the documents had always been in the possession of the respondent. All those documents were available when the case management was held. (para 72)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The respondent was clearly not diligent in preparing its case. The respondent adopted a lackadaisical attitude in the preparation of its case and was guilty of indolence. The question of denying the respondent the right to produce those documents did not arise. The respondent had only itself to blame for the predicament it found itself in. Justice was not only for the respondent but also for the appellants. The objection taken by the appellants should have been sustained. Not having obtained leave of the court, the respondent should not have been allowed to introduce additional witnesses, with such witnesses referring to the documents filed mid-way through trial. (para 73)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The learned judge arrived at his decision on evidence, the veracity of which remained suspended. The evidence led by additional witnesses by reference to the documents filed later must be expunged from the court record. They should not have been taken into consideration. Shorn of such evidence, there was no evidence that the appellants complied with the conditions precedent imposed by the respondent. Consequently, the facilities were either not utilised or were withdrawn by the respondent. (para 74)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> There were two sets of circumstances under which a defendant might submit that he had no case to answer. There might be such submission, firstly in a situation where, accepting the plaintiff's evidence at its face value, no case was established in law; and in the other, the evidence led by the plaintiff was so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court should find that the burden of proof was not discharged. In the present case, the evidence led by the respondent was unsatisfactory. The trial judge should have made a finding that the respondent did not discharge the burden of proof and that there was no case for the appellants to answer. (paras 75-76)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohtarudin Baki JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is the appellants' appeal against the decision of High Court dated 30 July 2009 allowing the respondent's claim against the appellants in respect of a default of Banking Facilities totaling RM2,042,204.21. For ease of reference, we shall refer the appellants as the defendants and the respondent as the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> By Letter of Offer dated 21 July 1997, the plaintiff provided Banking Facilities to the 1st defendant while the 2nd and 3rd defendants were guarantors for the 1st defendant. The plaintiff claimed that the 1st defendant had breached the Terms and Conditions of the Letter of Offer and therefore defaulted on the said Banking Facilities. Thus, the 2nd and 3rd defendants liable to repay the plaintiff based on the Letter of Guarantee dated 31 December 1997. The plaintiff claimed that the 1st respondent had taken the Overdraft Facility (RM498,846.27) and Letters of Credit, Trust Receipt, Bankers Acceptance and Bank Guarantee (RM1,543,357.94) totaling RM2,042,204.21 as at 28 February 2001.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the proceedings before High Court, nine witnesses gave evidence for the plaintiff. The defendants closed the case without calling any witness and submitted a submission of no case to answer. Learned trial judge found that the defendants' objection during the trial was related to technical matter and was inconsistent with the defence. Upon perusal of the defence, it clearly shows that failure to call evidence was fatal to the defendants' case and therefore the plaintiff had proved their case against the defendants. The learned trial judge was of the view that the plaintiff 's claim should be allowed for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned trial judge then found the defendants did not defend the plaintiff 's action. Therefore, the plaintiff 's claim is allowed with interest and costs fixed at RM10,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appeal Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On appeal, it was submitted that the defendants failed to comply with the Conditions Precedent of the Letter of Offer as the Banking Facilities would only be released after the defendants comply with the Conditions Precedent stipulated at pp 7, 8 and 11 of the Banking Facilities. The wording of the said Conditions Precedent clearly states "shall be released" which makes it a mandatory requirement to comply with the said Conditions Precedent before the Banking Facilities can be released to the defendants. For convenience, we reproduce the said Conditions Precedent (at pp 7, 8 and 11, Part C of the Appeal Record) which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that during cross-examination, the Branch Manager of the appellant (PW3) failed to show that the defendants complied with the Conditions Precedent. His answers to all questions relating to the said documents stated in the Conditions Precedent were in negative. The relevant excerpt of PW3's testimony during cross-examination:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Similarly PW4, the Customer Relation Officer (CRO) who was in charge of the 1st defendant account had also failed to show that the defendants complied with the Conditions Precedent stipulated in the Letter of Offer. All his answers for similar questions directed to PW3 during cross-examination were "tiada di dalam Bundle Dokumen".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Therefore, based on the above testimonies, it is clear that there was no evidence that the defendants had complied with the strict Conditions Precedent contained in the Letter of Offer. It is further submitted by the defendants that the plaintiff failed to prove that the 1st defendant had complied with the Conditions Precedent in the Letter of Offer to avail them of the purported facilities offered by the plaintiff. The Letter of Offer though accepted does not automatically confer the right to the defendants to be entitled to the said facilities which was only available for the defendants' when all the conditions stipulated in the said Facilities (including the Conditions Precedent) were fulfilled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In the alternative, the defendants submitted that if the said facilities were granted, they had never been utilised by the defendants as there is no documentary or other evidence of any proof of a drawdown.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We are in agreement with the submission of the learned counsel for defendants on this issue. The plaintiff had failed to prove that the Conditions Precedent were adhered to by the defendants as it is contrary with the evidence of PW3 and PW4 who confirmed that the defendants had not complied with the Conditions Precedent resulting the facilities were not made available to the defendants. It is the duty of the plaintiff to prove that the facilities were released to the defendants on the balance of probabilities, failing which, will entitle the defendants to make a submission of no case to answer as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">s 101 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. Therefore, we find that the learned trial judge failed to appreciate the fact that the defendants failed to comply with the Conditions Precedent before the facilities "shall be released" to 1st defendant. The plaintiff had also failed to show any proof of drawdown of the said facilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Next, the issue is whether the defendants utilise or drawdown the Banking Facilities? From the evidence gleaned above, PW3 had confirmed that although there was an offer for the Banking Facilities, they were not been utilised by the defendants. We find in the Supplementary Appeal Record (at p 34), PW3 had testified during cross-examination that: "From the documents that I have at the moment, I can't prove the facility was drawdown". Based on the evidence of PW4, he confirmed that the plaintiff would not allow the defendants to do a drawdown if the defendants failed to comply with the Conditions Precedent. Therefore, we are of the view that since the Banking Facilities were never utilised by the defendants for non-compliance of the said Conditions Precedent, the said facilities were never released to the defendants. For that being so, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove in evidence that the facilities were granted without the Conditions Precedent being fulfilled. However, the plaintiff had failed to do so. Therefore, the plaintiff had not discharge the burden of proof imposed on them under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">s 101 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_3_196;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Formerly Lembaga Letrik Negara Tanah Melayu) v. Perwaja Steel Sdn Bhd (Formerly Perwaja Terengganu Sdn Bhd)</i> [1995] 3 MLRH 196</LINK>; [1995] 4 MLJ 673; [1995] 4 CLJ 670, cited by the defendants, the court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Applying the principle as enunciated above, we are with the defendant's argument that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the 1st defendant had complied with the Conditions Precedent in the Banking Facilities to avail them on the facilities offered by the plaintiff. The facilities were never utilised as there is no evidence either documentary or otherwise of any proof of drawdown.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In an action for recovery, a proper demand must be made to the guarantors, ie to the 2nd and 3rd defendants before an action can be initiated against them. In the present case, the plaintiff did not satisfy the precondition of making a demand to the guarantors. The defendants submitted that the requirement of making a demand against the guarantors is <i>sine qua non</i> before an action can be commenced against the guarantors. We refer to the Letter of Guarantee found at pp 14 to 22 of the Appeal Record Part C. It is clear that the said Guarantee is an "on demand" guarantee. This can be seen from the words "we will pay you on demand".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The plaintiff argued that a demand was made vide a notice dated 12 March 2001 (at p 23 of the Rekod Rayuan Bahagian A) and was sent to the defendants respectively. Additionally the plaintiff is also relying on the evidence of PW9, an advocate and solicitor who testified that notices of demand were issued to the defendants on behalf of the plaintiff which can be found at pp 69-70 of the Appeal Record Part B. Alternatively, the plaintiff submitted that in any event, the plaintiff 's writ and statement of claim itself is a notice to the defendants by referring to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_60;"><i>Tan Hock Chan v. Kho Teck Seng</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 60</LINK>; [1980] 1 MLJ 308.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> With respect, we are unable to agree with this proposition. It is wrong to hold that no demand was required to create a cause of action and that the mere filing of the writ and the service thereof was a sufficient demand obliging the defendants to pay. In the instant case, the letter of guarantee is clear (at pp 15 to 23 of the Appeal Record Part C). The said Letter of Guarantee was prepared by PW1. In the said Guarantee, it is clearly stated in para 1 the words "we will pay you on demand". Therefore, it is our considered view that a proper demand must be made and it is a condition precedent to establishing a claim against a guarantor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_128;"><i>YM Orang Kaya Menteri Paduka Dato' Wan Ahmad Isa Shukri Wan Rashidi v. Kwong Yik Bank Bhd (2)</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 128</LINK>; [1989] 3 MLJ 155; [1989] 1 CLJ 187 at p 131 where Lee Hun Hoe CJ held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Similarly, in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1989_2_620;"><i>MBf Finance Bhd v. Hasmat Properties Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1989] 2 MLRH 620</LINK>; [1990] 1 MLJ 180; [1990] 2 CLJ 461 when the court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>PW9 during cross-examination testified that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Thus, we are of the considered view that the learned trial judge had failed to consider that the plaintiff had failed to prove that a proper demand was made to the guarantors before the plaintiff can initiate this proceedings against them. Undeniably, there is a demand filed by the plaintiff in the Appeal Record. However, the plaintiff failed to show any evidence that such demand was sent to the defendants as there was no proof of posting. We find that the 2nd and 3rd defendants were not served with the letter of demand in the absence of the relevant AR card in the bundle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In short, we find that the learned trial judge had failed to consider the fact that; first, plaintiff failed to prove that the Conditions Precedent was adhered to by the defendants before the facilities are released to the latter; second, the plaintiff also failed to show any evidence to prove the drawdown of the said facilities without any evidence relating to it; and third, the plaintiff had failed to prove that a proper demand was made to the guarantors. Hence, the plaintiff had failed to prove their case against the defendants on the balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Grounded by the above reasoning, we unanimously allow the defendants' appeal against the decision of the learned trial judge with costs fixed at RM10,000.00. Consequently, we ordered that the Order of the High Court is set aside and deposit to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Zaleha Zahari JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On 9 January 2012 the unanimous decision of this court was to allow the defendants' appeal and to set aside the decision of the High Court Judge dated 30 July 2009. I have read the judgment of my brother, Mohtarudin Baki JCA in draft as to why this appeal was allowed. My reasons in allowing this appeal was however different. They are as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In this judgment parties will be referred as they appeared in the court below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It is necessary to set out what transpired in this case in some details.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The plaintiff (respondent in this appeal) claimed that by Letter of Offer, (ie ID5) dated 21 July 1997 they had offered to the 1st defendant overdraft (OD), Letters of Credit (LC), Trust Receipts (TR) Bank Acceptances (BA) and Bank Guarantee (BG) facilities. The plaintiff alleged that the 1st defendant was in breach of the terms and conditions set out in the said facilities of which the 2nd and 3rd defendants were guarantors pursuant to Letter of Guarantee (exh P1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In its statement of claim the plaintiff alleged that the defendants were indebted to the plaintiff as at 28 February 2001 in the following sums:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The defendants disputed the claim. The defendants' case was that the said facilities were never granted as they were unable to comply with the conditions specified in the Letter of Offer. Further and in the alternative, even if the facilities were granted the defendants claimed that they had never drawdown or utilised the facilities and put the plaintiff to strict proof of their claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The record shows that at case management pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;34.;;">O 34 on the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>, as well as when trial commenced on 24 May 2005, the plaintiff's case rests on a single Bundle of Documents, ie that listed in encl (11).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The 1st trial judge heard two of the plaintiff's witnesses, ie Rashidah bt Abu Bakar (SP1) and Lim Siew Hua (SP2). PW1's evidence was formal, ie to tender the Letter of Guarantee executed by the 2nd and 3rd defendants, (exh P1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On 24 May 2005 SP2 testified, in the absence of the Branch Manager, she signed on behalf Norhafiz bin Malan the most senior officer in the Credit Department. The Letter of Offer was also signed by Norhafiz bin Malan on behalf of the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On the continued hearing of 6 February 2006 two other witnesses testified on behalf of the plaintiff, ie Chey Onn Wah, (SP3) and Norhafiz bin Malan (SP4). The testimony of these two witnesses is reproduced for ease of reference.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(a) Chey Onn Wah</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Chey Onn Wah (SP3), the Branch Manager in cross-examination, in response to questions posed whether the defendants had complied with the Conditions Precedent stipulated in the Letter of Offer (ID5) testified as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Norhafiz bin Malan (SP4), the Customer Relationship Officer, was the officer in charge of the defendants' account. In cross-examination when questioned whether the plaintiff would allow the defendants to do a 'drawdown' if the defendants had failed to comply with the prescribed Conditions Precedent, his answer was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> What transpired on the next continued hearing date 5 July 2006 was this. There was a change of plaintiff's counsel. On this date the plaintiff was no longer represented by En Rosli but by two counsels, En Paari Perumal and En Jayaratnam. The plaintiff's new counsel applied for an adjournment on the ground that they had just been retained. The defendants' counsel objected to the adjournment on the ground that his witness, who was from Sabah, was present in court on that date. The defendants' counsel also informed the court that the defendants were strongly objecting to the fresh documents listed in encl (11) which the plaintiff was attempting to introduce which had just been filed and served on him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The court allowed the adjournment sought by the plaintiff 's counsel. The case was adjourned to 6 July 2006 for continued hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The record shows that on the continued hearing date of 6 July 2006 the hearing again did not proceed on the same ground as the previous hearing date, ie because the plaintiff had retained a new counsel to handle the plaintiff 's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> There was then a lapse of almost eight months. On the continued hearing date of 5 March 2007, SP1 was recalled to mark the guarantee as exh P1. The attempt to have the Letter of Offer to the 1st defendant (ID5) marked as an exhibit through SP1 was not allowed by the court as SP1 was not its maker.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The record shows one year and nine months lapsed before the case was called again. The next continued hearing date was 9 August 2008. On this date the defendants' counsel informed the court that the plaintiff had, two days prior to that date, (ie on 7 August 2007) served upon him yet another Bundle of Documents, ie encl (22) (2nd Supplementary Bundle). The defendants were objecting to them and that they also required time to seek client's instructions and, if need be, for the plaintiff 's witnesses to be recalled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The court ruled that it was open to the defendant to raise their objections to the documents listed in the Supplementary Bundles which had recently been filed on the next hearing date. The case was then fixed the case for continued hearing for two days on 14 May 2008 and 15 May 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> On 9 May 2008 the plaintiff 's counsel filed two further Supplementary Bundles of Documents, ie that listed in encls (22) and (23).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The record shows that on 14 May 2008, the case again did not proceed for continued hearing by reason of the two further Supplementary Bundles of Documents filed on 9 May 2008 which had just been served on the defendants' counsel. In this situation it was not surprising for the defendants' Counsel to request for time to obtain his clients' instructions in respect the documents listed in the two further Supplementary Bundles of Documents served on them. The case was then fixed for mention on 19 September 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The case was called before a different High Court Judge (second trial judge) on 18 September 2008. What transpired on 18 September 2008 before the second trial judge was significant and is reproduced in full:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> On the hearing date of 19 March 2009 for the hearing of submissions on the plaintiff 's two Supplementary Bundles of Documents which was objected to by the defendants' counsel, another High Court Judge (second trial judge) presided over the case. The minutes recorded by the second trial judge on this date was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> On 16 July 2009 the case was called up for continued hearing before yet another High Court Judge (third trial judge) whose decision was the subject matter of this appeal before us. The minutes recorded before the third trial judge on 16 July 2009 was this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The plaintiff 's counsel then called five other witnesses, ie Azman bin Bahrin (PW5), Lee Huan Nee (PW6), Johari Ariffin bin Osman (PW7), Yeap Eng Lock (PW8) and Jayaratnam a/l Kumarasamy (PW9) who were examined, subjected to cross-examination and re-examination by the defendant's Counsel. In the examination of these additional witnesses reference was made to the documents listed in Supplementary Bundle of Documents in encls (11), (19) and (22). The plaintiff then closed their case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The defendants counsel then elected to submit that that there was no case for the defendants to answer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The judge ruled in favour of the plaintiff. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The learned trial judge entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff. His reasons are set out in one solitary paragraph, ie para 5 of the judgment which states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> It is against this decision that the defendants now appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellants Counsel's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The appellants' counsel submitted that the plaintiff had not discharged the burden of proof which lies upon them. The learned High Court Judge took a simplistic view. The learned judge failed to consider fundamental issues and facts when he ruled in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The plaintiff had called four of their witnesses and the defendants had completed cross-examination of these witnesses. The defendants had tailored their cross-examination on the documents held out in the only bundle then before the court, ie encl (11).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The filing by the plaintiff of four Supplementary Bundles of Documents mid-way through trial after four of the plaintiff 's witness had completed giving their evidence and subjected to cross-examination based on encl (11) had been strongly objected to by the defendants' counsel. Likewise, the Supplementary Bundle [encl (19)] filed on the 7 August 2007, (ie two days before the continued hearing of 9 August 2007 and 10 August 2007) had also been objected by the defendants' counsel. On the 9 May 2008, (ie five days before the continued hearing of 14 May 2008 and 15 May 2008) the plaintiff filed two further Supplementary Bundles of Documents, ie that listed in encls (22) and (23).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> On 9 July 2009, (ie four days before the continued hearing dates of 13-72009 to 16 July 2009) the plaintiff filed another Supplementary Bundle of Documents, [ie encl (24)].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The defendants' counsel submitted that to allow the plaintiff to introduce voluminous documents in the form of encls (19), (22), (23) and (24) and to introduce new witnesses at such a late stage of trial was prejudicial to the defendants as the plaintiff was attempting to paint a different picture when they recognised that their avernments was not supported by their evidence. To allow the plaintiffs to adduce fresh evidence in the form of encls (19), (22), (23) and (24) and to introduce new witnesses falls nothing short but of a "trial by ambush".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The court should not allow the documents listed in the Supplementary Bundle of Documents to be part of the record because the said documents were at all material times available to the plaintiff. This is evident from the testimony of Azman bin Baharin (SP5), Lee Huan Nee (SP6), Johari Ariff bin Osman (SP7) and Yeap Eng Lock (SP8). All of the documents in encls (19), (22), (23) and ( 24) were available way back in 2003, when the case came up for case management. The plaintiff 's lackadaisical attitude prevented them from obtaining the documents at the earliest possible stage. Johari Ariff bin Osman (SP7) in cross-examination had testified that the request for the documents was only received by him from Yeap Eng Lock (SP8) in the month of July 2007. The plaintiff was clearly was not diligent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The Letter of Offer, though accepted, does not automatically confer upon the defendants the right to be entitled to the said facilities. The enjoyment of the said facilities was only available for the defendants' benefit if the defendants strictly comply with all of the Conditions Precedent. The uncontroverted and unchallenged evidence of SP3 and SP4 elicited during cross-examination was that the defendants had not complied with these Conditions Precedent. Further, even if the facilities were granted, the same was never utilised by the defendants as there is no evidence, documentary or otherwise, of any proof of drawdown.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In an action for recovery, a demand must be made to the guarantors before an action can be initiated against the guarantors, (the 2nd and 3rd defendants). The requirement of making a demand against the guarantors is a <i>sine qua non</i> before an action can be commenced against the guarantors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The defendants urged this court to allow the appeal with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondent's Counsel's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> By reason of the appellants electing to make a submission of no case to answer, all of the evidence led by the appellants are assumed to be true. The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_3_247;"><i>Mohd Nor Afandi Mohamed Junus v. Rahman Shah Alang Ibrahim &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 3 MLRA 247</LINK>; [2008] 3 MLJ 81; [2008] 2 CLJ 369 was relied as authority for this proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> On the documents not having been marked as exhibits and not admitted as evidence at trial, the respondent counsel submitted that by reason of the documents having been produced through the relevant witnesses at trial and not ruled as inadmissible, it was in order for the trial judge to rely on them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Notice of Demand to the defendants had been admitted in para 11 of the defence. A notice dated 12 March 2001 had been sent to the defendants. PW9, an advocate and solicitor, had testified that notices of demand were issued to the defendants on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff 's writ and statement of claim itself was a notice to the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The fact of disbursement of funds through overdraft and trust receipts were established through witnesses PW5, PW6, PW7 and PW8. On the Conditions Precedent not having been proved, and whether there were disbursements of funds for the appellants utilisation, the court's attention was also drawn to the Letter of Offer (ID5) sub clause (j) which states "The Bank reserves the right to add to, delete, alter, amend and vary any terms and conditions in its absolute discretion at any time it deems fit." The Conditions Precedent were for the benefit of the plaintiff and the plaintiff was entitled to waive them, if it so wished, before the disbursements of the funds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The court was urged to dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> I have considered the submissions in this appeal with some concern as they appear to show an inadequate grasp of matters which may be somewhat elementary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The introduction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;34.;;">O 34 to the Rules of the High Court 1980 (the Rules)</LINK>, the Rules then in force, marks a change from the traditional position under which the progress of a case was largely left in the hands of the parties. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;34.;;">O 34</LINK>, the court, not the parties, now dictate the progress of cases at the pre-trial stage to ensure that the practices and procedures applicable during the respective stages prescribed by the Rules are complied with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The duty of an advocate and solicitor is to assist the court by presenting documentary evidence in the most convenient manner. In preparing for trial it was incumbent upon parties to prepare agreed and non-agreed Bundles of Documents. Bundles are made for the convenience of court and parties to facilitate a speedy trial. Documents crucial to the plaintiff 's claim should be held out. If agreed, to set them out in a proper Bundle and paged in order of date. If not agreed, then copies should be made available, bound and paged in another Bundle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Whilst I agree that strict and slavish adherence to forms and rules can sometimes hinder the administration of justice, one however must also bear in mind that these forms and rules should not be disregarded for no reason whatsoever since they embody the experience of the courts over the years in the course of speedy and efficient administration of justice. Non-compliance precluded a party in breach from tendering the documents except by leave of court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The manner in which the plaintiff's counsel had proceeded to prove their case was certainly in my view extremely unsatisfactory. The filing of not one, but four Supplementary Bundles of Documents long after the period to do so had expired, after four of the plaintiff's witnesses had given their evidence, had rightly been objected to by the defendants' counsel. The introduction of additional Supplementary Bundles of Documents, encls (11), (19), (22) and (24), on a piecemeal and instalment was certainly grossly unfair to the defendants as the defendants had not been given an opportunity to inspect them. The documents listed in Supplementary Bundle of Documents in encls (11), (19), (22) and (24) clearly were disputed documents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> Much time was expended before us in argument on the actual evidence upon which the High Court judgment his decision rests.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> By reason of objection having been taken by the defendants' counsel, the court was in my view obliged to consider the objection raised and to rule thereon. From the record it would appear that the trial judge did not return to the issue of whether to admit/not admit the documents listed in encls (11), (19), (22), and (24). The general rule is that documents not admitted in evidence cannot be relied upon by the trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> There clearly has been an inordinate and inexplicable delay as to why the documents in the Supplementary Bundle of Documents were not introduced earlier. The documents were always in the possession of the plaintiff but did not find it fit to file the same. The plaintiff 's witnesses Azman bin Baharin (PW5), Lee Huan Nee (PW6), Johari Ariff bin Osman (PW7) and Yeap Eng Lock (PW8) testified before the court that all these documents in encls (19), (22), (23) and (24) were available way back in 2003, the year when the case management was held.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Counsel for the plaintiff clearly has not been diligent in preparing the plaintiff 's case. Diligence means earnest and meticulous pursuit towards the attainment of one's goal. The plaintiff 's counsel has, in my considered opinion, adopted a lackadaisical attitude in the preparation of his case and guilty of indolence. The question of denying the plaintiff the right to produce those documents does not arise. The plaintiff has only itself to blame for the predicament it had found itself in. Justice was not only to the plaintiff but also to the defendants. I am of the view that the objection taken by the defendants' counsel should have been sustained. Not having obtained leave of the court, the plaintiff should not have been allowed to introduce additional witnesses as a matter of course, and for such witnesses to refer to the documents listed in the Supplementary Bundles filed at mid-way through trial also as a matter of course.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> I am compelled to conclude that the learned judge had arrived at his decision on evidence the veracity of which remains suspended. The evidence led by additional witnesses by reference to the documents listed in the Supplementary Bundle of Documents must be expunged from the court record. They should not have been taken into consideration. Shorn of these evidence, there was no evidence that the defendants had complied with the Conditions Precedents imposed by the plaintiff, the consequence of the facility either not utilised or the same was withdrawn by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> There are two sets of circumstances under which a defendant may submit that he has no case to answer. There may be such a submission, firstly in a situation where, accepting the plaintiff 's evidence at its face value, no case has been established in law; and in the other, the evidence led by the plaintiff was so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the court should find that the burden of proof has not been discharged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> I am of the view the evidence led by the plaintiff in this case was unsatisfactory. The trial judge should have made a finding that the burden of proof has not been discharged by the plaintiff and that there was no case for the defendants to answer. The learned trial judge accordingly erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> For these reasons the appeal was allowed with costs and the decision of the High Court Judge set aside.</p>
