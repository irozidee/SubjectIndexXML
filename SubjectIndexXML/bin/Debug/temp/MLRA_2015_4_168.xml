    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his conviction and sentence for trafficking in dangerous drugs. The appellant was arrested during a drug raid by the police and was holding a plastic bag at that time. Upon inspecting the plastic bag, the police found two envelopes each containing a slab wrapped with transparent plastic, which were later identified as cannabis ('the drugs'). At the trial, the defendant in his defence denied any knowledge of the drugs found on him. Further, the appellant named three persons ('three named persons') in connection with the drugs found on him, contending that he had been informed by the three named persons that the plastic bag contained money. However, the trial judge found that the appellant's defence was unbelievable and due to the failure of the defence in calling the three named persons, the trial judge invoked an adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950 ('s 114(g)'</LINK>). Consequently, the appellant was found guilty and sentenced to death. In the instant appeal, the main issues to be considered were, amongst others, whether there was actual possession of the drugs; whether the trial judge failed to consider the appellant's defence sufficiently; and whether the trial judge erred in invoking an adverse inference against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal, appellant's conviction and sentence set aside):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In his findings on possession, the trial judge had found that the appellant had actual possession after considering the fact that the appellant had put up a struggle and had to be brought to the ground before the police could arrest him. Therefore, based on the said findings, the appellant had possession of the drugs. (paras 9-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Judges must be reminded not to delve in the "believable and convincing" test in applying the "reasonable doubt" test. It was a well-established principle of Malaysian criminal law that the general burden of proof lay throughout the trial on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused for the offence charged. There was no similar burden placed on the accused to prove his innocence. In this instance, the trial judge found the appellant's defence story to be unbelievable and unconvincing. While it was not wrong to do so, it was still incumbent on his part to consider whether the defence nevertheless had raised a reasonable doubt. The trial judge was still bound to consider the defence, however weak, and to acquit if he was not satisfied that the prosecution had discharged the burden of proof which rested upon it. (paras 19-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant appeal, had the trial judge properly and sufficiently considered the explanation of the appellant in his defence and considered it together with the rest of the evidence available, the probability of the defence story could not just be brushed aside. Being too preoccupied and under the erroneous belief that the appellant was duty bound to prove his case, the trial judge had failed and had totally dismissed the appellant's explanation and, accordingly, the trial judge had committed a serious error of law. (paras 23-24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Generally, in a criminal trial, there was no burden cast on the accused to call witnesses and no adverse inference could be drawn on the failure of the defence to call witnesses. The trial judge in the instant appeal had erred in invoking the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK> on the failure of the appellant to call the three named persons. Although the said general principle was not without exception, the case of <i>Choo Chang Teik &amp; Anor v. PP</i> referred to by the prosecution to support its contention that an adverse inference could be drawn against the appellant was distinguishable on its facts with the instant case and therefore inapplicable. Thus, there was a clear misdirection by the trial judge. (paras 25, 27, 28 &amp; 29)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Balia Yusof Wahi JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged for an offence of trafficking in 1952 grams of cannabis, a dangerous drug under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (DDA)</LINK>. He was found guilty, convicted and sentenced to death by the High Court at Johor Bahru. This is his appeal against the said conviction and sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Acting on information received, a team of police officers from the Narcotics Department of IPK Johor carried out an observation at the roadside in Kampung Melayu Pandan, Johor Bahru, Johor. The appellant was seen walking out from a road junction holding a white plastic bag in his right hand. He was arrested, and upon a search conducted, the white plastic bag was seized. Upon inspecting the bag, the police found two envelopes each containing a slab wrapped with transparent plastic, suspected to be drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> As part of the prosecution's case, SP1, the leader of the team, stated that the appellant tried to run away upon being confronted by the police team and he had to be brought to the ground to effect the arrest. At the same time, some other police personnel raided a house located about 30-50 metres from the place where the appellant was arrested and three other males were arrested. One of them was Abdul Maungni. SP1 however, was not sure that the appellant was arrested as he was coming out of the said house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 22 March 2012 at about 5.45pm, the appellant received a phone call from his friend named Baby Majidee who asked the appellant to accompany him to Johor Bahru for the purpose of buying a car. Baby Majidee came to fetch him and he sat on the front passenger seat of Baby Majidee's car. Along the way, Baby Majidee stopped his car in front of a shop and asked the appellant to go to Abdul Maungni's house to take some money.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The appellant went to Abdul Maungni's house and there, he saw Shasha whom he knew about six months before the arrest. Shasha gave the appellant one plastic bag containing two envelopes and said to the appellant that those envelopes contain the money. Thereafter, the appellant walked back towards Baby Majidee's car. Suddenly he was confronted by three men and was pushed to the ground. Later, he realised they were policemen and he became scared upon being told that the plastic bag contains drugs. At that time, Baby Majidee was nowhere to be seen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant denies any knowledge about the drugs found in the plastic bag which he thought was money as told by Baby Majidee and Shasha earlier. In essence, the appellant's defence is that of an innocent carrier. The Appeal</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In the appeal before us, learned counsel advanced two grounds namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On the issue of possession, the argument of learned counsel is quite simplistic, in that, without knowledge, there can be no possession. The appellant is an innocent carrier. He does not know what was in his possession. To him, it was money as told to him by Baby Majidee earlier and subsequently told by Shasha that the plastic bag contains money for Baby Majidee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In his findings on possession, the learned judge had found that the appellant had actual possession. At p 16 of the Appeal Record, His Lordship stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Earlier, the learned judge had considered the fact that the appellant put up a struggle and he had to be brought to the ground before the police could arrest him. Concluding his findings on the issue of possession, the element of knowledge was dealt with in the following words at p 17 of the Appeal Record:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We agree with the findings made by the learned judge. The appellant had possession of the impugned drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Upon his consideration of the defence, the learned judge had found that the appellant's defence "sukar untuk diterima", "tiada mempunyai asas yang kukuh" and "tiada pembuktian yang konkrit ditampilkan" (see p 25 of the Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The learned judge found that it was just impossible to believe that the appellant only knew the content of the envelope in the plastic bag to be drugs upon being told by the police after his arrest. In His Lordship's view, that defence is a bare denial and bare denial can never be a good defence. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_55;"><i>D A Duncan v. PP</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 55</LINK>, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_5_130;"><i>Rosenizam Maharam v. PP</i> [2002] 5 MLRH 130</LINK>; [2003] 5 MLJ 49).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It would be recalled that three other persons were named by the appellant in his defence, namely: Baby Majidee, Shasha and Abdul Maungni. The existence of these three persons was also not only revealed during the defence case but was brought up as early as when SP1 was called to give evidence. It is not true as submitted by the learned Deputy that these three names only surfaced when SP6, the Investigating Officer, gave evidence. The Alcontara Notice was duly given to the prosecution at the earliest stage of the case. The appellant's version of the roles of Baby Majidee and Shasha was also put to this witness at this stage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> While under cross-examination, SP1 confirmed that the appellant was arrested about 30-50 metres away from the house where three others were also arrested in relation to drug offences. One of them was Abdul Maungni who was arrested in respect of "kes ganja".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> During re-examination by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor, SP1 also testified that Abdul Maungni's house was also targeted arising from the two different informations he received.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> SP6, the Investigating Officer, confirmed that Shasha was also later arrested and charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B of the DDA</LINK> involving the drug cannabis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In addressing his mind to the defence, the learned judge said at p 29 of the appeal record:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> There are two aspects of the learned judge's consideration of the defence that merit our comment. Firstly, judges must again be reminded not to delve in the "believable and convincing" test in applying the "reasonable doubt" test. It is trite that an accused person need only raise a reasonable doubt. This was the reminder given by the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311. The learned judge in the instant appeal found the appellant's defence story to be unbelievable and unconvincing. While it is not wrong for His Lordship to conclude that the defence story is unbelievable/ false and unconvincing, it is still incumbent on his part to consider whether the defence nevertheless has raised a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Secondly, it is a well-established principle of Malaysian criminal law that the general burden of proof lies throughout the trial on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused for the offence with which he is charged. There is no similar burden placed on the accused to prove his innocence. He is presumed innocent until proven guilty. To earn an acquittal, his duty is merely to cast a reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case (per Mohamed Azmi SCJ in <i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor (supra)</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> While it is perfectly proper that a judge may view with suspicion or disbelieve of the defence story, he is still bound to consider the defence was however weak, and to acquit only if he is not satisfied that the prosecution had discharged the burden of proof which rests upon it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It is trite law that the explanation given by an accused has to be considered together with the rest of the evidence in the case and that he will be entitled to an acquittal if as a result of such explanation the existence of a material fact on which the prosecution relied is no longer so probable as to make a prudent man acts upon the supposition that the fact exists (per Augustine Paul J (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_1_764;"><i>PP v. Chia Leong Foo</i> [2000] 1 MLRH 764</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 705; [2000] 4 CLJ 649).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We are of the considered view that had the learned trial judge properly and sufficiently considered the explanation of the appellant in his defence and consider it together with the rest of all the evidence available, the probability of the defence story could not just be brushed aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The three named persons are not fictitious characters. Three others were arrested at a house nearby at about the same time when the appellant was arrested. One of them was Abdul Maungni and he was arrested in respect of 'kes ganja'. Later, Shasha was also arrested and charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B of the DDA</LINK>. And SP1, the leader of the arresting party, confirmed that he received two different informations which led to the arrest of the appellant and Abdul Maungni's home being targeted as part of his mission on that day. Being too preoccupied and under the erroneous belief that the appellant is duty-bound to prove his case, the learned trial judge had failed and had totally dismissed the appellant's explanation. The learned judge had committed a serious error of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Generally, in a criminal trial, there is no burden casts on the accused to call witnesses and no adverse inference may be drawn on the failure of the defence to call witnesses. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1948_1_651;"><i>Goh Ah Yew v. PP</i> [1948] 1 MLRA 651</LINK>,<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1963_1_304;">Abu Bakar v. Regina [1963] 1 MLRH 304</LINK>; [1963] 1 MLJ 288, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1984_2_551;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Tan Gong Wai &amp; Anor</i> [1984] 2 MLRH 551</LINK>; [1985] 1 MLJ 355, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_646;"><i>Illian &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 646</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 421, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1967_1_272;"><i>Tan Foo Su v. PP</i> [1967] 1 MLRH 272</LINK>; [1967] 2 MLJ 19). The learned trial judge in the instant appeal had erred in invoking the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK> provision on the failure of the appellant to call the three named persons. On that ground alone, we ought to allow the appeal. There was a clear misdirection by the learned trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Eusoffe Abdoolcader J (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_438;"><i>PP v. Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris &amp; Ors</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 438</LINK>; [1977] 1 MLJ 180 among others had commented:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor in her submissions in reply had referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_280;"><i>Choo Chang Teik &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 280</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 423; [1991] 1 CLJ 54 in support of her contention that adverse inference may be drawn against the appellant for his failure to call witnesses in support of his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We agree that the said general principle is not without exception and the said case of <i>Choo Chang Teik &amp; Anor v. Public Prosecutor (supra)</i> referred to by the learned Deputy is a clear illustration. We shall now revert to that case. In his defence, the first appellant in the said case stated that he had been beaten by thugs at his friend's house which left him disabled for two years. They have injured his waist. He also produced a certificate of his membership of a handicapped persons' association to prove his contention. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had failed to call his witness to testify that he had been attacked by thugs two years before as a reason for him running away from the scene when the police party raided the house. The learned judge had drawn an adverse inference against him under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> and this was affirmed by the Supreme Court. The prosecution had taken particular issue on the contention of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant that he had been beaten by thugs two years ago. Evidence in rebuttal was introduced by the prosecution showing that the first appellant had told some police officers that he had a fall in his cell which caused his injury.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The distinction which can be drawn in that case is that upon rebuttal evidence being adduced by the prosecution, the onus shift to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant to prove his contention by calling his friend at whose house he was beaten. On his failure to do so, the natural conclusion and inference is that, the proof, if produced, instead of rebutting would sustain the charge, thus attracting the adverse presumption. On that distinction, we found the authority referred to by the learned Deputy to be inapplicable to the facts and circumstances of the instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> For the aforesaid reason, we allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence. The appellant is acquitted and discharged.</p>
