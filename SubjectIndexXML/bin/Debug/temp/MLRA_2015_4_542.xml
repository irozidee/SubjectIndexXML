    <p>The three appellants were accused with cheating SP1. They were initially charged with and tried in the Sessions Court for various offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;420.;;">ss 420</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">109 of the Penal Code ("Code")</LINK>. At the close of the prosecution's case, the prosecution applied to amend the charges against the appellants. The amendment entailed the insertion of common intention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Code</LINK> and the particularisation of the deception. Alternative charges were also preferred against all the appellants. The 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant faced an additional charge. The Sessions Court judge ("the previous Sessions Judge") allowed the amendment of the charges and found that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case on one amended charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, on three amended charges against the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant and on one amended and one additional charge against the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant. The appellants were ordered to enter their defence on the amended charges. The previous Sessions Judge was subsequently transferred and no written grounds were provided for the<i>prima facie</i> case finding. The defence was heard by a new Sessions Judge ("the succeeding Sessions Judge"). All three appellants gave evidence under oath. At the end of the defence case, the succeeding Sessions Judge found that the appellants had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. In her grounds of judgment, the succeeding Sessions Judge stated that since she had been directed to continue at the defence case stage, there was no need for her to re-visit or review the prosecution's case, which had been considered by the previous Sessions Judge in deciding that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellants. The succeeding Sessions Judge convicted and sentenced the appellants to various terms of imprisonment. All three appellants appealed to the High Court. The High Court however affirmed the convictions and the sentences imposed by the succeeding Sessions Judge. The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal. The main grounds of appeal concerned: (i) the amendment of the charges; (ii) the absence of the grounds of judgment by the previous Sessions Judge at the end of the prosecution's case; (iii) the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC")</LINK>; (iv) the error on the part of the succeeding Sessions Judge in failing to reconsider the prosecution's case and in dealing with only the defence case; (v) whether a statement ("exh P97") made by one Raizul incriminating the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> appellants was properly admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act 1950 ("EA")</LINK> notwithstanding failure by the police to use <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;47.;;">ss 47</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;49.;;">49</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;118.;;">118</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;396.;;">396 of the CPC</LINK>; (vi) the subject matter of the charges; and (vii) the credibility of a witness ("SP17") whose evidence was not in favour of the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeals; convictions and sentences affirmed:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Although there were no grounds of judgment written by the previous Sessions Judge to justify the amendments, this court would agree with the findings of the High Court that no prejudice had been occasioned to the appellants. The amendments did not introduce a different case against the appellants and only added the elements of cheating and introduced <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Code</LINK>, based on substantially the same facts. Where the facts do not establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against the accused on the charge preferred against him but discloses another offence for which he is not charged, the court ought to amend the charge unless there is good reason not to do so. <i>PP v. James Tan (refd)</i>; <i>PP v. Jorge Enrique Pellon Tellon (refd)</i>. (paras 32-33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There is no statutory provision requiring a trial judge to prepare grounds of judgment in finding a<i>prima facie</i> case and in calling for the defence. In the instant case, the absence of the grounds of the judgment had not prejudiced the appellants. What was more important at the close of the case for the prosecution was for the accused to know what was it that he had to answer in his defence. It was not the case here that the appellants were prejudiced for not being able to put up their defences properly. <i>Junaidi Abdullah v. PP (refd)</i>; <i>Abdul Hamid Udin v. PP (refd)</i>. (paras 34-35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Where a Magistrate or a Sessions Judge has been transferred to another state, he retains the jurisdiction in the matter and he may continue and complete the cases that he has heard partly. However, to save time and money and to expedite the disposal of part-heard cases, the succeeding Magistrate or Sessions Judge may continue the trial from where the predecessor left. (paras 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>, the succeeding Sessions Judge had a complete discretion to either hear the case de novo or to continue from the point where it had been left-off by the previous Sessions Judge. This court could not agree that the 'directive' given to the succeeding Sessions Judge amounted to a breach of the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261</LINK>. It is a practice for the Chief Judge or the Chief Registrar to decide on whether part-heard cases would be completed either by the previous presiding Magistrate or Sessions Judge or by his successor. This decision or 'directive' is purely administrative and given with the primary purpose to speed up the disposal of part-heard cases. The 'directive', which is given administratively, could not and did not in any way fetter the discretion of the succeeding Magistrate or Sessions Judge provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>. In the circumstances, the 'directive' given to the succeeding Sessions Judge had not prejudiced the appellants and had not breached <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>. (para 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The succeeding Sessions Judge had not considered the defence in isolation but had tested the defence in the light of the case for the prosecution. There was sufficient compliance by the succeeding Sessions Judge with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;173.;;">s 173(m)(i) of the CPC</LINK>. Even if the grounds of the succeeding Sessions Judge were lacking or there was an error on her part for stating that she would only consider the defence, the High Court judge had meticulously examined the evidence of the prosecution for each instance of the cheating. The appellate court may review and reevaluate the evidence and come to its own findings of fact where circumstances warrant. In the instant case, the High Court judge had considered the elements of the offence and had looked at all the evidence in making his findings that both the Sessions Judges were correct in calling for the defence and that the defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case, respectively. The High Court judge was also correct on the issue of common intention. <i>Ahmad Najib Aris v. PP (refd)</i>. (paras 43-46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The non-calling of Rosnani by the prosecution did not create a gap in the prosecution's case, given that there was no dispute as to her identity. The conduct of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant, though subsequent to the deception of SP1 was relevant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;8.;;">s 8 of the EA</LINK>. The High Court judge had correctly made inferences from the acts or conduct of the appellants in coming to the conclusion that the appellants had the common intention to deceive SP1. (paras 52-53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The actions of the police in searching for Raizul at his address, placing an advertisement in the newspapers and seeking the assistance of the Interpol were reasonable efforts taken by the police to trace Raizul. The failure of the police to make use of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;47.;;">ss 47</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;49.;;">49</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;118.;;">118</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;396.;;">396 of the CPC</LINK> did not render the statement of Raizul inadmissible. Exhibit P97 was correctly admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the EA</LINK>. Raizul was an accessory after a fact and could not be an accomplice in the commission of the original offence. The events recorded in his statement were corroborated by SP12 and SP24, notwithstanding the usual corroboration warning. No miscarriage had been occasioned to the appellants by the admission of exh P97. <i>PP v. Lee Jun Ho &amp; Ors (distd)</i>; <i>Kuan Ted Fatt v. PP (refd)</i>. (paras 57 &amp; 59)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The evidence of SP17, on the facts, did not affect the prosecution's case. (para 64)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> On a maximum evaluation of the evidence led by the prosecution, the elements of the offence in the charges had been proved. The High Court judge did not err in his finding that the evidence adduced by the prosecution disclosed a <i>prima facie</i> case for the appellants to answer. The succeeding Sessions Judge had considered the defence as against the evidence of the prosecution in coming to the conclusion that the appellants had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. There was no reason to depart from the findings of the succeeding Sessions Judge and High Court judge that the defences of the appellants did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The necessary inferences drawn from the circumstances, taken cumulatively, were that the appellants were part of and privy to the plan to deceive SP1. (paras 65, 66 &amp; 70)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> There was no doubt that the convictions were safe. The appeals against conviction ought to be dismissed and the order of the Sessions Court as upheld by the High Court ought to be affirmed. (para 71)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> With regard to sentencing, an appellate court should be slow to disturb the sentence passed by the court below unless the sentence was manifestly wrong in the sense of being illegal or being unsuitable to the proved facts and circumstances. In the instant case, the succeeding Sessions Judge had considered both the public interest and the interest of the appellants and had taken into account the age of the appellants; the fact that the appellants were first offenders; that the offence was a serious offence as it involved a big amount of money and that it had implicated the State Government and the Menteri Besar. In deciding on the term of imprisonment, the succeeding Sessions Judge had also considered the fact that the victim could not recover the money and that no punishment of whipping could be imposed on the appellants due to their age. The succeeding Sessions Judge had thus taken into consideration relevant factors in imposing the sentences. Since it had not been shown that the succeeding Sessions Judge had embarked on some extraneous or irrelevant factors in imposing the sentences against the appellants, there was no reason to disturb the sentences imposed by the succeeding Sessions Judge which had been affirmed by the High Court. The sentences were appropriate in the circumstances of the case. <i>PP v. Mohamed Nor &amp; Ors (refd)</i>; <i>Bhandulananda Jayatilake v. PP(refd)</i>; <i>PP v. Dato' Waad Mansor (refd)</i>. (paras 73-75)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> In respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellants, in determining whether the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive, this court was guided by the one transaction rule where the following four elements had to be present, namely: proximity of time, proximity of place, continuity of action and continuity of purpose or design. In the instant appeals, there was no proximity of time and place as the charges related to different dates and places and different purpose. Further, the aggregate sentences did not offend the totality principle. The appeals against the sentences were thus similarly dismissed. <i>Bachik Abdul Rahman v. PP (refd)</i>. (paras 76-77)</p>

      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> These three appeals arose out of the decision of the High Court at Johor Bahru in affirming the convictions and sentences passed by the Sessions Court against the three appellants for the offence of cheating. The original charges against the appellants read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The case for the prosecution may be summarised as follows. Dato' Ding Lian Cheon (SP1), a businessman from Sarawak wanted to buy lands for investment in Peninsular Malaysia. SP1's friend Loi Teck Hui (SP2) informed SP1 about some pieces of land in Johor Bahru. SP1 agreed to buy two pieces of land, namely Lots 21448 and 1142, Jalan Skudai, Johor Bahru. The lands were shown to SP1 by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, a land broker. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant told SP1 that the lands belonged to the State Government of Johor and that SP1 had to pay RM7.5 million to the Menteri Besar on behalf of the State Government plus premium of not more than RM15 per sq foot. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant also informed SP1 that the application must be made in writing to the Menteri Besar. For that purpose the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant gave SP1 a sample letter (P2).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Based on the said sample letter, SP1 prepared an application vide a letter addressed to the Menteri Besar of Johor (exh P3). Exhibit P3 was given to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant where the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant informed SP1 that he will forward the letter to the Menteri Besar. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had also written on a piece of paper (P4), the name of the Menteri Besar, ie Abdul Ghani bin Othman and the identity card number for SP1 to buy a Cashier's Order in the sum of RM6 million. A copy of the Cashier's Order was to be given to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant wanted to see whether SP1 had the money before he could assist SP1 with the application. The Cashier's Order for $S3.45 million in the name as per the particulars given by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was accordingly bought by SP1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Thereafter, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant informed SP1 that the application for the said lands had been approved. On 25 July 1995 when SP1 came to Johor Bahru with SP2 and Chew Kwong Cheong, a valuer (SP4), the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant waited for SP1 at the airport. After sending SP1 to check in at Hotel Hyatt, Johor Bahru, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant proceeded to the then State Secretariat at Bukit Timbalan, Johor Bahru with SP2 and SP4. At Bukit Timbalan, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant fetched the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant who was carrying a briefcase and was dressed in a coat and neck tie. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant got down from his car and had opened the door for the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant. They then met SP1 in his hotel room. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant was introduced by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant to SP1 as the Private Secretary to the Menteri Besar. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant had also introduced himself to SP1 as the Secretary of the Menteri Besar.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In the hotel room, the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant took out a bundle of document from his briefcase. In the presence of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, SP2 and SP4, the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant showed SP1 the file relating to the application for the said lands and informed SP1 that the application had been approved by the State Executive Council (EXCO). The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant then asked for the Cashier's Order. The Cashier's Order was given by SP1 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant who said that he will give it to the Menteri Besar. When asked by SP1 why he needed to pay when the approval had not been formally issued, the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant said that the political party of the Menteri Besar needed the money urgently.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 8 September 1995, the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants went to Sibu to hand over to SP1 the approval letter from Pejabat Tanah dan Galian Johor Bahru dated 6 September 1995 (P6B) for the alienation of the Lots 21148 and 1152, Jalan Skudai, Johor Bahru. Apart from the approval letter, the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant also gave SP1 Form 5A(P7A) for the payment of premium in the sum of RM4,786,095.00. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant however informed SP1 that the State Government had exempted the payment of premium. The sum has to be paid instead to his boss for political purposes. SP1 agreed to pay only RM4 million which was accepted by the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant. It was agreed that the RM4 million will be paid in two instalments, in the sum of RM2 million each instalment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The first payment of the RM2 million in lieu of the premium was made by SP1 on 23 September 1995 at Hyatt Hotel Johor Bahru. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant came to the hotel with a Malay lady, who was introduced to SP1 as the wife of the Menteri Besar. The briefcase containing RM2 million cash was given by SP1 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant who then gave the briefcase to the the wife of the Menteri Besar.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> SP1 was then not very happy with the lease of 99 years and wanted to extend the lease of the said lands to 999 years. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant agreed to assist in extending the lease on payment of RM1 million. The payment of RM1 million was made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant on 5 October 1995 for the purpose of extending the lease. To speed up the application for the extension of the lease, a further payment of RM300,000.00 was made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant on 27 October 1995.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In January 1996, SP1 realised that there was an error in the lot number. Whilst his application was for lot number 21448, the letter of approval (P6B) and Form 5A (P7A) stated the lot number as 21148. Upon checking with the Land Office, SP1 came to know that P6B and P7A were forged documents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> As it turned out, there was no such approval by the EXCO and no letter was issued by the Land Office in respect of the said lands which in fact do not belong to the State Government. The particulars given by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant for the Cashier's Order were not the particulars of the Menteri Besar. One Raizul bin Manap, disguised as "Abdul Ghani bin Othman" had opened the bank accounts in Singapore and Johor Bahru to facilitate the deposits and withdrawals of the monies paid by SP1. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant was not the Secretary to the Menteri Besar and the Malay lady who came with the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant to collect the RM2 million cash was not the wife of the Menteri Besar but the wife of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant. SP1 then informed the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant about the error in the lot number and the false identity card of the Menteri Besar. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant told SP1 that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant would wait for his boss, Dato' Dr Johari (the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant) to come back from outstation to discuss the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> A police report was subsequently lodged by SP1, leading to the police tracing the monies and resulting in the charges being preferred against the appellants as stated above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> At the close of the prosecution's case, the prosecution applied to amend the charges against all the appellants. The amendment entailed the insertion of common intention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> and the particularisation of the deception. Alternative charges were also preferred against all the appellants and as against the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant, there was an additional charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The Sessions Judge (the previous Sessions Judge) allowed the amendment of the charges and found that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case on one amended charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, on three amended charges against the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant and on one amended and one additional charge against the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellants were ordered to enter their defence on the amended charges, which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It appeared in the notes of proceedings that the previous Sessions Judge will provide written grounds for the <i>prima facie</i> case but the grounds of judgment were never written as the previous Sessions Judge was subsequently transferred to the Sessions Court at Butterworth.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The defence case was heard by another Sessions Judge (the succeeding Sessions Judge). All the three appellants gave evidence under oath. The gist of the defence is as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The 1<sup>st</sup> Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant did not deny the meetings between him and SP1 on several occasions including when he introduced the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant to SP1 to discuss the application of the said lands. His defence was that he was merely a land broker and that whatever representation given by him to SP2 in respect of the said lands was based on the representation that was given to him as a broker, by the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant said that he was introduced to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant by the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant and that he merely introduced the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant to SP1 as Mohamed Jhomi and not as the Secretary to the Menteri Besar. He further stated that he had no dishonest intention to deceive SP1 and that SP1 was not deceived by him. There was no inducement from him against SP1 for any payment made to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant did not dispute that he was present during those times stated in the charge against him. His defence was that he was promised RM30,000.00 from Habil (which he had not received until to date) to do certain things and he believed Habil who represented to him that the instructions were taken from the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant stated that he took full instructions from Habil and not the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant further stated that he was asked to meet a billionaire so he was instructed to wear coat and neck tie and that was the first time that he met the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant said he introduced himself as "Mat" the messenger boy or office boy and that he was told by Habil that the wife of the VIP was actually the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's wife but he never saw her there.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant denied the prosecution's case. The fact that his wife, Rosnani bt Abdul Rahman had collected the RM2 million from SP1 was not sufficient to infer that she went to collect the money on his instruction. He stated that he had never met SP1 and that there was no direct evidence to show that he had deceived SP1 which resulted in SP1 parting with the Cashier's Order of S$3.45 million.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Findings Of The Trial Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> At the end of the defence case, the succeeding Sessions Judge found that the appellants failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. In her grounds of judgment, the succeeding Sessions Judge stated that since she had been directed to continue at the defence case, there was no need for her to re-visit or review the prosecution's case, which had been considered by the previous Sessions Judge in deciding that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellants. As such the succeeding Sessions Judge took the approach to only deal with the defence case in her grounds of judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Having found that the appellants had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case, the succeeding Sessions Judge convicted and sentenced the appellants as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal To The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Aggrieved by the decision, the appellants filed an appeal to the High Court against the conviction and sentence. Each of the appellant raised various grounds of appeal in the petition of appeal. They had also raised the following preliminary issues:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The High Court Judge found that the preliminary issues were devoid of merits and ruled against the appellants on those preliminary issues. In respect of the substantive grounds of appeal, the High Court Judge considered the issue whether the previous Sessions Judge was correct in calling for the appellants to enter their defence. Guided by the cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_452;"><i>Junaidi Abdullah v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 452</LINK>; [1993] 3 MLJ 217; [1993] 4 CLJ 201; [1993] 2 AMR 2209, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1969_1_97;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Ma'arif</i> [1969] 1 MLRH 97</LINK>; [1969] 1 MLJ 65 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_58;"><i>Ahmad Najib Aris v. PP</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 613; [2009] 2 CLJ 800, the High Court Judge then undertook the exercise of evaluating the evidence at the end of the prosecution's case. Having done so and having addressed his mind to the elements of the offence in the charges, the High Court Judge found that there was credible evidence to prove the elements and that the previous Sessions Judge was correct to find that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellants and in calling the appellants to enter their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The High Court Judge then proceeded to examine the defence and having analysed the defence as against all the evidence before the court, found that the appellants failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The conviction of the appellants by the succeeding Sessions Judge was thus affirmed. As regards the sentence, the High Court Judge found no reason to disturb the sentences passed by the succeeding Sessions Judge. The sentences were similarly affirmed. Dissatisfied, the appellants filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The main grounds of appeal canvassed by Mr Gobind Singh Deo for the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant (which were adopted by Mr Gooi Soon Seng for the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant and Mr Prakash for the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant) were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The submission also canvassed on whether the High Court Judge was correct to go through the evidence as if he was the trial judge</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The main issues submitted by Mr Gooi Soon Seng for the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant were whether Raizul's statement (exh P97) was properly admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> and whether the subject matter of the charges was corrupt money paid to the Menteri Besar in order for SP1 to obtain the said lands.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant, Mr Prakash had submitted on the credibility of Lim Boey Geok (SP17) whose evidence was not in favour of the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We observed that the grounds of appeal are mainly directed to the <i>prima facie</i> case. Essentially learned counsel for the respective appellants argued that the prosecution had not made out a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>First Issue: The Amendment Of The Charges</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On this issue, it was submitted by Mr Gobind that the amendments were prejudicial to the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant as they sought to introduce a totally different case for the prosecution against him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Insofar as amendment is concerned, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;173.;;">s 173(h)(ii) of the CPC</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We did not lose sight of the fact that there was no grounds of judgment written by the previous Sessions Judge to justify the amendment, but this issue was dealt with by the High Court as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We agree with the above findings of the High Court Judge that no prejudice had been occasioned to the appellants. Looking at the records of appeal, we find that the amendments were in line with the evidence before the court. The amendments do not introduce a different case against the appellants. The amendments sought to add the elements of cheating and to introduce <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>, based on substantially the same facts. The law is settled that where the facts do not establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against the accused on the charge preferred against him but disclose another offence for which he is not charged, the court ought to amend the charge unless there is good reason not to do so (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1983_2_174;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. James Tan</i> [1983] 2 MLRH 174</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 173 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_570;"><i>PP v. Jorge Enrique Pellon Tellon</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 570</LINK>; [1998] 4 MLJ 183; [1998] 4 CLJ 278; [1998] 4 AMR 3709). We therefore find no merits in this ground of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Second Issue: The Absence Of Grounds Of Judgment For The <i>Prima Facie</i> Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> There is no statutory provision requiring a trial judge to prepare grounds of judgment in finding a <i>prima facie</i> case and in calling for the defence (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_452;"><i>Junaidi Abdullah v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 452</LINK>; [1993] 3 MLJ 217; [1993] 4 CLJ 201; [1993] 2 AMR 2209 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_5_465;"><i>Abdul Hamid Udin v. PP</i> [2000] 5 MLRH 465</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 334). The issue of absence of grounds of judgment for the decision at the close of the case of the prosecution would not have arisen in this appeal but for the fact that different Sessions Judges heard the case for the prosecution and the defence. And much has been made out of the fact that the previous Sessions Judge had promised to give written grounds for the <i>prima facie</i> case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We noted Mr Gobind's submission on the point of fair trial and that he was not able to stand up and submit or challenge the findings or reasons for the <i>prima facie</i> case. In our view, the absence of the grounds of the judgment has not prejudiced the appellants. To our mind, what is more important at the close of the case for the prosecution is for the accused to know what is it that he has to answer in his defence. It is not the case here that the appellants were prejudiced for not being able to put up his defence properly. We similarly find this ground of appeal without merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Third Issue: <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">Section 261 Of The CPC</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">Section 261 of the CPC</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It was submitted by Mr Gobind that the transfer of a Sessions Judge from one State to another does not cause her to 'cease jurisdiction in the matter', a pre-requisite which is mandatory for the operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>. In support thereof counsel relied on the decision of Syed Agil Barakbah J in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1978_1_178;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Goh Chooi Guan</i> [1978] 1 MLRH 178</LINK>; [1978] 2 MLJ 169.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We agree with Syed Agil Barakbah J in <i>Goh Chooi Guan (supra)</i> where he opined that a Magistrate ceases to have jurisdiction in a criminal case by his untimely death, retirement or resignation and that the section does not apply in the case of transfer of the Magistrate to another State. We are of the view that where a Magistrate or a Sessions Judge has been transferred to another State, he retains the jurisdiction in the matter and he may continue and complete the cases that he has heard partly. However, to save time and money and to expedite the disposal of part-heard cases, the succeeding Magistrate or Sessions Judge may continue the trial from where the predecessor left.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Coming back to the appeal, the grievance of Mr Gobind arose out of the following grounds of judgment of the succeeding Sessions Judge:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was the submission of Mr Gobind that the succeeding Sessions Judge has the option to either hear the case de novo or to act on the evidence recorded partly by the previous Sessions Judge. The 'directive' given to the succeeding Sessions Judge to take over the matter and to continue at the defence stage, contended learned counsel, is contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We agree that pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>, the succeeding Sessions Judge has a complete discretion to either hear the case de novo or to continue from the point where it has been left by the previous Sessions Judge. However we do not agree that the 'directive' given to the succeeding Sessions Judge amounts to a breach of the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261</LINK>. It has been a practice for the Chief Judge or the Chief Registrar to decide on whether the part-heard cases would be completed either by the previous presiding Magistrate or Sessions Judge or by his successor and this decision or 'directive' was purely administrative, given with the primary purpose to speed up the disposal of the part heard cases. The 'directive' which was given administratively could not and did not in any way fetter the discretion of the succeeding Magistrate or Sessions Judge provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>. The duty remains on the Magistrate or the Sessions Judge to act under the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>. In particular, if the succeeding Magistrate or Sessions Judge acts on the evidence which has been recorded by his predecessor, the right to recall witnesses must be observed. In this appeal, we find no issue on the right of the appellants to recall witnesses. In the circumstances, the 'directive' given to the succeeding Sessions Judge has not prejudiced the appellants and has not breached <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Fourth Issue: Failure Of The Succeeding Sessions Judge To Consider All The Evidence At The End Of The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> There was another issue relating to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the CPC</LINK>. It was on the approach taken by the succeeding Sessions Judge at the end of the defence case where she took the view that she need not reconsider the case for the prosecution. This is apparent from her grounds of judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> It was submitted by Mr Gobind that in failing to consider the whole evidence, the succeeding Sessions Judge seriously misdirected herself, resulting in serious miscarriage of justice to the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We have perused the grounds of judgment of the succeeding Sessions Judge and we noted that at p 445-452 of the Appeal Record vol 2, the succeeding Sessions Judge had tabulated "Ringkasan Pendakwaan" at the end of the 

case for the prosecution. Further, reading the grounds of judgment, we find that the succeeding Sessions Judge had not considered the defence in isolation but had tested the defence in the light of the case for the prosecution (see for example pp 461-462, 477-479, and 488 of the Appeal Record vol 2). In our view there was sufficient compliance by the succeeding Sessions Judge of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;173.;;">s 173(m)(i) of the CPC</LINK> which provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Even if the grounds of the succeeding Sessions Judge is lacking or there was an error on her part for stating that she will only consider the defence, the High Court Judge had meticulously examined the evidence of the prosecution for each instance of the cheating. There were three instances of cheating in this case. The first relates to the Cashier's Order in the value of S$3.45 million, the second and the third instances were in relation to the sum of RM2 million cash and RM1.3 million cash respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In this regard, it was submitted by Mr Gobind that it is wrong for the High Court Judge to look at the evidence as if he was a trial judge. We are not able to agree with learned counsel. In our view, there cannot be a disparity in the powers of an appellate court at different levels in dealing with any error, misdirection or irregularity. Furthermore, an appeal is merely a continuation of proceedings by way of rehearing and where circumstances warrant, the appeal court may review and reevaluate the evidence and come to its own findings of fact (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_58;"><i>Ahmad Najib Aris v. PP</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 613; [2009] 2 CLJ 800).</p>

      <b>[46]</b> We do not wish to reproduce the findings of the High Court Judge, suffice to state that we agree with the findings and the reasons given by the High Court Judge in his analysis of the evidence. The High Court Judge has considered the elements of the offence and has looked at all the evidence in making his findings that both the Sessions Judges were correct in calling for the defence and that the defence has failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case, respectively. We also agree with the High Court Judge on the issue of common intention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Fifth Issue: Common Intention</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In the celebrated case of <i>Mahbub Shah v. Emperor</i> [1945] 46 CrLJ 689, two important observations were made in respect of the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. Firstly, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in furtherance of the common intention of all. If this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone. Secondly, the inference of common intention within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstance of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In this appeal, there is clear involvement of all the appellants in the whole transaction where the role of the each of the appellants had been analysed by the High Court Judge. There is direct evidence against the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants, in particular in the meeting at Hotel Hyatt in Johor Bahru where the Cashier's Order was given by SP1. Both the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellants went to Sibu, where the flight tickets were purchased by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant and both were present at Hotel Tanahmas in Sibu where the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant brought the purported letter of approval to SP1, which resulted in the payment of RM2 million cash to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant. This payment was collected by the wife of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant. There is also clear evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant informed SP1 that the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant was the Private Secretary to the Menteri Besar of Johor and that the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant introduced himself as the Private Secretary to the Menteri Besar of Johor. SP1 stood firm in cross-examination on the above said evidence. In our view, it can reasonably be inferred that the presence and the conduct of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was in concert pursuant to the prearranged plan to deceive SP1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The role of the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant was undeniably clearer. He was the one who brought the file containing the purported EXCO approval for the application of the said lands and he had shown the purported minutes of the EXCO meeting, to SP1. It was the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant who took the Cashier's Order of S$3.45 million from SP1, allegedly to be passed to the Menteri Besar of Johor. It was also the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant who told SP1 that the lease of the said lands could be extended from 99 years to 999 years. And it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant who had represented to SP1 on the various payments to be made in relation to the application for the said lands. In short, the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant was directly involved in getting SP1 to part with the monies forming the subject matter of the charges against him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Although the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant was not present when the monies were given by SP1 to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant, we are satisfied that the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant was part of the plan and privy to the deception on SP1. On the error on the lot number, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant said to SP1 that he needed to wait for his boss Dr Johari (the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant) to return from umrah before the error could be corrected. Why the need to even refer the error to the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant or to wait for the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant if the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant is not part of the scheme to deceive SP1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Further, there was clear evidence from the Bank Officers, Mariana bt Othman (SP12) and Zuraini bt Omar (SP24) as to the involvement of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant in the opening of the bank accounts. The involvement of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's wife in collecting the RM2 million cash and the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's conduct in opening the bank accounts and in getting some of the monies, in our view led to an inference that the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant was indeed involved in the plan to cheat SP1. In particular, we agree with the finding of the High Court Judge that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The evidence of SP1 and SP2 disclosed that at the meeting where Rosnani bt Abdul Rahman collected the RM2 million, she was introduced by the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant as the wife of the Menteri Besar of Johor. Rosnani was not called by the prosecution but she was offered to the defence. In our view, the non-calling of Rosnani by the prosecution does not create a gap in the prosecution's case, given that there was no dispute as to her identity. The fact remains that she had collected the RM2 million and the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant had a fair share in the distribution of the monies cheated of SP1. The conduct of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant, though subsequent to the deception of SP1 is relevant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;8.;;">s 8 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In our view, the High Court Judge had correctly made inferences from the act or conduct of the appellants in coming to the conclusion that the appellants had the common intention to deceive SP1. We agree with the following findings of the High Court:</p>

      <b>Sixth Issue: <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">Section 112</LINK> Statement Of Raizul (Exhibit P97)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Raizul was the person who had disguised as Menteri Besar, Abdul Ghani bin Othman. His statement was recorded by the police under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;112.;;">s 112 of the CPC</LINK> where he had revealed the events surrounding the opening of the bank accounts in Singapore and Johor Bahru and the involvement of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellants in respect of the opening of the accounts. It was submitted that the trial judge fell into error when admitting the statement of Raizul as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> had not been complied with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> According to the investigating officer, ASP Chew Kam Soon (SP30) a subpoena was served on Raizul to attend court and Raizul did attend court once. Due to his failure to attend court on a subsequent date, a warrant of arrest was issued but the warrant could not be executed on him. Raizul could not be traced notwithstanding the following efforts by the police:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Mr Gooi contended that all the efforts were done at the eleventh hour whilst in the midst of the trial and that the prosecution had failed to avail itself of the various provisions in the CPC namely <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;47.;;">ss 47</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;49.;;">49</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;118.;;">118</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;396.;;">396</LINK> on the issuance of warrants and the execution of a bond to ensure the attendance of Raizul in court. Relying on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_5_792;"><i>PP v. Lee Jun Ho &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 5 MLRA 792; </LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 220, Mr Gooi submitted that Raizul is an important witness in this case who can unfold the narratives of the prosecution's case and that the failure of the police to take all reasonable and practicable steps to trace Raizul rendered his statement inadmissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We find the facts in <i>Lee Jun Ho (supra)</i> distinguishable. In Lee Jun Ho, there was not a single proactive effort by the police to procure the attendance of a material, relevant and important eye-witness. The court thus found that the police failed to take all reasonable and practicable steps to trace the witness. In our case, there was a search for Raizul at his address, an advertisement in the newspapers and seeking the assistance of the Interpol. These are reasonable efforts taken by the police to trace Raizul. The failure of the police to make use of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;47.;;">s 47</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;49.;;">49</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;118.;;">118</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;396.;;">396</LINK> does not render the statement of Raizul inadmissible. We find that exh P97 was correctly admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> There was another complaint in respect of exh P97. It was submitted that Raizul was an accomplice and the trial judge had failed to address the law on this point and had thus caused serious miscarriage of justice to the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Raizul's statement exh P97 disclosed that he had no clue why he had to go to the banks and why the accounts had to be opened. He was merely following the instruction of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant, his 'guru silat'. He had no knowledge that SP1 was deceived. In our view, Raizul is an accessory after a fact. Strictly speaking, an accessory after a fact cannot be an accomplice in the commission of the original offence (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_457;"><i>Kuan Ted Fatt v. PP</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 457;</LINK> [1985] 1 MLJ 211; [1985] CLJ 174). Nevertheless, what remains is whether the statement in exh P97 has been corroborated. We find that the events stated by Raizul therein, in particular, in respect of the role played by the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant in opening the accounts, were corrobated by the bank officers, SP12 and SP24. In the circumstances we are of the view that even without the usual corroboration warning, no miscarriage of justice had occasioned to the appellants by the admission of exh P97.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Mr Gooi had further submitted that SP1 knew very well that the monies were corrupt monies paid for political fund. We find this submission to be devoid of any merits. There was no evidence to show that the monies were indeed paid to the political fund of UMNO. What was established by the evidence was that the monies ended up in several bank accounts and distributed among others, the appellants. On the facts, we find this to be a clear case of cheating as the monies were paid by SP1 in consideration of the said lands, which SP1 ultimately failed to obtain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Seventh Issue: The Credibility Of SP17</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Mr Prakash raised the point that the prosecution had led two sets of evidence on the receipt of the monies from Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Singapore. The evidence of Lim Boey Geok (SP17) showed that Habil (who is at large) acted as the introducer for her to open the premier current account and premier saving account at Maybank Larkin, Johor Bahru wherein a deposit of RM3 million was made. This same amount was withdrawn a week later by way of a cash cheque and the cash, according to SP17, was given to Habil.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The evidence of SP17 therefore implicates Habil as the person who was involved in opening the accounts and who received the RM3 million cash. This evidence is at variance with the evidence of the Maybank Officers, Lee Choon Leng (SP16) and Yeow King Siong (SP19). SP16 positively identified the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant as the introducer to SP17 in opening the premier accounts. SP16 stated that he knew the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant because the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's shop was opposite of the bank premises and the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant had an account with the bank. SP19 had also identified the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant in court as the person who had introduced himself as "Johari Mansor" and who had collected the RM3 million cash and who had put the money in a briefcase.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> It was thus submitted for the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant that there was a contradiction in the prosecution's case as SP17 who had given evidence not favourable to the prosecution was never impeached nor treated as a hostile witness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> In our view, the evidence of SP17 does not affect the prosecution's case. We agree with the following finding of the High Court Judge on SP17:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> On a maximum evaluation of the evidence led by the prosecution, we are satisfied that the elements of the offence in the charges have been proved. We are of the view that the High Court Judge did not err in his finding that the evidence adduced by the prosecution disclosed a <i>prima facie</i> case for the appellants to answer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Insofar as the defence is concerned, we find that the succeeding Sessions Judge had considered the defence as against the evidence of the prosecution in coming to the conclusion that the appellants had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The succeeding Sessions Judge and the High Court Judge considered the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's presence and involvement in getting SP1 to prepare the Cashier's Order, his presence together with the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant in Sibu when the purported approval letter was shown to SP1 and his share of the division of the monies where RM1.8 million was deposited into his account three days after the Cashier's Order was given to the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's denial of writing the particulars of Abdul Ghani bin Othman and the identity card number had similarly been considered by the succeeding Sessions Judge and the High Court Judge. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant's explanation on the RM1.8 million credited into his account, purportedly for the joint venture project with the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant had been sufficiently evaluated by both the succeeding Sessions Judge and the High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> As regards the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant, the succeeding Sessions Judge and the High Court found that the defence was merely a bare denial and that he was trying to protect the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant, who was his 'guru silat', his boss and his brother in law. His defence that he introduced himself as the messenger boy or office boy to SP1 was evaluated by the courts below before concluding that the defence was not credible and had not raised a reasonable doubt on the case for the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Similarly, the defence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant had been judicially appreciated by the succeeding Sessions Judge and the High Court Judge. In particular, the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's denial that he was involved in the opening of the bank accounts with Raizul was considered by the courts below in the light of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, namely the bank officers who had no interest in this case. Both the courts below found that the defence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant was a bare denial and had not raised a reasonable doubt on the case for the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> We agree with the analysis of the defence by the succeeding Sessions Judge and the High Court Judge and we find no reason to depart from their findings that the defence of the appellants did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. In our view, the necessary inferences drawn from the circumstances, taken cumulatively, are that the appellants are part of and privy to the plan to deceive SP1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> In considering the issues raised by learned counsel for the respective appellants, we had asked ourselves the question whether on the totality of the evidence, the convictions of the appellants are safe. Without doubt, we find that the convictions are safe. We therefore unanimously dismiss all the three appeals against conviction and we affirm the order of the Sessions Court as upheld by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Sentences</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> For the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, Mr Gooi applied for a bound over or if the court is not with him, for a lenient sentence given that it has been 20 years since the offence was committed and considering that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant is 67 years old. For the 2<sup>nd</sup> appellant who is 62 years old, Mr. Prakash similarly prayed for a bound over under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;294.;;">s 294 of the CPC</LINK>. Mr Prakash further submitted that the sentences should be concurrent rather than consecutive. Mr Gobind for the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant similarly prayed for the sentences to run concurrently as the offences were part of the same transaction involving the same complainant. Both Mr Prakash and Mr Gobind echoed the submissions of Mr Gooi on the fact that the offences were committed 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> It is an established principle that an appellate court should be slow to disturb the sentence passed by the court below unless the sentence is manifestly wrong in the sense of being illegal or being unsuitable to the proved facts and circumstances (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_501;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Mohamed Nor &amp; Ors</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 501</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 200b, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1981_1_304;"><i>Bhandulananda Jayatilake v. PP</i> [1981] 1 MLRA 304</LINK>; [1982] 1 MLJ 83 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_1;"><i>PP v. Dato' Waad Mansor</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 101; [2005] 1 CLJ 421; [2005] 1 AMR 509).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> In these appeals, the succeeding Sessions Judge had considered both the public interest and the interest of the appellants and had taken into account the age of the appellants; the fact that the appellants were first offenders; that the offence was a serious offence as it involved big amount of money and that it had implicated the State Government and the Menteri Besar. In deciding on the term of imprisonment, the succeeding Sessions Judge had also considered the fact that the victim could not recover the money and that no punishment of whipping could be imposed on the appellants due to their age.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> The above factors taken into consideration by the succeeding Sessions Judge are relevant factors in imposing sentence. Since it has not been shown that the succeeding Sessions Judge had embarked on some extraneous or irrelevant factors in imposing the sentences against the appellants, and having considered the submissions of learned counsel for the respective appellants, we find no reason to disturb the sentences imposed by the succeeding Sessions Judge which had been affirmed by the High Court. Further, we are of the view that the sentences are appropriate in the circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> In respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellants, in determining whether the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive, we are guided by the proximity of time, proximity of place, continuity of action and continuity of purpose or design (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_323;"><i>Bachik Abdul Rahman v. PP</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 323</LINK>; [2004] 2 MLJ 534; [2004] 2 CLJ 572; [2004] 3 AMR 429). In these one transaction rule where four elements must be present, that is to say, appeals, we find that there was no proximity of time and place as the charges relate to different dates and places and different purpose and we find that the aggregate sentences do not offend the totality principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> The appeals against sentences are thus similarly dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> In the upshot, the appeals are dismissed and the convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>
