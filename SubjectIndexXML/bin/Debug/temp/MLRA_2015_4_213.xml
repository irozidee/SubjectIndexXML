    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellants entered respective sale and purchase agreements ('SPAs') with the respondent for the purchase of condominium units in Villa Perhentian Condominium, the building of which was under construction. Clause 22(1) of the SPAs provided for delivery of vacant possession within 36 months from the date of the SPAs and cls 22(2) and 24(2) thereof provided for liquidated damages in the event of delay. The respondent subsequently abandoned the construction of the Villa Perhentian Condominium and built another revised high-end condominium in its place and named it "The Saffron", hence rendering the SPAs with the appellants incapable of performance. The appellants rejected the respondent's offers of refund of payments made by them towards their respective purchase of units. The appellants were at all times ready, willing and financially capable of continuous performance of their respective contractual obligation under the SPAs. The appellants as plaintiffs then brought an action for specific performance and/or damages in lieu thereof for breach of the SPAs. The High Court dismissed the appellants' claim for specific performance and awarded compensatory damages of RM120,000 for the respective SPAs as a more appropriate remedy. The High Court also ordered the respondent to refund payments made by the appellants towards their purchase, apart from interests and costs of RM40,000. The appellants now appealed, amongst others, against the order of damages in the sum of RM120,000 and that it be substituted with the amounts for liquidated and ascertained damages. The main issue was whether the award of damages could be made after the claim for specific performance was dismissed in view of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">ss 18</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">28 of the Specific Relief Act 1950 ('the Act')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was no conflict between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">ss 18</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">28 of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">Section 28</LINK> applied where the suit was only for specific performance. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">Section 28</LINK> did not apply to restrict <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18</LINK> which specifically authorised any person suing for specific performance to seek compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution for, its performance. It followed that the appellants, having prayed for damages, were entitled to consideration for damages even if their prayer for specific performance was dismissed. Further, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18(5) of the Act</LINK> provided that the jurisdiction conferred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18</LINK> might be exercised notwithstanding that the contract, as in the present case, had become incapable of performance. (paras 14-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> A court should not be deterred from awarding a sum as damages merely because it appeared colossal. Moreover, the court must assess the damages in accordance with law and established principles. It could not rewrite a contract itself so that the damages became affordable to a defendant. A party not in breach was entitled to damages that the party was entitled to under the law. The appellants were entitled to refuse refund of payments made and seek what was due under the SPAs. However, a plaintiff was under a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent upon a defendant's wrong. The appellants could have taken steps to mitigate their losses when it became certain that the Villa Perhentian Condominium was not merely suspended but would not be completed at all. In the absence of evidence as to when the appellants became aware of the suspension and incompletion thereof, the best available evidence would be the date that the respondent had made the offer to refund the payments made by the appellants. This applied in respect of the period for which liquidated and ascertained damages for delay was payable. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The SPAs became incapable of performance through no fault or breach of the appellants. No evidence was adduced as to why after the recovery from the global financial crisis, the suspended Villa Perhentian Condominium could not be revived. Instead, the respondent elected to launch the Saffron condominium. In reality, the respondent must have chosen to breach the SPAs with the appellants. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18(5) of the Act</LINK>, the court was clearly not precluded from awarding damages, and pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18(2)</LINK>, in the circumstances of impossibility, specific performance ought not be granted. However, as there was a contract between the parties that was breached by the respondent, the appellants were entitled to compensation. The court must award compensation accordingly <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance. (para 19)</p>
    <p>[The High Court order of damages in the sum of RM120,000 for the respective SPAs was set aside and substituted with liquidated and ascertained damages pursuant to cls 22(2) and 24(2) of 36 months from date of SPA with interest; general damages with interest from date of judgment till date of settlement; order for return of deposits affirmed with interest; costs in the sum of RM10,000; and deposit to account of costs.]</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants, Balbeer Singh Karam Singh and six others, appealed to this court against the decision of the High Court made on 29 May 2012 in respect of their claim against the respondent company Sentul Raya Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In their statement of claim, the appellants as plaintiffs had sought the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The Draft Order showed the High Court had ordered that:</p>

      <b>[4]</b> The background facts of this case may be summarised as follows:</p>

      <b>[5]</b> Upon that background, the parties proceeded to argue that:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In its grounds of judgment, the High Court took into consideration and reasoned, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions For Appellants</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In the appeal, the point was made for the appellants that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Accordingly, it was prayed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The above prayers at the appeal made it clear that the appellants accepted the dismissal of their prayers for specific performance, special damages and exemplary damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions For The Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the light of the above, it is necessary only to consider that part of the submissions for the respondent in reply and on the respondent's cross-appeal, on the issues whether:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In the submissions on the above, the point made for the respondent may be summarised as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Our Reasoning And Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On the other hand <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18 of the same Act</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In our view, there is no conflict between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">s 28</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">Section 28</LINK> applies where the suit is only for specific performance, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;28.;;">s 28</LINK> does not apply to restrict <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18</LINK> which specifically authorises any person suing for specific performance to seek compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution for, its performance. In the instant appeal, the appellants had sought the reliefs referred to in para 2 above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We hold, therefore, that the appellants, having prayed for damages, are entitled to consideration for damages even if their prayer for specific performance was dismissed. Further, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18(5)</LINK> provides that the jurisdiction conferred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18</LINK> may be exercised notwithstanding that the contract, as in this case, had become incapable of performance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Counsel for the respondent submitted upon the concern that the appellants were keeping their respective SPAs alive in order to reap benefit from the liquidated ascertained damages. Counsel relied upon <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2003_4_69;"><i>Leong Lai Kuen v. Sentul Murni Sdn Bhd</i> [2003] 4 MLRH 69</LINK>; [2004] 5 CLJ 25; [2003] 6 AMR 481, where the headnotes state as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We do not think that a court should be deterred from awarding a sum as damages merely because it appears colossal. More to the point is that the court must assess the damages in accordance with law and established principles. It cannot rewrite a contract itself so that the damages becomes affordable to a defendant. A party not in breach is entitled to damages that the party is entitled to under the law. The appellants were entitled to refuse refund of deposits or payments made and seek what is due under their respective SPAs. However, it is a settled principle that a plaintiff is under a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent upon a defendant's wrong. In this case, the appellants could have taken steps to mitigate their losses when it became certain that the Villa Perhentian Condominium was not merely suspended but would not be completed at all. When the appellants became aware of it is only known to them. In the absence of evidence when they became aware, the best available evidence is the date of the last offer to them to refund the payments they had made, ie 26 July 2002. This applies in respect of the period for which liquidated ascertained damages for delay are payable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As to the rate for liquidated ascertained damages, the terms of the SPAs were not dictated by the appellants, but, including the term as to the rate for liquidated ascertained damages, was from the respondent. Whether the rate was too high has not been raised in issue by either party. Hence, it does not call for consideration of the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;75.;;">s 75 Contracts Act 1950</LINK> as in <i>Leong Lai Kuen v. Sentul Murni Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>. We bear in mind the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in <i>Cukurova Finance International Limited &amp; Cukurova Holdings AS v. Alfa Telecom Turkey Limited</i> [2013] UKPC 20 in relation to submissions as to a high rate of interest:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As to specific performance, quite obviously the respective SPAs have become incapable of performance through no fault or breach of the appellants. No evidence was adduced why, after recovery from the global financial crisis, the suspended Villa Perhentian Condominium could not be revived. Instead, the respondent elected, in 2006, to launch "The Saffron". In a real sense, the facts show that the respondent chose to breach the SPAs with the appellants. Clearly, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18(5) of the Act</LINK>, the court is not precluded from awarding damages, and pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18(2)</LINK>, holding that in the circumstances of impossibility specific performance ought not to be granted, but that there being a contract between the parties which has been broken by the respondent and that the appellants are entitled to compensation for that breach, the court must award compensation accordingly <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance. It is appropriate, in the circumstances, that such compensation be assessed by the deputy registrar of the High Court by comparison with an average market values of comparable units in the vicinity and deducting therefrom the purchase price under the SPAs in each case. We are mindful that the appellants paid 30%, but they were not the parties in breach. Further, there is no evidence that they are in any difficulty to make payment had the Villa Perhentian Condominium been completed and delivered as agreed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We, therefore, in respect of the appeal and cross-appeal order that:</p>
