    <p>The 1st respondent - an advocate and solicitor - had acted for a client in a sale and purchase transaction. He wrongly retained and/or utilised some RM245,000 belonging to his client, obtained as fruits of the transaction. His client lodged a complaint with the Disciplinary Board ("DB") of the Bar Council, which appointed a Disciplinary Committee ("DC") to investigate and submit a report to the DB. The DC found there was sufficient merit in the complaint and recommended that the 1st respondent be suspended for three months. The DB disagreed with such recommendation and instead ordered the 1st respondent to refund the sum of RM245,000, and struck him off the Roll of Advocates and Solicitors of the High Court of Malaya ("Roll"). The 1st respondent appealed to the High Court which set aside the order of the DB and substituted instead an order for three months suspension as ordered by the DC. The Bar Council appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal and reinstating the striking off order:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court had interfered with the DB's order without any basis. The High Court in substituting a lesser punishment did not give any reasons at all for adopting such cause. The right to receive a reasoned judgment from a court of law is an essential fair trial right in both criminal and non-criminal cases. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It is only in rare and exceptional circumstances that a court should interfere with the discretion exercised by the DB in a disciplinary decision involving an advocate and solicitor. (paras 20-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Integrity is the fundamental quality of any person who seeks to practice as a member of the legal profession. There can be little doubt that the public confidence in the administration of justice and trust in the legal profession will be eroded by disreputable conduct of an individual practitioner. (para 25) </p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Dishonesty is not the only situation which will warrant striking an advocate and solicitor off the Roll. An advocate and solicitor may be struck off even in the absence of dishonesty if he is shown to have fallen below the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness. In the instant case, the 1st respondent's conduct clearly fell below the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness required of an advocate and solicitor and his conduct warranted an order that he be struck off the Roll.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Antecedents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> For ease of reference, we would refer to the parties by their first names.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This appeal by Bar Council Malaysia ("Bar"), as intervener at the High Court, is directed against a judgment of the High Court at Alor Setar, Kedah (Zakiah Kassim JC presiding), setting aside an order of Disciplinary Board ("DB") dated 23 June 2011 that Mohd Fadli Shuib ("Mohd Fadli") be struck off the Roll of the Advocates and Solicitor of the High Court of Malaya and substituting for an order for three month's suspension.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The DB's order that Mohd Fadli to refund the sum of RM245,000.00 to the Md Zaini bin Mohd Nor ("Md Zaini") within three months from the date of the order was affirmed by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The facts of the case are simple and straightforward. Md Zaini is the director of Alor Setar Jasa Sepakat Sdn Bhd ("ASJS"). On 10 April 2004, ASJS entered into a sale &amp; purchase agreement ("SPA") for the following properties:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The SPA was prepared by Messrs Khairil &amp; Co where Mohd Fadli is the partner of the firm and the solicitor who handled the matter. The salient terms of the SPA are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In April 2005, the three lots were sold to a third party. It was agreed that the sum of RM50,000.00 will be paid to ASJS and the sum of RM25,000.00 will be advanced to Pembinaan LS Sepakat Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In May, 2005, when the transfer of the three lots were completed, ASJS discovered that the total sum of RM75,000.00 was paid to Mohd Fadli's firm as stakeholders. Mohd Fadli's firm only paid RM25,000.00 from the RM50,000.00 owed to ASJS. There remains an outstanding sum of RM25,000.00. There is also outstanding sum of RM220,000.00 being the balance of the purchase price from the sale of land in Kota Setar, Kedah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Md Zaini lodged a complaint to DB. Md Zaini's case was based on two cheques which has been paid into the firm's client account but never paid to the Md Zaini's company, ASJS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The first cheque was for a sum of RM220,000.00 due to ASJS for SPA in respect of land known as Lot 52867, Mukim Teluk Kechai, Daerah Kota Setar Kedah. Messrs Oo Gin Sun, Bakar &amp; Co, who acted for the purchaser, paid the said sum to the firm's client account in August 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Mohd Fadli did not pay the said sum to Md Zaini's company, ASJS. As such, Md Zaini caused a letter to be sent to Messrs Khairil &amp; Co, requesting for the payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> By a letter dated 24 October 2007, Mohd Fadli sent a post-dated cheque for RM245,000.00 in the name of Md Zaini's deceased father. Md Zaini returned the cheque to Mohd Fadli and requested him to make payment into two cheques in the sum of RM220,000.00 and RM25,000.00 respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> By a letter dated 25 November 2007, Md Zaini requested Messrs Khairil &amp; Co to pay the sums due to ASJS. After several reminders, Mohd Fadli sent a post-dated cheque of RM220,000.00 made out to ASJS on 28 February 2008. The cheque was paid into Maybank on 5 May 2008 but was returned with remark "effect not cleared".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The DB appointed the Disciplinary Committee ("DC") to investigate and submit a report to the DB on the complaint. After its investigation, the DC found that there was sufficient merit on the complaint and recommended that Mohd Fadli be suspended for three months. The DB disagreed with the recommendation of the DC. The DB, upon hearing Mohd Fadli and his counsel, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103D.;;">s 103D(2) of the Legal Profession Act 1976</LINK>, ordered that Mohd Fadli refund the sum of RM245,000.00 to Md Zaini and be struck off the Roll of Advocates and Solicitors of the High Court of Malaya.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Dissatisfied, Mohd Fadli filed an originating motion appealing against the decision to the High Court. The only ground advanced by Mohd Fadli before the High Court was that the DB erred in enhancing the punishment recommended by the DC who had conducted the inquiry and heard the evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The High Court agreed with the submission and set aside the order made by the DB and substituted for an order for three month's suspension as recommended by the DC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Parties' Respective Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The Bar submitted that the High Court had committed an error of law in inferring with the order of the DB without any basis. It was the contention of the Bar that Mohd Fadli had committed a serious and grave misconduct which tarnished the integrity of the legal profession itself. As such, the DB had correctly struck him off the Roll of Advocates and Solicitors of the High Court Malaya.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In reply, Mohd Fadli contended that the order of the DB was not proportionate to the misconduct committed. Striking off Roll of Advocates and Solicitors is the most serious punishment that can be imposed and should be reserved for an act of serious misconduct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We agree with the Bar's submission that the High Court had interfered with the DB's order without any basis. It was apparent from the judgment that the High Court in substituting for a lesser punishment did not give any reasons at all for adopting such cause.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In our opinion, the right to receive a reasoned judgment from a court of law is an essential fair trial right in both criminal and non-criminal cases. Reasoned decisions are required for several reasons: for the affected litigant to be able to know that his or her arguments have been properly examined, but also for the appellant to be able to lodge a reasoned appeal and to enable public scrutiny of judicial decisions. Reasoning, therefore, contributes to better acceptance by the parties of the outcome of a dispute, reduces room for arbitrariness, and increases legal certainty. Generally speaking, the quality of a judicial decision largely depends on the quality of its reasoning. However, the extent of the reasoning that is needed in each case depends on the nature and circumstances of the case in question. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_664;"><i>Hairie Mahthinem v. PP</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 664</LINK>; [2011] 8 CLJ 625, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_2_610;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v.

    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It is accepted that it is only in rare and exceptional circumstances that the court should interfere with the discretion exercised by the DB in a disciplinary decision involving an advocate and solicitor. This principle has been applied consistently by our courts. Hashim Yeop A Sani J (as he then was) in the Federal Court decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_461;"><i>Keith Sellar v. Lee Kwang And Tennakoon v. Lee Kwang</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 461</LINK>; [1980] 2 MLJ 191 had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_208;"><i>Gana Muthusamy v. Tetuan LM Ong &amp; Co</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 208</LINK>; [1998] 3 MLJ 341; [1998] 4 CLJ 878; [1998] 4 AMR 3391, Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> There is a long list of authorities in major common law jurisdictions in support of this principle. In <i>Merchant v. Law Society of Saskatchewan</i> [2002] 8 WWB 214, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, Canada, held at para 18:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is well settled that the duty and responsibility to discipline members for conduct unbecoming is rooted in the public interest and legal profession's duty to protect the public. Iacobucci J, wrote these words in <i>
Pearlman v. Law Society (Manitoba)</i> [1991] 2 SC R 869:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We endorse and accept the above observation and unhesitatingly adopt it as a principle applicable to the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In our opinion, integrity is the fundamental quality of any person who seeks to practice as a member of the legal profession. There can be little doubt that the public confidence in the administration of justice and trust in the legal profession will be eroded by disreputable conduct of an individual practitioner. Master of Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, said in<i> Bolton v. Law Society</i> [1994] 2 All ER 486 at 492:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the factual matrix of the case, we agree with the finding of the DB that the manner in which Mohd Fadli managed the monies received were seriously wrong and amounted to grave misconduct and further the said sum due and owing to Md Zaini have been wrongly retained and/or utilised by Mohd Fadli.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We are mindful that the punishment of striking off the Roll of the Advocates and Solicitors is the most serious punishment that can be imposed. Mohd Fadli pleaded for leniency on the grounds that there was an error of judgment on his part and Md Zaini, the complainant, was his own stepbrother. The cheques were issued to the stepfather to assist his stepfather in his business. The stepfather took care of him since four years ago. Therefore, there was no dishonesty on his part.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We are not persuaded. Dishonesty is not the only situation which will warrant striking out an advocate and solicitor off the Roll. An advocate and solicitor may be struck off even in the absence of dishonesty if he is shown to have fallen below the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness. In the oft-cited decision of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in the English Court of Appeal case of <i>Bolton v. Law Society (supra)</i> at 518:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In similar vein, the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>Adams v. Law Society (Alberta)</i> 11 WWR 288 (AB CA) had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Our evaluation of the case brings us to the same conclusion as was reached by the DB. Mohd Fadli's conduct clearly fell below the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness required of an advocate and solicitor and his conduct warranted an order that he be struck off the Roll.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court. The order of striking off the Roll of the Advocates and Solicitors of the High Court of Malaysia made by the DB is reinstated. We make no order as to costs. Deposit is refunded to the appellant.</p>
