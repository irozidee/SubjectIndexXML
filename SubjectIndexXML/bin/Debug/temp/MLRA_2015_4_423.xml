    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the dismissal of his action against the respondents for the tort of conspiracy to injure. The appellant was the judgment creditor of the 1st respondent company and when the 1st respondent failed to pay the judgment sum concerned, the appellant served the 1st respondent with a statutory notice for winding up. It was the appellant's complaint that the respondents then induced the appellant to withhold the winding up proceedings on the ground that the judgment sum would be settled in due course, during which time the 1st respondent sold and transferred its only landed asset to the 2nd respondent that should have been made available to the appellant as the 1st respondent's creditor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>(1) The evidence established that the respondents had induced the appellant to delay the winding up proceedings and in the crucial time complained of, the 1st respondent had transferred its land to the 2nd respondent, thereby preventing the appellant from proceeding with the winding up proceedings. The winding up proceedings would serve no meaningful purpose as the only landed asset of the 1st respondent was transferred to the 2nd respondent. As the respondents took active steps to delay the appellant from proceeding with the winding up proceedings which created a wrongful loss to the appellant, their conduct attracted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;10.;;">s 10 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. (para 13(2))</p>
    <p>(2) The learned judge had arbitrarily dismissed the action due to the appellant's delay in enforcing the judgment despite taking into consideration all the relevant facts and reasons for the delay. In consequence, it had resulted in a perverse judgment. This was not a case where the appellant delayed in enforcing the judgment but where the 1st respondent had represented that the judgment sum would be settled once the "white knight" had saved the defunct 1st respondent company, during which time the land was transferred to the 2nd respondent. Although the appellant issued the winding up notice after the lapse of six years, the judgment was valid for 12 years under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Limitation Act 1953</LINK>. However, any execution after the six-year period, depending on the mode of execution, might require leave of court. In the present case, there was no reason for the court to grant leave to proceed with winding up proceedings if leave was necessary as the enforcement of the judgment was delayed in consequence of the representation that was made. (para 13(3)-(4))</p>
    <p>(3) A judgment debtor, whether insolvent or solvent, could dispose of the judgment debtor's assets to <i>bona fide</i> purchasers if there was no restriction in law. A creditor could not complain that the disposal had affected his rights <i>per se</i>. However, when such disposal attracted a complaint of conspiracy and the tort of "conspiracy to injure", relief ought to be granted on established legal principles. (para 14)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/plaintiff appeals against the decision of the High Court Judge for dismissing its claim based on the tort of 'conspiracy to injure' against the 1st and 2nd respondents/defendants jointly, and severally came up for hearing on 30 March 2015. Upon hearing we reserved judgment. My learned sister Badariah Sahamid JCA and learned brother Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminary</b>

      <b>[2]</b> Before we set out the brief facts of the case it must be noted that:</p>

      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To Conspiracy And The Tort Of Conspiracy To Injure</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b>
      <i>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</i> - 7th edn, defines conspiracy as 'a secret plan by a group of people to do something harmful or illegal'. To support criminal or civil liability, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950 (EA 1950)</LINK> recognises the issue of conspiracy as relevant and admissible evidence based on a low threshold of 'reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired'. Once evidence is introduced as to the nexus of the parties involved in the subject matter of the dispute, the court is obliged to consider the facts and relevant circumstances to ascertain whether it was a genuine transaction or whether it has element of civil or criminal wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b>
      <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;10.;;">Section 10 of EA 1950</LINK> states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The ingredients of the section are set out in <i>Janab's Key to Law of Evidence</i>, 3rd edn (Revised by Dato' Mah Weng Kwai) at p 280 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The jurisprudence relating to 'conspiracy' is set out at pp 276 and 277 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The English position as well as the essential ingredients to make out a case of conspiracy is set out in <i>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacobs: Precedents of Pleadings</i> (13th edn) at pp 220-221 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the facts of the instant case, it is abundantly clear that the conduct of the 1st and 2nd respondents through Amir Hussain as well as the common solicitor by conduct as well as correspondence clearly will attract <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;10.;;">s 10 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. The learned trial judge had failed to consider the said section and its relevance to the facts of the case. In consequence, the integrity of the decision making process has been compromised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The tort of conspiracy to injure was discussed <i>in extenso</i> by the House of Lords in <i>Quinn v. Leathem</i> [1901] UKHL 2 relating to a case of economic tort. Lord Macnaghten asserted that liability in tort may arise when there is a violation of legal right to interfere with contractual relations recognised by law if there be no sufficient justification for its interference. In <i>Lonrho Ltd v. Shell Petroleum Co Ltd</i> [1982] AC 173, Lord Diplock had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It is also well settled that in the absence of an express admission of a conspiracy, an agreement to injure has to be established in the vast majority of cases by circumstantial evidence. In <i>State of Tamil Nadu v. Nalini</i> [1999] AIR SC 2640, the Indian Supreme Court on the facts had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In <i>R Balakrishna Pillai v. State</i> [1996] Cri LJ 757, the Kerala High Court on the facts had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> What is important to note from the cases such as <i>Quinn</i> and/or <i>Lonrho</i> is that the category of 'actionable wrong' are not closed and will stand as a developing subject to provide relief to persons who are wronged. It is also well established the tort of conspiracy can be in many forms. It will be triggered if justice is perverted and victim of the tort suffers damage. Learned authors of Ramaswamy Iyer's '<i>The Law of Torts</i>, 10th edn at p 515, had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And at p 516 say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> As to the issue of quantum of damages, taking into consideration the 2nd respondent did not oppose the action by giving evidence or both the respondents did not deal with the issue of quantum or oppose the quantum in the submission in the High Court, we take the view the judgment sum of RM4,344,571.00 with interest at 5% per annum from the date of filing of the writ until the realisation of the judgment sum will be an appropriate order on the facts and rules of pleadings and procedure in the instant case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have read the appeal record and the able submissions of the parties. After much consideration to the submissions of the learned counsel for the respondents, we are of the considered view that the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In abundance of caution, we must say that a judgment debtor whether insolvent or solvent can dispose of the judgment debtor's assets to <i>bona fide</i> purchasers if there is no restriction in law. A creditor cannot complain that the disposal has affected his rights <i>per se</i>. However, when such disposal is done to attract a complaint of conspiracy as well as tort of 'conspiracy to injure' as in the instant case and on its special facts the court is obliged to grant the relief based on established legal principles which had been dealt with earlier. A useful read to distinguish a wrong and right in this area of jurisprudence is found at pp 283 and 284 of Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal on '<i>The Law of Torts</i>' 21st edn, where the learned authors say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> For reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed. The 1st and 2nd respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay damages to the appellant in the sum of RM4,344,571.00 with interest at 5% per annum from the date of filing of writ until full realisation of the judgment sum, with costs. The 1st respondent to pay costs of RM30,000.00 and the 2nd respondent to pay costs of RM50,000.00 to the appellant. The judgment of the High Court is set aside. Deposit refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
