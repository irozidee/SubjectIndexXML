    <p>The appellant was the registered owner of a piece of land ("the land"). The 3rd respondent issued a "Notis Kemasukan" dated 2 August 2008 under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(2) of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 ("the 1990 Act")</LINK> to acquire a right of way over a part of the land to construct a transmission line. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(4) of the 1990 Act</LINK>, the appellant by letter dated 15 September 2008 objected to the alignment of the right of way proposed by the 3rd respondent and instead made a proposal for the realignment by offering an alternative route. The 1st respondent, by an order dated 4 December 2008, dismissed the appellant's objection to the 3rd respondent's alignment and further dismissed the realignment proposal. The appellant appealed to the 2nd respondent which allowed the appellant's appeal and re-aligned route proposal. Pursuant to an inquiry on 8 September 2010, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16(1) of the 1990 Act</LINK>, the 1st respondent ordered the 3rd respondent to pay compensation in the sum of RM1,465,968.707. The appellant appealed to the 2nd respondent against the 1st respondent's award. The 2nd respondent varied the award by increasing it to RM2,931,937.50. The appellant, dissatisfied with the assessment process employed by the 2nd respondent, applied to the High Court for judicial review, but its application was dismissed by the High Court. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Although the decision of the 2nd respondent was final, the appellant had a right to resort to the supervisory jurisdiction of the court to examine the decision of the 2nd respondent as to whether there was illegality, procedural impropriety or irrationality. However, it was not the appellant's case that there was illegality or procedural impropriety and thus the only foundation for judicial review that remained was irrationality. The appellant had to demonstrate that the error in the decision was so incapable of explanation that it could only be termed irrational. (paras 21-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the appellant did not lose the land as in an acquisition, but only as to the use of the land for agriculture. The appellant had failed to demonstrate that the loss of use for its land for agricultural purposes amounted to such a higher loss that the lower amount awarded could not be explained. (para 24)</p>

    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The applicant Salak Land Development Sdn Bhd ("the appellant") had applied for the remedies, <i>inter alia</i>, of <i>certiorari</i>, <i>mandamus</i>, declarations and injunctions under judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(2) of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> in respect of the decision of the 2nd respondent Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Selangor ("the 2nd respondent") made on 14 July 2011, awarding the appellant compensation in the sum of RM2,931,937.50 and dismissing "tuntutan pampasan bagi tanah sterile, tanah terasing dan zon penampan" under an appeal by the appellant pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16(2) of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 ("the 1990 Act")</LINK> against the decision of the 1st respondent Pentadbir Tanah Kuala Langat ("the 1st respondent") under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16(1)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 3rd respondent, Tenaga Nasional Berhad ("the 3rd respondent") had issued a "Notis Kemasukan" (First Schedule Notice) dated 22 August 2008 under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(2) of the 1990 Act</LINK> to the appellant, the registered owner of a land held under Hakmilik HS(D) 5289, Lot No PT 8959, Mukim Tanjung Dua Belas, Daerah Kuala Langat, Selangor Darul Ehsan, to acquire a three chain wide right of way over a part of the land to construct a 275kV Loop In Loop Out Transmission Line from Olak Lempit Hicom to Bukit Baja Main Intake Substation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(4) of the 1990 Act</LINK>, the appellant by letter dated 15 September 2008, objected to the alignment proposed by TNB in the said First Schedule Notice dated 22 August 2008 and made a proposal for the realignment of the same by offering an alternative route over the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The 1st respondent conducted an inquiry under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(7) of the 1990 Act</LINK> on 4 December 2008. It made a Second Schedule order wherein the appellant's objection to the 3rd respondent's alignment and the appellant's realignment proposal was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The appellant appealed to the 2nd respondent and by letters dated 6 May 2009 and 5 August 2009, the parties were informed that the 2nd respondent had allowed the appellant's appeal and that the 3rd respondent was to realign its rentice in accordance to the route proposed by the appellant. Pursuant to an inquiry on 8 September 2010, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16(1) of the 1990 Act</LINK>, the 1st respondent ordered the 3rd respondent to pay compensation in the sum of RM1,465,968.707. The appellant appealed to the 2nd respondent against the 1st respondent's award. The 2nd respondent varied the award by increasing it to RM2,931,937.50. The appellant's application for judicial review of the decision by the 2nd respondent was dismissed by the High Court on 17 February 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions For The Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant's complaint was directed at the assessment process employed by the 2nd respondent. It was submitted that it was flawed, failed to take into account relevant factors, and wholly unreasonable. It was submitted that the High Court erred in dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review in that it failed to appreciate that the 2nd respondent failed to take into consideration relevant factors and misconstrued the applicable sections of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;;">1990 Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Shorn of the redundant language, the point made was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The reference by the appellant to Land Acquisition Act arose from <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_351;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Bhd v. Tekali Prospecting Sdn Bhd</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 351</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 707; [2002] 3 CLJ 624; [2002] 3 AMR 3082 where the Court of Appeal addressed <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11 of the 1990 Act</LINK>. The submission proceeded to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>, the book <i>Principles of Statutory Interpretation</i> by Guru Prasanna Singh, 11th edn, 2008 at p 133, and came back to that:</p>

      <b>[9]</b> The submission went back to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The submission for the appellant also addressed the question raised by the 3rd respondent whether the compensation awarded can be questioned by way of a judicial review application. It was submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The 2nd respondent had raised the argument that public policy demanded that the deliberations of the 2nd respondent in respect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16(2)</LINK> is barred by the need for secrecy. It was submitted, relying on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_112;"><i>BA Rao &amp; Ors v. Sapuran Kaur &amp; Anor</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 112</LINK> and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_407;"><i>See Kok Kol v. Chong Kui Seng &amp; Ors &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 407</LINK>; [2010] 2 CLJ 481 that the High Court erred to have said that public policy demands that the decision of the 2nd respondent not be reviewed on account of it being secret without any evidence being presented. The appellant sought to distinguish <i>Ismail Abdullah v. Tenaga Nasional Bhd (supra)</i> on the ground that the Court of Appeal did not have the benefit of the decision of the Federal Court in <i>BA Rao</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reasoning And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appeal before this court was in respect of the dismissal by the High Court of an application for judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It must never be overlooked that judicial review is about the exercise of a supervisory jurisdiction of the court as distinct from its appellate jurisdiction. appellate jurisdiction concerns appeals from the courts in whom is placed judicial authority. Appellate jurisdiction may also extend to the decisions of an authority, body or person if the legislation provides that an appeal therefrom lies to the court. But where a power or discretion is assigned to such authority, body or person, and there is no provision that an appeal therefrom lies to the court, it means that the legislature did not intend that an appeal may lie to the courts, and that the exercise of the power or discretion given to that authority, body or person is subject only to the supervisory jurisdiction of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The <i>locus classicus</i> on when the supervisory jurisdiction of judicial review is exercised is <i>Council of Civil Service Unions and Ors v. Minister for the Civil Service</i> [1985] AC 374. In that case, Lord Diplock reviewed the common law on judicial review and categorised the instances warranting judicial review as illegality, procedural impropriety and irrationality, with a possible fourth ground as proportionality. The first, illegality, is obvious. The second, procedural impropriety, was the category of cases from which arose the notion that in judicial review the court examines the decision making process and not the decision itself. The third ground, irrationality, established that the notion is not entirely correct. It, however, warrants precise explanation. It does not, of course, refer to the rationality or the absence of it on the part of the decision maker. Although it examines the decision itself, it has nothing to do with the question whether the decision maker, as in an appellate jurisdiction, had erred, and per <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, that error affected the merits of the decision. In the supervisory jurisdiction the court must determine if the authority, body or person given the power or discretion had so erred that the decision cannot be explained and therefore can only be described as irrational. That approach as to the supervisory jurisdiction respects the law passed by the legislature to give the power or discretion to make the decision to the authority, body or person, while reserving the power to ensure that the power or discretion is exercised by that authority, body or person as intended by the legislature and is not abused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> "Proportionality" is a concept not born of the common law but the continental European, and sometimes termed the occidental, system. It is arguably superfluous as there is already "irrationality" for decisions so out of proportion that it can only be described as irrational. The danger is that if treated as a separate category, "proportionality" could erode the boundary of the supervisory jurisdiction and lead to inadvertent interference with powers and discretion specifically assigned by the legislature to a specific authority, body or person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Be that as it may, the decisions of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_71;"><i>R Rama Chandran v. Industrial Court Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 1 MELR 71</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_725;">[1996] 1 MLRA 725</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 145; [1997] 1 CLJ 147; [1997] 1 AMR 433 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2012_1_129;"><i>Ranjit Kaur S Gopal Singh v.

    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In this appeal before this court, the District Land Administrator's order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(7)</LINK> dated 4 December 2008 shows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> There was no appeal to the State Authority within 21 days against that decision. The determination dated 24 August 2010 in the Form in the Third Schedule by the District Land Administrator under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16(1)</LINK> stated as to compensation:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The decision of the State Authority in the appeal to it, was conveyed by the letter dated 14 July 2011 by the Ketua Penolong Pegawai Daerah (Tanah) on behalf of the Pegawai Daerah Kuala Langat. The State Authority increased the compensation to RM2,931,937.50 and dismissed the claim for compensation for "tanah sterile, tanah terasing dan zon penampan."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Compensation under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;;">1990 Act</LINK> is provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Although the decision of the State Authority is final, the appellant has a right to resort to the supervisory jurisdiction of the court to examine the decision of the State Authority as to whether there is illegality, procedural impropriety or irrationality.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We observed that regardless of any error in the basis of the decision of the District Land Registrar, the compensation has been decided upon by the State Authority. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">Section 16 of the 1990 Act</LINK> had, on the face of it, been complied with. Indeed, it was not the appellant's case there was illegality or procedural impropriety. That being so, the only foundation for judicial review that remained was irrationality.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The appellant's submission was that in a land acquisition under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK> in 1997, the compensation awarded was RM5.12 psf, whereas the award by the State Authority in 2010, the subject of the application for judicial review, is RM1.16 psf. It does appear, on the face of it, that there could be something wrong in that decision. But be it in the appellate or the supervisory jurisdiction, it must first be demonstrated that there was an error affecting the merits, and in the supervisory jurisdiction it must be demonstrated that it was no mere error, but the error is so incapable of explanation that it can only be termed irrational.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We observed that the award in 1997 was in respect of a land acquisition, whereas the 2010 award was in respect of compensation determined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">s 16</LINK> in respect of a notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">s 11(1)</LINK>. The appellant in this case did not lose the land as in an acquisition, but only as to the use of the land for agriculture. The comparison with the 1997 award was not apple to apple. The difference alone cannot be the basis of any conclusion. In failing to demonstrate on an apple to apple basis, the appellant failed to demonstrate that the loss of use for agricultural purpose amounted to amount so much higher than the RM1.16 psf such that that difference cannot be explained.</p>

      <b>[25]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_58;"><i>PP v. Tan Tatt Eek &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 685; [2005] 1 CLJ 713; [2005] 2 AMR 353, it was held by the Federal Court that the primary duty of the court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature in the words used by it. It is a well-established canon of interpretation that the intent of the legislature in the words used by it in their natural and ordinary sense. We find in the words of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;11.;;">ss 11</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;16.;;">16</LINK> no reason to import into the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;;">1990 Act</LINK> the basis of determination of compensation in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The foregoing reasons necessarily led this court to dismiss the appeal with costs, which was agreed to be at RM5,000.00 to the 1st and the 2nd respondents, and similarly to the 3rd respondent. We order the deposit to account of costs.</p>
