    <p>By a sale and purchase agreement dated 1 August 1972, the 1st defendant sold a piece of land together with the premises erected thereon to the plaintiff. The plaintiff paid the full purchase price but the land was not transferred to the plaintiff because the 1st defendant alleged that a fire at the 1st defendant's premises had destroyed the title. However in 2006, the plaintiff discovered that the land had been transferred to the 2nd defendant who had charged the land to the 3rd defendant as security for a loan. The plaintiff claimed that the transfer of the land from the 1st defendant to the 2nd defendant and the subsequent execution of the charge over the land in the 3rd defendant's favour were defeasible pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2) of the National Land Code ('NLC')</LINK> and liable to be set aside on grounds of fraud and/or conspiracy. The High Court decided in the plaintiff's favour and held <i>inter alia</i>, that the plaintiff was the beneficial owner of the land, the 1st defendant just a bare trustee for the plaintiff's benefit and the transfer of the land and the charge were defeasible due to fraud or conspiracy against the plaintiff. The 3rd defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant appeal, the plaintiff only pleaded fraud or conspiracy in the statement of claim. The particulars did not reveal that fraud had been raised and the particulars of conspiracy were vague and general. The plaintiff did not provide the particulars in respect of the bank's involvement and how the conspiracy took place. Such vague and general averments of fraud and conspiracy did not assist the plaintiff. The 3rd defendant could not be expected to meet a case upon mere allegations of fraud or conspiracy without any definite particulars being furnished. Generally, the more serious the allegations of fraud, the greater the need for particulars to be given that explain the basis for the allegations. On the instant ground of the plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient particulars alone, the plaintiff's claim against the 3rd defendant ought to be dismissed. (paras 18, 19, 20, 21 &amp; 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The 3rd defendant was the registered chargee of the property and pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(1) of the NLC</LINK>, its interest was indefeasible. For its interest to be set aside, the plaintiff had to establish fraud. The onus was thus upon the plaintiff to establish fraud beyond reasonable doubt. (paras 24-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It appeared that the High Court found the failure of the 3rd defendant to make any enquiry with regard to the plaintiff's occupation of the said property and to take any action to evict the plaintiff sufficient to defeat the 3rd defendant's interest in the property. Such findings were erroneous. The elements of fraud and/or conspiracy must be proved by clear, cogent and convincing evidence. There must be something more than mere failure or an omission on the part of the 3rd defendant. There can never be fraud and/or conspiracy where the intent to deceive does not exist. Fraud for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2) of the NLC</LINK> was amply set out in <i>Asari Mohd Amin v. Zainal Abidin Mohamed Husain</i> and this court would agree with such proposition of law. (paras 27-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Counsel for the plaintiff attempted to allege fraud and/or conspiracy against the 3rd defendant by way of cross-examination of the bank officer. However, a mere suggestion in cross-examination without any foundation being laid by way of pleading was unacceptable. There was also hardly any evidence from which fraud or conspiracy could reasonably be inferred. (paras 31-32)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> For convenience, in this judgment, we will refer to the parties in the manner they were referred to in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This appeal is from the decision of the learned judge of the High Court of Penang given on 21 August 2011. The High Court had granted the following reliefs prayed for by the plaintiff:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We heard the appeal on 14 February 2014. At the conclusion of the submissions, we allowed the appeal and set aside the decision of the learned High Court Judge, but with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We now set out our reasons for the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The facts giving rise to the appeals in a nutshell are that at the material time, the plaintiff, since deceased, occupied a house No 548F, Bandar Gelugor, Daerah Timur Laut, Penang. The land on which the house stood was sold to the 1st defendant. The plaintiff agreed to the 1st defendant's proposal to vacate the house and moved to a temporary housing. The 1st defendant was to compensate the plaintiff with another premises constructed by the 1st defendant, provided that the plaintiff purchased the land. This land is now the subject matter of the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Via a sale and purchase agreement dated 1 August 1972, the 1st defendant sold the said property together with the premises erected thereon to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had duly paid the full purchase price of the said land but the said land was not transferred to the plaintiff because the 1st defendant had alleged that the Issue Document of Title was destroyed by fire which occurred at the 1st defendant's premises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> However, in 2006, the plaintiff discovered that the property was transferred to the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant applied to the 3rd defendant for a loan of RM776,786.00. The 2nd defendant executed a charge of the said land in favour of the 3rd defendant as security for the repayment of said loan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff claimed that the transfer of the said land from the 1st defendant to the 2nd defendant and subsequently the execution of the charge in favour of the 3rd defendant was defeasible pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2) of the National Land Code (NLC)</LINK> and were liable to be set aside on the grounds of fraud and/or conspiracy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The principal findings of the High Court may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The 1st and 2nd defendants did not appeal against the learned judge's decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the 3rd defendant articulated two issues for determination as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Issue (a): No Particulars Of Fraud And Conspiracy Pleaded In The Statement Of Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Learned counsel for the 3rd defendant submitted that no assertions or particulars of any fraud and/or conspiracy were made or furnished in the statement of claim. Therefore, the learned judge was plainly wrong to have found that a fraud and/or conspiracy had been perpetrated on the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In reply, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there were general assertions of fraud and/or conspiracy in paras 10 and 11 of the statement of claim and this fact was acknowledged by the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Now, lawyers dealing with civil litigation have traditionally been admonished to treat the issue of alleging fraud very cautiously and carefully. Lord Selborne LC in <i>John Wallingford v. Mutual Society and the Official Liquidator</i> [1880] 5 App Cas 685 at p 697 stated the general rule. He said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In <i>Davy v. Garrett</i> [1878] 7 Ch D 473, Thesiger LJ at p 489 acknowledged the principle as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In <i>Mallal's Supreme Court Practice</i>, 4th edn, at pp 204-205, it is stated that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It is pertinent to note that it is the function of pleadings, including particulars, to apprise the opposite party of the case to be met. The following judicial statements outlined the function of pleadings and particulars:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In this instant appeal, the plaintiff only pleaded fraud and/or conspiracy in paras 10 and 11 of the statement of claim. The paragraphs read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As can be readily observed, the foregoing particulars did not reveal that the issue of fraud has been raised and the particulars of conspiracy are vague and general.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The plaintiff alleged that the 3rd defendant/bank was aware of her rights and interests over the said property and conspired with the other defendants to deny the plaintiff's rights. However, the plaintiff did not provide the particulars in respect of the bank's involvement and how the conspiracy took place. Such vague and general averments of fraud and/or conspiracy did not assist the plaintiff. The 3rd defendant cannot be expected to meet a case upon mere allegations of fraud and/or conspiracy without any definite particulars being furnished.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is clear that as a general rule, the more serious the allegations of misconduct (fraud and/or conspiracy in the instant appeal), the greater is the need for the particulars to be given which explain the basis for the allegation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In <i>Three Rivers District Council v. Governor and Company of The Bank of England</i> [2003] 2 AC 1, Lord Millet said at paras 184 and 186:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> On this ground alone, the plaintiff's claim against the 3rd defendant should be dismissed. However, assuming we are wrong in holding that paras 10 and 11 of the statement of claim are insufficient to give notice of the alleged fraud and/or conspiracy committed by the 3rd defendant, we shall now proceed to consider the evidence adduced during the trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue (b): Whether Fraud And/Or Conspiracy Proven</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It is not disputed that the 3rd defendant is the registered chargee of the said property. Therefore, the 3rd defendant's interest in the said property is indefecsible. (See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(1) of the National Land Code</LINK>). In order for the 3rd defendant's interest to be set aside, the plaintiff has to establish fraud. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_1;"><i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 1; [2010] 2 CLJ 269).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The onus is on the plaintiff to prove fraud beyond reasonable doubt [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_250;"><i>Saminathan v. Pappa</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 250</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 121, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_444;"><i>Chu Choon Moi v. Ngan Sew Tin</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 444</LINK>; [1986] 1 MLJ 34 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1988_1_66;"><i>Dr M Mahadevan Mahalingam v. S Lourdenadin &amp; Another Case</i> [1988] 1 MLRA 66</LINK>; [1988] 1 CLJ 168]. It is only after the plaintiff has succeeded in discharging her burden of proof then the onus shifts to the 3rd defendant to prove that they are the <i>bona fide</i> chargee for value.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The evidence adduced by the plaintiff can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It would appear that the heart of the learned judge's finding was that the failure on the part of the 3rd defendant to make any enquiry with regard to the plaintiff's occupation of the said property and to take any action to evict the plaintiff were sufficient to defeat the 3rd defendant's interest in the said property. With respect, we are of opinion that the learned judge fell into error in making such a finding. The alleged failures were insufficient to establish fraud and/or conspiracy. The elements of fraud and/or conspiracy must be proved by clear, cogent and convincing evidence. There must be something more than mere failure or an omission on the part of the 3rd defendant. There can never be fraud and/or conspiracy cannot exist, where the intent to deceive does not exist.</p>

      <b>Meaning Of Fraud Within <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">Section 340(2) Of The NLC</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The question was comprehensively dealt with by Asmabi Mohamad JC (as she then was) in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2012_3_305;"><i>Asari Mohd Amin v. Zainal Abidin Mohamed Husain</i> [2012] 3 MLRH 305</LINK>. We deem it appropriate to reproduce relevant passages <i>in extenso</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We agree with the above proposition of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant contended that sufficient evidence has been adduced to prove fraud and/or conspiracy on the part of the 3rd defendant. It was submitted that the learned judge had accepted the evidence when he made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The above submission is with respect, misconceived. It is pertinent to note that learned counsel for the plaintiff attempted to allege fraud and/or conspiracy against the 3rd defendant by way of cross-examination of SD2. We are of the view that a mere suggestion in cross-examination without any foundation being laid by way of pleading is unacceptable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Further, there is hardly any evidence from which fraud and/or conspiracy can reasonably be inferred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> For the foregoing reasons, the finding of the learned judge is clearly wrong in law and the 3rd defendant is entitled to have this finding set aside. Accordingly, we unanimously allowed this appeal and set aside the decision of the High Court. No order as to costs. The deposit was refunded.</p>
