    <p>The appellant by OM 25-16-2011 appealed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;418.;;">s 418 of the National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK> against the decision of the Registrar in refusing his application to enter a Registrar's caveat on several parcels of the land ("the land"). On 8 March 2011, the appellant and the Registrar entered into a consent order wherein the appellant's appeal was allowed and the Registrar agreed to forthwith enter a Registrar's caveat on the land. The Registrar entered the caveat on the land on 10 March 2011 and notified the respondent on the same day of the entry of the Caveat. The respondent was the registered proprietor of the land and on 11 April 2011, the respondent applied to intervene and to set aside the consent order of 8 March 2011. The respondent had bought the land from its previous proprietor (3Q Resources) and had paid RM38m for the land. As the land was charged to a bank, RM30m was paid to redeem the land and the balance RM8m paid to 3Q Resources. The respondent in its application had contended inter alia, that the consent order was entered into without notice to the respondent and had prejudiced its proprietary rights over the land. Further, whatever dispute the appellant had with 3Q Resources had nothing to do with the land or with the respondent. The High Court allowed the respondent's application and the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. On appeal, the appellant argued inter alia, that the High Court Judge was <i>functus officio</i> because the consent order had already been perfected well before the respondent's application to intervene was made. The appellant also contended that the respondent, being a non-party to the consent order, could not be allowed to set aside the order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant appeal, the consent order which the respondent had sought to set aside was made without notice to the respondent. This was a breach of the respondent's right to be heard which rendered the consent order null and void. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> One exception where a final judgment of the High Court may be set aside <i>ex debito justitiae</i> is where the final judgment can be proved to be null and void because it had been obtained in breach of the rules of natural justice. In such circumstances, the person affected by such judgment is entitled <i>ex debito justitiae</i> to have it set aside and the court may exercise its inherent power to strike out the order without the need to file an appeal or a fresh suit. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the respondent had shown that it had come within the said exception. The respondent was entitled <i>ex debito justitiae</i> to have the consent order set aside without the need to file a fresh suit. The High Court was also not <i>functus officio</i>. The High Court had correctly exercised its discretion to allow the respondent's application to intervene and had correctly exercised its inherent power to strike out the consent order. <i>Annie Quah Lay Nah v.

    <p>
      <b>Aziah Ali JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court in Penang dated 29 September 2011 which had allowed the application filed by the respondent, Magnum Consortium Sdn Bhd for leave to intervene in Originating Motion No: 25-16-2011 ("OM 25-16-2011") and to set aside a consent order dated 8 March 2011 ("the consent order") entered into between the appellant, Lee Chai Seng and the Registrar of Titles, Penang ("the Registrar").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In OM 25-16-2011, the appellant is the applicant and the Registrar is the respondent. It is an appeal by the appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;418.;;">s 418 of the National Land Code</LINK> ("NLC") against the decision of the Registrar in refusing his application to enter a Registrar's caveat on five parcels of land known as Lot Nos 35, 44, 45, 48 and 2816, Grant Nos 5655, 5657, 5658, 5659 and 71105 situated at Section 1, Butterworth, Daerah Seberang Perai Utara, Penang ("the lands").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 8 March 2011 the appellant and the Registrar entered into the consent order in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On 10 March 2011 the Registrar entered the Registrar's caveat on the lands.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondent is the registered proprietor of the lands. Despite this fact, the respondent was not made a party in, or was given notice of, the OM 25-16-2011 suit. By a notice dated 10 March 2011, the Registrar notified the respondent about the entry of the Registrar's caveat. This led to the respondent's application made vide encl 10 dated 11 April 2011 to intervene and to set aside the consent order, which the High Court had allowed. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We have heard and considered the submissions made by both parties. By a unanimous decision we dismissed the appeal with costs of RM20,000.00 to be paid to the respondent. We now give our reasons below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The factual matrix that led to the filing of OM 25-16-2011 by the appellant is as follows. The appellant, together with three other individuals, namely, Law Ah Lean, Tan Ban Uu and Khaw Wooi Teong had purchased 80,000 shares in a company known as 3Q Resources (M) Sdn Bhd ("3Q Resources") from two individuals, namely, Khaw Tiew Chai ("KTC") and Chen Mun Heng. After the sale and purchase of shares, the appellant, KTC, Law Ah Lean, Tan Ban Uu and Khaw Wooi Teong became the shareholders and directors of 3Q Resources.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> 3Q Resources then entered into a sale and purchase agreement to buy the lands at the purchase price of RM27,962,829.00. The appellant, Law Ah Lean, Tan Ban Uu and Khaw Wooi Teong made an advance of RM2,946,283.00 to 3Q Resources towards payment of the 10% deposit and other payments related to the transaction. In consideration, 3Q Resources issued 2,946,283 new shares to them proportionate to their respective contributions. The lands were then registered in the name of 3Q Resources. 3Q Resources charged the lands to a bank ("chargee bank").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Disputes then arose between the Directors of 3Q Resources when KTC initiated an action <i>vide</i> Originating Summons No: 24-1537-2005 ("the first action") against the other Directors. By this first action, KTC sought amongst others:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 27 January 2006 the High Court dismissed the first action with costs ("the 2006 Order"). KTC's appeal to the Court of Appeal and for leave to appeal to the Federal Court were dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In 2009 KTC initiated Civil Suit No: 22-467-2009 against the same parties ("the second action") and invoked the summary jurisdiction of the High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ("the RHC")</LINK> to set aside the 2006 Order and obtained reliefs similar to the reliefs that he had prayed for in the first action. On 27 January 2010 the High Court allowed the application ("the 2010 Order").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant together with the other Directors then lodged an appeal against the 2010 Order to the Court of Appeal. During the pendency of the appeal, KTC, acting under the 2010 Order, removed the appellant and the three others as Directors and shareholders of 3Q Resources. KTC appointed new Directors. On behalf of 3Q Resources, KTC sold the lands to the respondent vide a sale and purchase agreement dated 8 March 2010. Eventually the lands were registered in the name of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It is not in dispute that, at the material time, there was an order for sale of the lands by public auction dated 16 April 2007 made by the High Court, Penang. The first auction at a reserve price of RM37.8 million was aborted. For the second auction, the price was reduced to RM33.9 million. The respondent bought the lands from 3Q Resources at the purchase consideration of RM38 million. RM30 million was paid to the chargee bank to redeem the lands and the balance purchase price was paid to the vendor, 3Q Resources.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Reverting to the dispute between KTC and the other Directors of 3Q Resources, on 24 January 2011 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by the appellant and the other Directors and set aside the 2010 Order. The appellant therein was also granted the liberty to apply to restore the <i>status quo ante</i> immediately preceding the 2010 Order. The appellant then applied to the High Court to restore the <i>status quo ante</i>. The appellant also lodged a police report against KTC alleging abuse of the court process and using the court process as an engine of fraud to deprive 3Q Resources of the lands. Pending the disposal of the application to restore the <i>status quo ante</i>, the appellant applied to the Registrar to enter a Registrar's caveat on the lands. This was refused and the appellant initiated OM 25-16-2011 which culminated in the consent order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The respondent's application to intervene and to set aside the consent order is premised on, essentially, the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned judge allowed the respondent's application for the reasons which can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Briefly, the learned counsel for the appellant, Dato' Harpal Singh Grewal, in his submission, raised the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned counsel cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_3_150;"><i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Staghorn Sdn Bhd &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2007] 3 MLRA 150</LINK>; [2008] 2 MLJ 622; [2008] 2 CLJ 121 in support of his submissions that the learned judge is <i>functus officio</i> and had no power to set aside the consent order because the consent order has been drawn and perfected. For the respondent, learned counsel Dato' Cyrus Das, submitted that the principle of <i>functus officio</i> does not apply where the applicant has no knowledge of the proceedings and of the order of court that was obtained. It is submitted that the consent order is null and void as it was obtained in breach of the respondent's right to be heard and the consent order has caused injustice to the respondent. In the circumstances, it is submitted that the respondent has a right to apply to intervene and to set aside the consent order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We have carefully considered the case of <i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Staghorn Sdn Bhd &amp; Other Appeals ("Staghorn")</i> cited by the learned counsel for the appellant. We are of the view that, on the facts, Staghorn is distinguishable from the facts in the present appeal because Staghorn concerns the granting of leave to intervene under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6 of the RHC</LINK> to set aside an order for sale after it had been made and perfected, after the auction sale had been completed and after the certificate of sale had been issued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In that case, Staghorn applied to intervene in the proceedings on the ground that it was, at all times, the purchaser and the beneficial owner, of the subject land. The application to intervene was made about one year and ten months after the date of the issuance of the certificate of sale, about two years after the successful auction and about two years and three months after the order for sale was made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The Federal Court found that the High Court and the Court of Appeal had misdirected themselves to allow Staghorn to intervene. In the judgment delivered by Abdul Hamid Mohamad CJ, His Lordship stated what the law is in relation to the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6 of the RHC</LINK> and dealt with the issues arising from challenges to an order for sale by a person, not already a party to the proceedings leading to the order for sale being made, who intervenes in order to set aside the order for sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In his judgment Abdul Hamid Mohamad CJ, referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_255;"><i>MUI Bank Bhd v. Cheam Kim Yu</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 255</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 642; [1992] 1 CLJ 222. In that case, an order for sale was obtained. After several unsuccessful attempts to auction the land, the land was eventually sold to one Ng Choon Meng. The full purchase price was paid and the certificate of sale was issued. In the meantime, the respondent (the debtor) had approached a buyer (the intervener) for the land and offered to sell the land to him. The offer was accepted by the buyer/intervener. MUI Bank consented to the sale on terms. Subsequently, the intervener applied to court to intervene in the proceedings and the High Court allowed the application. The Supreme Court, in reversing the judgment of the High Court, held <i>inter alia</i> that, the learned judge is <i>functus officio</i> after he had made the order for sale, which is a final order unless appealed against. Once the order for sale is made, drawn up and perfected the learned judge has no power to set aside the order for sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Reverting to Staghorn's case, the Federal Court found that Staghorn had divested its rights and interest and had no beneficial interest in the subject land. The Federal Court held, <i>inter alia</i>, that a would-be intervener who has no proprietary rights in the land is not qualified to intervene. Hence, Staghorn could not be said to have satisfied the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 r 6 of the RHC</LINK> of having an interest to intervene. The Federal Court affirmed the judgment in <i>MUI Bank Bhd v. Cheam Kim Yu (supra)</i> that where an order for sale has been made and perfected, the proceeding has concluded and it is too late to intervene under the said provision. In foreclosure proceedings, a judge is <i>functus officio</i> after he had made the order for sale and when the order had been drawn up and perfected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In the present appeal, it is an undisputed fact that the consent order which the respondent had sought to set aside is an order made without notice to the respondent. Learned counsel for the respondent submits that this is a breach of the respondent's right to be heard which renders the consent order null and void. We agree with the learned counsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909, the Federal Court referred to the Privy Council case of <i>Isaacs v. Robertson</i> [1985] AC 97. In that case, Lord Diplock upheld the existence of a category of orders of the court "... which a person affected by the order is entitled to apply to have set aside <i>ex debito justitiae</i> in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court, without his needing to have recourse to the rules that deal expressly with proceedings to set aside orders for irregularity, and give to the judge a discretion as to the order he will make.". According to Lord Diplock, the type of defects in the final judgment of the court that can be brought into the category that attracts <i>ex debito justitiae</i> the right to have it set aside without going into the appeal procedure "specifically includes orders that have been obtained in breach of rules of natural justice."</p>

Emanuel E Okwuosa &amp; Ors (No 2)</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 414</LINK>; [1996] 4 CLJ 476; [1997] 1 MLJ 453; [1996] 3 AMR 3917, Mahadev Shankar JCA (as he then was) said, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>

      <b>[26]</b> Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) said in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_348;"><i>Annie Quah Lay Nah v. Syed Jafer Properties Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 348</LINK>; [2007] 1 MLJ 225; [2007] 1 CLJ 1, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It is thus settled that, on the authorities of <i>Annie Quah Lay Nah v. Syed Jafer Properties Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i> and on <i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd (supra)</i>, wherein the Federal Court affirmed the rule laid down in the judgment of Lord Diplock in <i>Isaacs v. Robertson</i>, one exception where a final judgment of the High Court may be set aside <i>ex debito justitiae</i> is where the final judgment can be proved to be null and void because it has been obtained in breach of the rules of natural justice. In such circumstances the person affected by such judgment is entitled <i>ex debito justitiae</i> to have it set aside and the court may exercise its inherent power to strike out the order without the need to file an appeal or a fresh suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We find that the respondent herein has shown that it has come within the said exception. The respondent is entitled <i>ex debito justitiae</i> to have the consent order set aside without the need to file a fresh suit. Contrary to the submissions by the learned counsel for the appellant, we find that the High Court is not <i>functus officio</i>. We are of the considered opinion that the High Court has correctly exercised its discretion to allow the respondent's application to intervene and has correctly exercised its inherent power to strike out the consent order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> For the reasons stated above we dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
