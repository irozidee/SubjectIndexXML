    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>Pursuant to a complaint lodged on 12 September 2009 against the respondent's fraudulent conduct as an advocate and solicitor in a property transaction, a Disciplinary Committee ("DC") of the appellant was empanelled to inquire into the complaint, report and make recommendations on the matter. The DC completed its report sometime in 2009 and found that an unacceptable conveyancing practice carried out by the respondent had given rise to a misconduct under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;94.;;">s 94(n) and (o) of the Legal Profession Act 1976 ("LPA")</LINK>. In its report to the Disciplinary Board ("DB") the DC recommended that the respondent be suspended for three years under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;94.;;">s 94(2) of the LPA</LINK>. On 5 February 2010, the DB having considered the DC's report ordered the respondent be suspended from practice for three years. The respondent appealed to the High Court, contending, <i>inter alia</i>, quorum failure and failure by the DC to record all evidence adduced during its inquiry. The High Court allowed the respondent's appeal and set aside the DB's order. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that the High Court should have sent the complaint back to be reheard by a properly constituted DC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Although the alleged misconduct was very serious in nature, it was noted that the complainant lodged her complaint on 12 September 2005; the DC issued its report sometime in 2009; the DB's decision was on 5 February 2010; and the respondent's appeal to the High Court was heard and dismissed on 23 September 2013; before the instant appeal to this court. Thus, a "Sword of Damocles" had been hanging over the respondent's head for about nine years pending the disposal of the appeal. Taking into consideration all those circumstances, the Court of Appeal declined to exercise its discretion to send the matter back to a properly constituted DC to be reheard. (para 14)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Umi Kalthum Abdul Majid JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court dated 23 September 2013 in allowing the respondent's appeal against the decision of the Advocates and Solicitors Disciplinary Board ("DB") dated 5 February 2010, in which the respondent was to be suspended from practice as an Advocate and Solicitor of the High Court of Malaya for a period of three years. The suspension order was to take effect 21 days from the date of the order and was to expire on 26 February 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The brief facts of the case are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The issues before the learned Judicial Commissioner were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner in his analysis found that the decision of the DB appealed against was made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103D.;;">s 103D(1) of the LPA</LINK> upon consideration of the report of the DC on the complaint against the respondent. The DC was appointed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103A.;;">s 103A LPA</LINK> which stipulates under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103A.;;">subsection (2)</LINK> that it "shall" consist of "(a) two advocates and solicitors; and (b) one lay person, appointed from the Disciplinary Committee Panel". The word "shall" denotes that this is a mandatory requirement for a properly constituted DC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It was further found that in the circumstances, the contention of the appellant/intervener that the respondent (Chou Ka Ping) had to produce corroborative evidence of corum failure by reason of the said absence of one of the members of the DC could not be upheld. No notes of proceedings of the DC were tendered to show that all three members were present during the hearing and investigation. It was undisputed that the report of the DC to the DB was signed by all three members. However, on the evidence as it stood, only two members attended the hearing and investigation whereas in law the DC must comprise of three members as stipulated. The DC was thus improperly constituted during its proceedings in breach of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;;">LPA</LINK>, which was not curable by endorsement of the report by all three members. It must be properly constituted at the material time of carrying out its statutory role of investigating into the complaint during the hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It was further held that the role of making findings in relation to facts was solely within the purview of the DC. Hence, the constitution of the DC in accordance with law was vital. Its findings have far-reaching and penal consequences to the advocate and solicitor complained against. As there was corum failure at the stage of the hearing by the DC, it was fatal to the entire proceedings of the DC which were thus rendered a nullity, inclusive of its findings and recommendations to the DB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the issue whether the DC had committed an error of law by not recording evidence and notes of proceedings despite its essential function being to record its findings in relation to facts, it was contended by the respondent, that the findings must necessarily be based on an evaluation of the evidence recorded, without which the DB would not be in a position to discharge its statutory duty of making an order based on the report of the DC. The report of the DC must necessarily mean findings and recommendations together with the evidence recorded that formed the basis of the findings and recommendations. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_189;24.;;">Rule 24 of the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Proceeding) (Investigating Tribunal and Disciplinary Committee) Rules 1994</LINK> imposes a duty on the DC to make a record of all the evidence adduced. Failure by the DC to record evidence and proceedings was thus an error of law in the decision making process by the DC. It rendered the report of the DC to the DB a nullity and thereby, the order of the DB based on the DC's report was on this ground too, accordingly, was nullified and invalidated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The High Court, therefore, and without going into the facts and substance of the DB's decision on its merits, allowed the respondent's appeal with costs of RM15,000.00 and set aside the order of the DB. The award of costs was apportioned at RM12,000.00 jointly and severally against the intervener/Bar Council and the DB, whilst RM3,000.00 was to be borne by the complainant/ respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the appellant had abandoned all issues raised, except one, and that was whether the learned Judicial Commissioner, in quashing the decision of the DB, should have sent back the matter to be reheard before a properly constituted DC. In doing so, learned counsel had conceded the fact that the DC which heard the matter at the first instance had suffered from a coram failure.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On the effect of coram failure, it was submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the complaint ought to be heard before a properly constituted DC following the decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_95;"><i>Gurbachan Singh Bagawan Singh &amp; Anor v. Vellasamy Pennusamy &amp; Ors &amp; Other Applications</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 95</LINK>; [2012] 2 MLJ 149; [2012] 2 CLJ 663; [2012] 2 AMR 403 where the Federal Court had ordered that the leave application be heard by a newly constituted panel. It was held at p 111 of the judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant had urged this court to exercise its discretion and to allow this appeal and to order that the matter be sent back to be reheard before a properly constituted DC. Learned counsel for the DB had also taken the same stand as the appellant and submitted that the complaint should be heard before a new DC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The respondent in reply submitted that there is no provision in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;;">LPA</LINK> that permits a case to be remitted before a different panel for a fresh hearing. Furthermore, the appeal court should be slow in invoking the inherent jurisdiction to send the complaint for a new hearing as the respondent might be subjected to a double jeopardy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant's counsel in reply submitted that there was no double jeopardy involved should the matter be sent back to be reheard as the learned Judicial Commissioner had not decided on the merits of the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We had unanimously dismissed this appeal with no order as to costs and ordered the deposit be refunded to the appellant. We did so for the reason that although the alleged misconduct is very serious in nature, the issue now before us is whether to send the matter back to be heard before a properly constituted DC. We noted that the complainant had lodged her complaint on 12 September 2005; the DC issued its report sometime in 2009 (the DC Report was undated); the DB's decision was on 5 February 2010; this appeal was heard before the High Court and disposed of on 23 September 2013; this appeal before us was heard and disposed of on 1 October 2014. On this issue we must necessarily consider also that even though in the meantime the respondent had continued to practice, the Sword of Damocles had been hovering over her head for about nine years pending the disposal of this appeal, and it eventuated despite the respondent having taken objection to the fact of coram failure, the DC proceeded nevertheless. We refrained from discussing how such conduct may be described or labelled. Taking into account all these considerations, we declined to exercise our discretion to have the matter reheard before another newly constituted DC.</p>
