    <p>This appeal stemmed from the appellant's unsuccessful application in the High Court and Court of Appeal to remove cl 2.2 of a sale and purchase agreement ('SPA') executed with the respondent. The respondent was a company in the Talam Group of Companies ('Talam') which owed the appellant a sum of RM57,425,697.82 for construction works done by the appellant for Talam. The SPA was part of an agreement to settle the debt concerned following a Global Settlement Agreement ('GSA') entered between Talam and the appellant. Under the GSA, the parties agreed that the total debt would be RM56 million instead of RM57,425,697.82 and that the appellant was to accept cash and properties in settlement thereof. Talam agreed to pay RM20 million in cash and transfer three lands, namely, Lots 50603, 50608 and 50609 for the balance RM36 million. The appellant then entered into three sale and purchase agreements for the lots concerned with the respondent and another company in Talam. Lot 50603 was charged in favour of Pengurusan Nasional Bhd ('Danaharta') and Malayan Banking Berhad ('MBB'). When the respondent demanded the appellant to redeem Lot 50603 as per cl 2.2 of the SPA ('cl 2.2'), the appellant claimed no knowledge of the charge. The appellant argued that Lot 50603 should be transferred to the appellant at Talam's cost and expense since the SPA was executed on the belief that it accurately reflected the GSA. Therefore, cl 2.2 was a mistake. The GSA too did not require the appellant to make any payment of money. The questions before the court were: (1) whether the test under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">ss 30</LINK>-<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;32.;;">32 of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> in the rectification of a written agreement was the objective test to ascertain intention of the parties and not the subjective denial of the defendant (2) whether the existence of an antecedent agreement was relevant in determining the true intention of the parties, and (3) whether the appellant delayed in the application for rectification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The courts below erred in finding that cl 2.2 was NOT a mistake on the ground that it was clear and unambiguous and consistent with Recital (B) of the SPA which stated that the project land was charged to Danaharta and MBB at the ratio of 60:40. Recital (B) was a recital that merely set the scene. It was not an operative part of the SPA. To conclude that Recital (B) and cl 2.2 were provisions complementing each other, which put recitals and provisions on par, was a serious misdirection. (para 73)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The courts below ignored and gave no effect to the other provisions of the SPA. It was a serious misdirection to prefer Recital (B) over cls 6.2, 6.12, and 6.16 of the SPA. A clear provision was always to be preferred over a recital. Clause 2.2 which provided for the appellant to redeem Lot 50603 was clearly in conflict with cls 6.2, 6.12, 6.16 and 9 of the SPA which provided that Lot 50603 was free of encumbrances. The latter clauses were equally clear and unambiguous. Therefore, being clear and unambiguous was not a good reason to prefer cl 2.2 over them. Recital (B) was neutral and not repugnant to the said clauses. Recital (B) and the said clauses were equally complementary. (para 74)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Clause 7 of the SPA provided that the vendor agreed to sell and the purchaser agreed to purchase the property on the basis of cl 2.3 of the GSA. Accordingly, the SPA must be read in conjunction with the GSA. Clause 2.3.1 of the GSA clearly provided that the respondent transfer the land free from all encumbrances without any payment whatsoever. (para 74)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The SPA was to effectuate the GSA. The SPA was not a stand-alone agreement. The GSA was the antecedent agreement. But even if the GSA was not the antecedent agreement, it was still the indisputable "outward expression of accord" of the continuing common intention between the parties at the point when the parties executed the SPA. The intention of the parties at that point of time was to effectuate the GSA, which sole purpose was to settle the outstanding debt of RM56 million. The real intention of the parties was to settle the debt. That the debt was to be settled by cash payment and by the transfer of the three properties was the term on the mode of payment for the debt concerned. (para 75)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> If the appellant were to redeem Lot 50603 by payment of RM7 million to Danaharta, the appellant would not be paid the full debt of RM56 million, which would not be in accord with the antecedent agreement or the continuing common intention of the parties when they executed the SPA. Therefore, cl 2.2 could not have expressed the real intention of the parties and was clearly a mistake. (para 75)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Lack of care on the part of the plaintiff was no bar to rectification. The fact that the mistake was only raised after two years had passed from the date of execution of the SPA did not influence the result. When the respondent demanded the redemption of Lot 50603 on 22 August 2007, the appellant almost immediately on 4 September 2007 replied that cl 2.2 was a mistake. On 20 October 2008, the appellant filed a suit to have the SPA rectified. Clearly, therefore, the appellant moved with all due expedition when it became aware of the departure between the SPA and the GSA, such that there was no delay upon which reliance could be placed in connection with any defence of laches. (para 76)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> An objective approach to ascertain the real intention of the parties should be adopted in the rectification of a written agreement. An antecedent agreement was the best evidence of the real intention of the parties. The continuing common intention was the next best evidence of the real intention of the parties. The plaintiff must show that the instrument to be rectified did not truly express the real intention of the parties. Also, that the instrument to be rectified did not truly express the antecedent agreement or continuing common intention up to the point of execution of the formal instrument. There could be no rectification, only construction then, if the plaintiff could not show the real intention of the parties. Evidence of what took place prior to execution of the instrument was admissible and essential to prove the intention. "Some outward expression of accord" was evidence of a "continuing common intention". (para 77)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Evidence of subjective intention was relevant to ascertain the real intention of the parties but the subjective intention and subjective denial must be evaluated under the light of the intercommunication or that which had crossed the line. If it was clearly proved that there was fraud or mutual mistake in the framing of the instrument, and the real intention of the parties in executing the instrument was ascertained, the court might in its discretion rectify the instrument to express that (real) intention without prejudice to the rights acquired by third parties in good faith and for value. (para 77)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> In rectifying an instrument, the court was not confined to an enquiry on the construction of the instrument. The appellant in the present case should succeed on both construction and rectification. (para 78)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The action, to have cl 2.2 of the sale and purchase agreement dated 29 July 2005 rectified, was dismissed. Leave was granted to the appellant/ plaintiff to appeal against the concurrent findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeal on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts, as found by the trial court and the Court of Appeal, could be summarised as follows: The respondent was a company in the Talam Group of Companies ('Talam'). Between April 1997 and September 2004, the appellant, a construction company, undertook construction and related works for Talam who could not pay for the said works to the value of RM57,425,697.82 that was due and payable to the appellant. By a "Global Settlement Agreement" ('GSA') dated 29 July 2005, the appellant agreed to accept, and Talam agreed to pay RM56m, in cash and kind, to the appellant, in full and final settlement of all dues. Pursuant to the GSA, Talam agreed to pay RM20m and to transfer three lands, namely Lots 50603, 50608 and 50609, all in the district of Petaling, with an agreed combined value of RM36m, to the appellant. Concurrently, the appellant entered into three sale and purchase agreements (SPAs) to 'purchase' those three lots from the respondent and Expand Factor Sdn Bhd, another company in Talam, for RM36m. Also, at the same time, the appellant entered into development agreements with the respondent and Expand Factor Sdn Bhd, whereby the appellant was given all rights to develop those lots and to receive all proceeds from the development thereof as the developer in place of the respondent and Expand Factor Sdn Bhd who granted a power of attorney to the appellant for the purpose of the development of the said lots by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the material time of execution of the SPAs, two charges were registered against the respondent's Lot 50603, in favour of Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd (Danaharta) and Malayan Banking Berhad (MBB). One of those charges would prove to be the bone of contention. By letter dated 22 August 2007, the respondent asserted that the appellant had not redeemed Lot 50603 in accordance with cl 2.2 of the SPAs, and demanded that the appellant, under the threat of termination of the pertinent SPA, to pay the redemption sum of RM7m to redeem Lot 50603 from Danaharta. The appellant contended that cl 2.2 of the SPA, which provided for the appellant to redeem Lot 50603, was a mistake which did not embody the parties' intention when they executed the agreements, and that Lot 50603 should be transferred to the appellant at Talam's cost and expense.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At the trial court, the appellant sought, <i>inter alia</i>, to have cl 2.2 rectified, by its removal from the SPA. The issues were (i) whether the said cl 2.2 was a mistake and ought to be rectified by its deletion, (ii) whether the GSA, the SPAs and the Power of Attorney were intended to be read together, and, (iii) whether the appellant was entitled to specific performance of a rectified SPA. After a full trial, the trial court held that cl 2.2 was not a mistake, in view of the oral evidence and the preamble to the SPA, which stated that lot 50603 was charged to Danaharta and MBB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At the Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the trial court had not considered <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">ss 30</LINK>-<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;33.;;">33 of the Specific Relief Act 1950 (Act)</LINK>, that Talam was to pay RM56m in cash and kind, and, that the GSA showed that cl 2.2 was a mistake. The respondent argued to the contrary. Then in a few short paragraphs (see judgment reported in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2014_468;"><i>Menta Construction Sdn Bhd v. Lestari Puchong Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] MLRAU 468</LINK>; [2015] 3 MLJ 689), the Court of Appeal gave the following reasons for dismissal of the intermediate appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the appellant orally submitted that the respondent only demanded redemption of the Danaharta charge; that the respondent would not have redeemed Lot 50603 from MBB if it were true that it was the responsibility of the appellant to redeem from both Danaharta and MBB; that any conflict in the SPA should be resolved in accordance with cl 7 of the GSA; that the courts below took an interpretative approach which was contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">ss 30</LINK>-<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;33.;;">33 of the Act</LINK>; that the court failed to compare the SPA with the GSA or examine the outward acts of the parties; and, that it was no defence that the appellant was careless.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In his written submission, learned counsel for the appellant raised the following arguments. The principal error of the courts below was to take the interpretative approach and to conclude that the meaning of the impugned clause was plain and unambiguous. The rectification power of the court is not to resolve a disputed clause from the standpoint of ambiguity but from the true agreement reached by the parties (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_545;"><i>Oh Hiam &amp; Ors v. Tham Kong</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 545</LINK>; [1980] 2 MLJ 159 was cited). The approach of the courts below defeated the very purpose of the rectification jurisdiction of the court. The courts below failed to apply the two most important criteria, namely, the true intention of the parties, and, the outward acts of the parties, to decide if there was a mistake (Pollock &amp; Mulla on the <i>The Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts</i>, 12th edn vol II at p 2627, <i>Snell's Equity</i>, 32nd edn at paras 16-001 and 16-013, <i>Chartbrook Ltd v. Persimmons Homes Ltd</i> [2009] 4 All ER 677, <i>Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd v. William H Pim Jnr &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1953] 2 All ER 739 at 747, <i>Natarajan Asari v. Pichamuthu Asari</i> [1972] AIR Madras 192, <i>Haji Abdul Rahman Allarakhia &amp; anor v. The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company</i> 16 ILR 561 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_105;"><i>Yuson Bien &amp; Anor v. Bankers Trust Co Ltd</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 105</LINK>; [1980] 1 MLJ 32, were cited). The courts below failed to appreciate that the fundamental difference between <i>Yuson Bien &amp; Anor v. Bankers Trust Co Ltd</i> and the instant case was the antecedent agreement that was binding on the respondent. A court will be prepared to find mistake if there is an independent outside document between the parties that points to the fact that the term in the contract was a mistake (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_4_651;"><i>Southwind Development Sdn Bhd v. Hass Plantation Sdn Bhd</i> [1995] 4 MLRH 651</LINK>; [1996] 5 MLJ 85 was cited). The approach to determine intention is objective and not subjective. Lack of care on the part of the plaintiff or solicitor is no bar to rectification (<i>Weeds v. Blaney</i> [1978] 2 EGLR 84 was cited). Learned counsel for the appellant also pointed to the evidence and pertinent clauses in the GSA, Development Agreement and SPA that allegedly bore out the 'mistake'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Learned counsel for the respondent orally replied that the GSA, which was signed together with the SPAs, was not an antecedent agreement, that cl 2.2 was in the draft SPA, and that there was no evidence that the draft was different from the SPA. In his written submission, learned counsel for the respondent submitted as follows. The first leave question, which was premised on <i>Chartbrook</i>, leaped into the test applicable in the evaluation of evidence without first determining the type of evidence that is admissible. The first leave question must be determined by a two-stage process, namely, (i) a determination of the type of evidence that is admissible, and, (ii) an evaluation of the admissible evidence. There appears to be a divergence of opinion as to the test applicable at the second stage. Lord Hoffmann in <i>Chartbrook</i> suggested the objective approach, whilst the learned authors of <i>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</i> 8th edn, <i>Snell's Equity</i>, 32nd edn and <i>Chitty on Contract</i>, 31st edn as well as some Australian and New Zealand courts disagreed with the wholly objective test. The better approach is the flexible approach, according to the facts and circumstances of each case. The singular inflexible approach is not suitable in the realm of equity. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;30.;;">Section 30</LINK> necessitates the court to find the real intention of the parties. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;31.;;">Section 31</LINK> states that the court must be satisfied that the parties intended to make an equitable and conscientious agreement. A purely objective test which puts a limitation on the approach to be taken by the court conflicts with those provisions. The second and third leave questions are factual and not novel questions of law. <i>Yuson Bien &amp; Anor</i>, which is still the leading authority on the correct test to be applied for the rectification of a mutual mistake, laid down that the court would look into the antecedent and common intention of the parties prior to the execution of the instrument and would not grant rectification if that common intention could not be ascertained (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_3_750;"><i>Chester Chai Chung Ching &amp; Ors. v. Diversey (Far East) Pte Ltd</i> [1991] 3 MLRH 750</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 444; [1991] 4 CLJ Rep 737 was cited). Lord Hoffmann in Chartbrook adopted the requirements for rectification laid down in <i>Swainland Builders v. Freehold Properties Ltd</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 560. In <i>Rose v. Pim</i>, it was held that the important factor to determine whether there was mutual mistake is to consider what the parties wrote to one another and compare that with the executed instrument. Those cited authorities are at one that the one important factor is the evidence prior to execution of the instrument. Based on those cited authorities, the approach of the court should be as follows: (i) there must be convincing evidence of common and continuing intention leading up to the execution of the written instrument, (ii) no rectification can be ordered if the contemporaneous evidence prior to execution of the instrument is vague and inconclusive and it is impossible to ascertain the intention of the parties, (iii) when it is impossible to ascertain the intention of the parties prior to execution of the instrument, then the written agreements shall be the concluded terms of the parties, and (iv) the burden of proof is on the party alleging mutual mistake. There was no contemporaneous evidence. The testimony of PW1 was not contemporaneous evidence. The courts below were right to refuse rectification. The fair copy of the SPA was the only contemporaneous evidence. PW1 admitted that his General Manager had read and informed him that the agreements were safe to be signed. The fair copy of the SPA was consistent with the executed agreement. The GSA, which was signed simultaneously, was not contemporaneous evidence prior to the execution of the SPA. Based on the above cited authorities, the GSA could not be relied as evidence for the purpose of rectification of cl 2.2 of the SPA. The courts below were correct to hold that cl 2.2 was clear and unambiguous. It was highly probable that the appellant could have agreed to pay the redemption sum on account of the considerable potential profits to be gained from the development rights. PW1 was given an advance copy of the agreement. The appellant's General Manager had perused the agreements and confirmed with PW1 that all agreements were in order. PW1 and the appellant's General Manager would have detected the purported mistake. The appellant did not complain about any mistake. It was only two years later that mistake was raised. Mistake was an afterthought. There was no mutual mistake. A unilateral mistake is no ground for rectification (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_787;"><i>Southwind Development Sdn Bhd v. Hass Plantation Sdn Bhd, Foo Lian Sin &amp; Anor v. Ng Chun Lin &amp; Anor</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 787</LINK>; [2004] 4 CLJ 220 and <i>Yuson Bien &amp; Anor v. Bankers Trust Co Ltd</i> were cited).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It is fitting to first quote from two authoritative texts that bear upon the issues and arguments.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Rectification of instruments "is a remedy that has been granted by courts of equity for many centuries" (Spry's, <i>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</i> 9th edn at p 630). Chapter III of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;;">Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> provides that remedy to a party to a contract or other instrument in writing to have the instrument rectified. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">Sections 30</LINK>-<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;32.;;">32 of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In a suit for rectification of an instrument, the court "is not confined to the enquiry what the language of the instruction was intended to be". "The court is not confined to a construction of the instrument, which is also a technique used to correct mistakes in expression without recourse to rectification" (see <i>Construction of Contracts, Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification</i> 2nd edn by Gerard McMeel at p 17.02-17.03, 17.11-17.12). But "before a mistake in a document can be corrected by construction and without resort to rectification (1) there must be a clear mistake and (2) it must be clear what correction must be made to cure the mistake" (<i>Rectification - The Modern Law and Practice Governing Claims for Rectification for Mistakes</i> by David Hodge at p 2-20). "Rectification is different from construction. The ingredients of the causes of action are not the same. The primary purpose of a construction action in relation to an instrument is to ascertain the intention of the maker from the words used by him, whereas the primary purpose of a rectification action is to substitute new words for those actually but mistakenly used by the maker in order to reflect his true intention" (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1990_4_796;"><i>Syed Yacob v. Syed Alwee &amp; Ors</i> [1990] 4 MLRH 796</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 453, per Chan Sek Keong J, as he then was; see also <i>Harper v. Interchange Group Ltd</i> [2007] All ER (D) 169 (Aug) at para 89). Rectification of a contract and construction of a contract are conceptually different (<i>Solarus Projects Pty Ltd v. Vero Insurance Ltd</i> [2013] NSWSC 328) "rectification and construction are two different things" (<i>Damco Nominees Pty Ltd v. Moxham</i> [2012] VSC 79 per Mukhtar AsJ). "Interpretation and rectification should have separate domains" ("<i>Rectifying the Course of Rectification</i>" [2012] 75(3) MLR 412). "... if it is a question of rectification, then the document, as rectified, has a different meaning from that which it appears to have on its face ..." (<i>Marley v. Rawlings &amp; Anor</i> [2014] UKSC 51 per Lord Neuberger P, delivering the judgment of the court).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Rectification is also different in one vital respect. "As a matter of current English Law, the courts are able to consider all the evidence in rectification cases, whilst the exclusionary rules (especially as to prior negotiations and declarations of subjective intent) still constrain the construction process. Indeed that curious and somewhat artificial approach was recently confirmed by the House of Lords in <i>Chartbrook Ltd v. Persimmons Homes Ltd</i> ..." <i>(Construction of Contracts, Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification</i> 2nd edn by Gerard McMeel at p 17.01; see also <i>Prenn v. Simmonds</i> [1971] 1 WLR 1381 per Lord Wilberforce). "The established rule is that in interpreting a contract, it is permissible to look at the factual matrix, but the evidence of negotiations and statements of subjective intention must be disregarded ... But it is inapplicable when the issue is, instead, one of contract formation. It is likewise inapplicable when rectification is claimed: evidence of negotiations and all other surrounding circumstances will be received" (<i>Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v. Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd</i> [2002] 2 NZLR 433 at para 56 per Richardson P, Keith, Blanchard and McGrath JJ). Evidence which is not admissible on the question of construction is admissible on the question of rectification (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1981_1_314;"><i>Yap Phooi Yin &amp; Anor v. Cm Boyd</i> [1981] 1 MLRA 314</LINK>; [1982] 1 MLJ 151, per Raja Azlan Shah Ag LP, as HRH then was).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It should also be noted that there is a world of difference between 'mistake' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;21.;;">s 21 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> and 'mistake' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">s 30 of the Act</LINK>. The mistake under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;21.;;">s 21 of the Contracts Act</LINK> is "mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement", which vitiates the instrument and renders it void. The mistake under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;21.;;">s 21 of the Contracts Act</LINK> is the common mistake of <i>Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston (supra)</i> at p 294. Whereas, the mistake under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">s 30 of the Act</LINK> is "when, through a mutual mistake of the parties, a contract or other instrument in writing does not truly express their intention", and either party, or his representative in interest, may institute a suit to have the instrument rectified.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In <i>Lovell &amp; Christmas Ltd v. Wall</i> [1911] 104 LT 85 at 88, which was the only case cited in Words and Phrases Legally Defined 3rd edn vol 4 at p 33 to explain "rectification of contracts", Cozens-Hardy MR said:</p>

Tham Kong</i> [1966] 1 MLRH 50</LINK>; [1967] 1 MLJ 652, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1987_2_235;"><i>Chee Lui Teen v.

But given that s 30 of the Act requires the court to ascertain the real intention of the parties, the following passage from the judgment of Buckley LJ better reflected the intent of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">s 30 of the Act</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Both passages from the judgments of Cozens-Hardy MR and Buckley LJ were referred in Joscelyne v. Nissen [1970] 1 All ER 1213, where Russell LJ, delivering the judgment of the court, disagreed that rectification may be regarded as a branch of specific performance:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> But more crucially, Russell LJ disagreed with the position held since <i>Mackenzie v. Coulson</i> [1869] LR 8 Eq 368 per Sir William Milbourne James V-C that "it is always necessary for a plaintiff to shew that there was an actual concluded contract antecedent to the instrument which is sought to be rectified". After a critical study of the authorities which held that there must be an antecedent contract before a contractual instrument may be rectified by the court, namely <i>Mackenzie v. Coulson</i>, the judgments of Cozens-Hardy MR and Fletcher Moulton LJ in <i>Lovell &amp; Christmas v. Wall, Faraday v. Tamworth Union</i> [1916] 86 LJ Ch 436, <i>W Higgins Ltd v. Northampton Corporation</i> [1927] 1 Ch 128, <i>Schofield v. WC Clough &amp; Co</i> [1913] 2 KB 103, <i>United States of America v. Motor Trucks Ltd</i> [1924] AC 196, and the authorities which held to the contrary, namely Shipley Urban District Council v. Bradford Corporation [1936] Ch 375, <i>Crane v. Hegeman-Harris Co Inc</i> [1939] 1 All ER 662, <i>Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd v. William H Pim Jnr &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1953] 2 QB 450, <i>Earl v. Hector Whaling Ltd</i> [1961] 1 Lloyd's Rep 459, Russell LJ held that "the law is as expounded by Simonds J in Crane's case":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Russell LJ endorsed the view expressed by Simonds J in <i>Crane v. Hegeman- Harris</i> and rejected the contention that a prior agreement was required and instead favoured a broader approach based on continuing common intention with the qualification that 'some outward expression of accord' is required.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> But the requirement that the continuing common intention must be made manifest by 'some outward expression of accord' was soon questioned by jurists and writers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Leonard Bromley QC suggested that Joscelyne v. Nissen was wrong "in stating that for rectification of an agreement it is necessary to establish not only continuing common intention of the parties down to the execution of the written instrument but also some 'outward expression of the accord' " and submitted that "rectification ... requires the establishment of the subjective intention of the party or of the parties", and that "intercommunication, however necessary in the common law of contract, properly plays no part either in the theory or in the practice of this equitable doctrine, however much it may be anathema to the common law to consider subjective intention in relation to contracts" ("Rectification in Equity" [1971] 87 LQR 532). Leonard Bromley summarised the case against the requirement as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Marcus Smith suggested, in "Rectification of contract for common mistake, <i>Joscelyne v. Nissen</i>, and subjective state of mind" [2007] 123 Law Q Rev 116, that Leonard Bromley's premise was incorrect and "that the equitable doctrine of rectification, so far as it concerns contracts, is concerned only with the objective examination of manifest communications passing between the parties to the contract", which Marcus Smith referred to as the 'objective approach':</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Marcus Smith submitted that the line of authority, to wit, <i>MacKenzie v. Coulson</i>, where it was held by James V-C that it is always necessary for rectification to show an actual concluded contract antecedent to the instrument sought to be rectified, <i>Shipley Urban District Council v.

Hegeman- Haris</i>, where Simonds J followed <i>Shipley Urban District Council</i> and held that "it is not necessary to find a concluded and binding contract between the parties antecedent to the agreement which it is sought to rectify ... the judge held, and I respectfully concur ... that it is sufficient to find a common continuing intention ...

Nissen</i> did not add an additional requirement but rather only qualified Simonds J's statement of the law by asserting the need for 'some outward expression of accord'. Marcus Smith contended that decisions since <i>Joscelyne v.

Transport Industries</i> [1986] 6 NSWLR 740 had reduced the requirement of 'some outward manifestation of accord' from a substantive to an evidential requirement. Marcus Smith advocated the objective approach.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In <i>Chartbrook</i>, the contract provided a price formula for payments. The developer's case was that what was intended was that the owners would be paid either a fixed percentage of the sale revenue for the flats or the minimum guaranteed for the flat, whichever was greater. The owners contended that they were entitled to both, on a strict reading of the contract and the definition clause. The case was argued and decided on the assumption that the requirement was that both parties should be mistaken about whether the document reflected their subjective beliefs as to what the prior consensus was. The claim for rectification was dismissed at trial, because Briggs J accepted the evidence of the owners that they understood the clause to be cumulative and therefore the mistake was not common to both sides. Lord Hoffman, who had the agreement of all members of the appellate committee, accepted the argument that the requirement was merely a mistake as to whether the document accurately reflected the prior consensus, which consensus had to be judged objectively, and on that basis, the owners were also mistaken, because the relevant clause did not reflect the prior consensus as ascertained by the reasonable person. Lord Hoffmann also confirmed the need for "an outward expression of accord". At para 60, Lord Hoffmann said the following, which would prove to be highly contentious:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> According to <i>Construction of Contracts, Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification</i> 2nd edn by Gerard McMeel, which analysed the case, <i>Chartbrook</i> is now authority that the test for judging each party's intentions for the purpose of identifying a "common continuing intention" is objective and that the subjective test which required an investigation into each party's actual state of mind was mistaken (see 17.46), that the objective test prevails (see 17.52), that the outward expression of accord is a requirement (see 17.53), and, that the common intention must be proved to have continued up to and at the time of the execution of the instrument sought to be rectified (see 17.54). "After <i>Chartbrook</i>, it would appear that Lord Hoffmann's analysis is now the authoritative one. All that was required on the facts of <i>Chartbrook</i> was that both sides were mistaken, albeit that they were not labouring under identical mistakes. On the developers' side it was obvious that their representatives wrongly believed that the written contract matched the objectively ascertained prior accord (and their subjective intent) that the two elements of the price were alternatives, not cumulative. Conversely, on the owners' side, it was held sufficient that the written contract did not correspond to the objectively ascertained prior accord. The common mistake has been reduced to the requirement that both parties were mistaken in thinking that the document represented the prior accord (which is judged objectively)" (see 17.61).</p>
    <p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Spry's, <i>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</i> (supra) at p 635 note 6 curtly commented that "Lord Hoffmann treated rectification as depending on legal rules about the construction of contracts, where an objective test is applied ... [whereas] if in a particular case it appeared that both parties intended that a contract should make a particular provision, but it did not do so, on equitable principles rectification would be ordered regardless of whether objective evidence existed to support this contention".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b>
      <i>Chitty on Contracts</i>, 31st edn at p 554 submitted:</p>
    <p>"... the 'objective approach to what the terms of the prior consensus test were' must be treated with caution. Lord Hoffman's dictum appears to look only at the evidence of the prior agreement in a purely objective way, from the view point of the 'reasonable fly on the wall'. The test normally used in English contract law to determine a party (A's) intention is not wholly objective in this sense. First, as submitted earlier, if the parties were in fact in subjective agreement as to the meaning of their words, their subjective intentions should govern. Secondly, if there is no subjective agreement, the question is how the other party (B) understood A's words and whether B's interpretation was reasonable. This should apply to the prior agreement. Thus if B understood words of the prior agreement according to normal meaning of the words and neither knew nor had reason to know that A intended something different, B can indeed take the words at face value. On these facts, if the written agreement differs from the prior agreement (as in the Chartbrook case, where for the purposes of discussing rectification the agreement was assumed to provide from the payment of super overage as intended by Chartbrook), on Lord Hoffman's approach, B is <i>prima facie</i> entitled to rectification. If however, B knew A's prior intention to be different from the normal meaning of the words of the prior agreement, B cannot hold A to that meaning and the written agreement provides what A had intended, B should not be entitled to rectification, even if the result is that B is bound by a contract that he did not intend to make. It is arguable that the same is true if B did not have actual knowledge of A's intention, but B should have known that it was different to the ordinary meaning of the words used in the prior agreement. B does not have a reasonable belief that A intended what he appeared to say. Although the authorities are not conclusive, the result at common law may be either that there is no contract or that there is one on the terms which A intended and B should reasonably have understood to be intended. It would therefore be wrong to rectify the written agreement to bring it into line with the 'purely objective' meaning of the prior agreement. Lord Hoffmann does not discuss either of these scenarios in his speech in Chartbrook and the outcomes suggested do not seem consistent with his general approach. The aim of rectification should be to ensure the written agreement reflects the true bargain between the parties as determined by ordinary principle of contract formation."</p>

These include the important Court of Appeal decision of <i>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v.

    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Local cases have yet to pronounce on 'some outward expression of accord' or the so-called 'objective test' to ascertain the actual or real intention of parties. But given that <i>Crane v. Hegeman-Harris, Rose v. Pim</i>, and/or <i>Joscelyne v. Nissen</i> were accepted in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1966_1_50;"><i>Oh Hiam &amp; Ors v.

Oh Hiam &amp; Ors</i> [1967] 1 MLRA 168</LINK>; [1968] 1 MLJ 44, and <i>Juson Bien</i>, it would follow that a plaintiff must show an antecedent agreement or a continuing common intention with 'some outward expression of accord'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> Forceful views were expressed that the requirement of 'some outward expression of accord' has no basis in equity. For the moment, let it be accepted that the requirement of 'some outward expression of accord' is contrary to equitable principle. But is that reason enough to dispense altogether with the 'outward expression of accord'? Of course, with an antecedent agreement, the 'outward expression of accord' might not be needed at all to prove the continuing common intention. But without an antecedent agreement, the 'outward expression of accord' should naturally assume importance, be it to establish or disprove the continuing common intention. <i>Chitty</i> on <i>Contracts</i>, 30th edn vol I at p 5-114, submitted that "some outward manifestation is required for there to be an agreement". Likewise, some outward manifestation is required for there to be continuing common intention. For that reason, we agree that <i>Joscelyne v. Nissen</i> did not add any additional requirement for the rectification of an instrument but merely qualified Simonds J's statement of law by asserting that the continuing common intention must be made manifest by 'some outward expression of accord'. That qualification of Russell LJ to Simonds J's statement of law did not lay down a substantive requirement. At most, Russell LJ merely pointed out, rightly so, that the continuing common intention must be made manifest by 'some outward expression of accord'. If 'some outward expression of accord' is not evidentially required, how then could it be shown that the instrument does not truly express or accord with the continuing common intention? Without 'some outward expression of accord', how could any alleged mistake between the continuing common intention and the instrument be established? In our considered opinion, the rectification of an instrument should not be wholly dependent on the subjective word of the parties, which, in spite of all said for it, is far less dependable than 'outward expression of accord'. We share the view that "the certainty of transactions would be undermined if the court could act, otherwise than in exceptional circumstances, simply on the assertion of a party to the transaction". As said, where there is an antecedent agreement, the 'outward expression of accord' may not be that important. But where there is no antecedent agreement, there must then be evidence of 'some outward expression of accord' to prove the continuing common intention. Russell LJ merely voiced the self-evident truth that the continuing common intention must be evidenced by 'some outward expression of accord'. As the 'outward expression of accord' goes to proof of continuing common intention, we wholly agree that the 'outward expression of accord' is an evidential factor. Since it is only an evidential factor, we do not think that 'some outward expression of accord' is contrary to both principle and authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Before we hazard to consider whether the continuing common intention is an objective fact or the subjective belief of the parties, we must emphasise that attention must be had for the words of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">ss 30</LINK>-<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;32.;;">32 of the Act</LINK>. Words and phrases in authorities cannot displace the words of the Act. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">s 30 of the Act</LINK>, it is mutual mistake and not common mistake. "The distinction between the epithets 'common' and 'mutual', though surprisingly often confused both in and out of the reports, is clearly stated in the Oxford English Dictionary. 'Common' is there defined as 'possessed or shared alike by both or all the persons or things in question'. 'Mutual' was, indeed, at one period used as a synonym for 'common'; but according to the OED, this is 'now regarded as incorrect' and properly means 'possessed or entertained by each of two persons towards or with regard to the other'. See the more caustic words of Fowler in Modern English Usage under 'mutual' " (<i>Cheshire, Fifoot &amp; Furmston's, Law of Contract (supra)</i> at 294 note 6; that distinction was made in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1967_1_168;"><i>Tham Kong v. Oh Hiam &amp; Ors</i> [1967] 1 MLRA 168</LINK>; [1968] 1 MLJ 44, per Barakbah LP).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Under the Act, the only epithet is 'mutual mistake', where parties misunderstand each other and are at cross-purposes. The Act is silent on unilateral mistake. That is because "traditionally, there can be no rectification for a unilateral mistake" (<i>Snell's Equity</i>, 32nd edn at para 16-018). "To this rule there are at least three possible exceptions or qualifications. The first is in cases of fraud; for 'fraud unravels everything': <i>May v. Platt</i> [1900] 1 Ch 616 at 623 per Farwell J. The second lies in the doctrine of Romilly MR to be found in the much-discussed line of cases beginning with <i>Garrard v. Frankel</i> [1862] 30 Beav 445, in which the court, suspecting dishonesty and yet hesitating to find fraud, has put the defendant to his election of either accepting rectification or else submitting to rescission. These cases have been said to be supportable only as based on fraud (<i>May v. Platt (supra)</i>), and if this is right, they do not form a separate category. The third possible exception or qualification is that which arose in <i>A Roberts &amp; Co Ltd v. Leicestershire County Council</i> [1961] 2 WLR 1000 ... " (Law Q Rev vol 77 at 313-314). "Historically, rectification for unilateral mistake was permitted only in cases where fraud could be established ... more recently, the basis on which rectification will be ordered for unilateral mistake has widened beyond cases of fraud" (<i>Snell's Equity</i> 32nd edn at para 16-019) to unconscionable conduct. "Where only one party makes a mistake in the recording of a contract, the relevant document may be rectified if, in addition, the non-mistaken party was guilty of fraud, or misrepresentation, or the requirements for an estoppel have been met. Rectification will also be ordered if the non-mistaken party knew of the mistake. For these purposes, knowledge refers not only to actual knowledge, but also includes wilfully shutting one's eyes to an obvious mistake, or wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make" (<i>Treitel, The Law of Contract</i> 13th edn at p 8-067). In <i>Thomas Bates &amp; Son Ltd v. Wyndham's (Lingerie) Ltd</i> [1981] 1 All ER 1077, Buckley LJ set out the following requirements for rectification on the ground of unilateral mistake: (1) first, that one party, A, erroneously believed that the document sought to be rectified contained a particular term or provision, or possibly did not contain a term or provision which, mistakenly, it did contain; (2) second, that the other party, B, was aware of the omission or the inclusion and that it was due to a mistake on the part of A; (3) third, that B has omitted to draw the mistake to the notice of A; (4) the mistake must be one calculated to benefit B, which were accepted as authoritative in Littman v. Aspen Oil (Broking) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1579. In <i>Commission for the New Towns v. Cooper (Great Britain) Ltd</i> [1995] Ch 259, the Court of Appeal suggested that knowledge that the claimant was acting under a mistake would extend to certain categories of imputed knowledge and that there might be other examples of sufficiently unconscionable conduct. Given the case law, it is evident that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">s 30</LINK>, which provides for fraud as a ground for rectification of the instrument, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;31.;;">s 31</LINK>, which provides "the court must be satisfied that all the parties thereto intended to make an equitable and conscientious agreement", were expressly designed to accommodate exceptions to the general rule. A unilateral mistake within the exceptions suffices for rectification of the instrument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">s 30 of the Act</LINK>, the court must ascertain "the real intention of the parties in executing the [instrument]". Only if the instrument "does not truly express their intention", may a party institute a suit to have the instrument rectified. The Act does not say that a plaintiff must show a binding antecedent agreement. In every respect, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;30.;;">s 30 of the Act</LINK> is a reflection of the following statement of Simonds J in <i>Crane v.

Abbott Biotechnology Ltd and Another</i> [2004] EWHC 2974, Laddie J put up a powerful argument, which we see it fit to reproduce in extenso, that case law and even Lord Hoffmann's 3rd principle of construction supported the view that the intention of the parties and evidence of it are relevant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In <i>Cameron v. M &amp; W Mack (ESOP) Trustee Ltd</i> [2001] All ER (D) 112 (Nov), J Gaunt QC (sitting as a Deputy Judge of the Chancery Division) cited the following passage from the judgment of Lord Wright in <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Raphael</i> [1935] AC 96, to show that the objective standard of construction which excludes evidence of actual intention does not apply in rectification:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Clearly, therefore, to ascertain the real intention of the parties, the subjective intention and evidence of it is relevant in rectification. To ascertain the real intention, the court adopts, as it must, the objective approach to evaluate all evidence, including evidence of the actual state of mind. But being relevant does not mean that the subjective intention prevails over intercommunication or that which crossed the line.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> To sum up, for rectification of an instrument, the plaintiff must show that the instrument sought to be rectified does not truly express the real intention of the parties. In other words, the plaintiff must show that the instrument sought to be rectified does not truly express the antecedent agreement or continuing common intention up to the point of execution of the formal instrument. Evidence of what took place prior to execution of the instrument is admissible and indeed essential to prove what intention was communicated by one side to the other, and with what common intention and common agreement they made their bargain. "... it is possible to adduce evidence of each of the parties' intention to show that they had a common intention and it is also possible to use both pre- and post-contractual statement from which can be inferred the requisite common intention" (<i>Cheshire &amp; Fifoot Law of Contract</i>, 10th Australian edn at p 12.33). 'some outward expression of accord' is evidence of 'continuing common intention'. Evidence of subjective intention is relevant to ascertain the real intention of the parties. In short, the position in Malaysia is <i>Crane v. Hegeman-Harris</i> and <i>Joscelyne v. Nissen</i>, but with the 'some outward expression of accord' being an evidential factor. If the court finds it clearly proved that there has been fraud or mutual mistake in framing the instrument, and has ascertained the real intention of the parties in executing the instrument, "the court may in its discretion rectify the instrument so as to express that [real] intention, so far as this can be done without prejudice to the rights acquired by third parties in good faith and for value". In rectifying an instrument, the court is not confined to an enquiry on the construction of the instrument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> What would have been the real intention of the parties in the instant case? In paras 7, 8 and 16 of the statement of claim, the appellant pleaded:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b>
      <i>Inter alia</i>, the appellant sought an order to remove cl 2.2 and an order for specific performance of the GSA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> The only witness for the appellant was one Tan Choon Hock (PW1), a director and substantial shareholder of the appellant, who affirmed in his witness statement (121-137AR) as follows. Between 1997 and 2004, the plaintiff executed works for the Talam Group. At the end of 2004, the Talam Group owed a sum of RM57,425,697.82 to the appellant. The appellant and the Talam Group negotiated a settlement, and entered into a settlement agreement, namely the GSA, on 29 February 2005. He executed the GSA and all other agreements at the office of Messrs Yeap &amp; Yong, who were the solicitors for the respondent. Mr Yong Wooi Hon of Messrs Yeap &amp; Yong just said that the GSA reflected the understanding reached between the parties. Prior to the GSA, the parties had pre-contractual discussions and negotiations, where he represented the appellant while Tan Sri Dato' Chan Ah Chye and Puan Sri Datin Thong Nyok Choo represented the Talam Group. The appellant was not represented by solicitors. At those discussions and negotiations, it was agreed that the total debt would be RM56m instead of RM57,425,697.82, and that the appellant would accept cash and properties. It was agreed that RM36m would be paid by the transfer of properties. It was agreed that the properties would be free of encumbrances, and sub-divided into individual lots with individual titles. It was agreed that the Saujana Puchong land [Lots 50608 &amp; 50609] and the Lestari Puchong land [Lot 50603] were each worth RM18m. The GSA reflected what had been agreed and intended by the parties. Clauses 2.1.1, 2.2.1, and 2.3.1 of the GSA reflected that the properties were to be transferred free of encumbrances. According to the GSA, no monies were payable by the appellant for any of the properties including Lot 50603, except for the stamp duty, legal fee for the transfer and outgoings. The GSA provided that the cost and expense of sub-division would be borne by the Talam Group. Clauses 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 of the GSA reflected that. Other documents, including the SPA, development agreement, and power of attorney, were executed to effectuate the GSA. Except for cl 2.2, cls 1.1, 2.1, 3, 6.1, 6.2, 7, and 9 of the SPA reflected the intention of the parties to convey Lot 50603 to the appellant free of encumbrances. Clause 2.2 of the SPA, which provided for the appellant to redeem Lot 50603 from Danaharta and MBB, did not comply with the GSA. The appellant was not told that Lot 50603 was charged. He executed the SPA in the belief that it accurately reflected the GSA. Mr Yong Wooi Hon had assured him that the GSA governed the entire transaction between that parties. He would not have signed the SPA had he known of the effect of cl 2.2. He would not have agreed to pay another RM7m for Lot 50603. Clauses 6, 6.12, and 6.16 of the SPA and cl 2.3 of the GSA reflected that it was represented to the appellant that Lot 50603 was free of encumbrances. The GSA was the main agreement, as all other documents were executed on the basis of the GSA, which was recognised in cl 7 of the SPA. The said RM20m had not been paid as promised. The appellant had no problem with the other two Lots. The first time he realised that there was a problem with cl 2.2 was when he received the demand of the respondent dated 22 August 2007 to redeem the Puchong Lestari land from Danaharta. The MBB charge was discharged on 21 June 2007. The appellant did not redeem the MBB charge. It must have been redeemed by the respondent. Clause 2.2 was a mistake, as the settlement did not require the appellant to make any payment of money.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Under cross-examination (106-113AR), PW1 testified as follows. He was given an advance copy of the SPA. He did not ask for time to read the SPA before he signed it. To save cost, he did not appoint lawyers. He had no option but to contra the outstanding account. He denied that he accepted Lot 50603 because of its development permit, and or that he agreed to pay the redemption sum because of the development potential of Lot 50603. He wanted "the 56 million and not the land". Mistake was not an afterthought. It was the responsibility of the respondent to transfer Lot 50603 free of encumbrances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The respondent's Senior Vice-President for Project and Marketing, Tan Bak Hai (DW1), was the only witness for the respondent, who affirmed in his witness statement (138-143AR) as follows. On 29 July 2005, the parties entered into the GSA "to set-off the amount owing by the [Talam Group] ... At the same time, the parties entered into the SPA". The appellant failed to redeem Lot 50603 in accordance with cl 2.2. The appellant was informed that Lot 50603 was under charge. "The [appellant] asked the [respondent] to waive the requirement for payment of the redemption sum ... the [respondent] did not agree because the land was worth more than RM18m. After a few meetings, the [appellant] agreed to pay the redemption sum." Clause 2.2 was not a mistake, as Recital (B) stated that the land was subject to charge. The amount of debt to be set off was RM18m. The land was worth RM25.8m. "That was why the [appellant] was required to pay the redemption sum because the [appellant] could not be unjustly enriched ..." There was no conflict between the GSA and the SPA. The purpose of the GSA was to fix the settlement sum of RM18m while the purpose of the SPA was to spell out the detailed mechanics of the transfer and set-off. Payment of the redemption sum reflected the value of the land and the GSA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> Under cross-examination (113-120AR), DW1 testified as follows. Apart from the SPA, there were no documents that showed that the appellant had been informed of the land charges. The MBB charge was settled in 2007 by the buyers of the housing units. The SPA was entered into pursuant to the GSA. The GSA did not say that the appellant should discharge the encumbrances. Clauses 6.12, 6.2, and 7 of the SPA and cl 2.3 of the GSA stated that Lot 50603 was free of encumbrances. Clause 9 of the SPA was the respondent's undertaking to deliver the said land free of encumbrances. Lot 50603 was not valued in 2005, but in 2011 at RM25m, based on commercial value. In 2005, the said land was agricultural land. The GSA provided for a global settlement sum of RM56m, but that sum would be reduced to RM49m if the appellant were to redeem the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The appellant claimed that cl 2.2 was a mistake, in that it did not reflect the GSA. The respondent refuted that cl 2.2 was a mistake and or that the GSA was the antecedent agreement. But if the GSA was not the antecedent agreement, then what was it? Could the SPAs and other agreements come into being without the GSA? What would have been the real intention of the parties up to the point of execution of the SPA? But alas, those questions were not asked, or, if asked, were not answered by the courts below who never went beyond the construction of cl 2.2 to the domain of rectification. In fact, the trial court merely read cl 2.2 in isolation and not in the context of the SPA and its other clauses. The trial court cited <i>Yuson Bien &amp; Anor v. Bankers Trust Co Ltd</i> per Ajaib J. At paras 5.12-5.14 of its grounds, the trial court also made the right statements of law on the construction of documents. But even so, the trial court still went about it by a construction of cl 2.2. There was no comparison of cl 2.2 with the real intention of the parties. The trial court merely read cl 2.2, accepted the evidence of DW1 that cl 2.2 was not wrongly inserted, and then held that cl 2.2 prevailed over all clauses of all documents. With respect, the Court of Appeal fared no better, as it also approached the sought rectification by a construction of cl 2.2 and not by an enquiry on the real intention of the parties at the time of execution of the SPA. The following para 15.2 of its grounds typified the approach of the Court of Appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> The core reasoning of the courts below was that cl 2.2 was not a mistake, as it was clear, unambiguous, and consistent with the Recital (B) of the SPA. That, with respect, was construction and not the modus of rectification. But even on construction of cl 2.2, the courts below were wide off the mark. Recital (B) was a recital which merely set the scene. Recital (B) was not an operative part of the SPA. To conclude that Recital (B) and cl 2.2 were provisions "clearly complementary to each other", which put recitals and provisions on par, was a serious misdirection. Another serious misdirection in the construction of cl 2.2 was to prefer Recital (B) over cls 6.2, 6.12, and 6.16 of the SPA, whereas it has long been established that a clear provision is to be preferred over a recital (see <i>Ex Parte Dawes, In re Moon</i> [1886] 17 QBD 275 at 286 per Lord Esher, and cited with approval in <i>Yap Phooi Yin &amp; Anor v. CM Boyd</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> But the most misdirection by the courts below in the construction of cl 2.2 was to ignore and give no effect to the other provisions of the SPA. There was a conflict between cl 2.2 which provided for the appellant to redeem Lot 50603, and cls 6.2, 6.12, 6.16, and 9 which provided that Lot 50603 was "of leasehold tenure and free of all claims, liens, charges, mortgages, equities, restrictions-in-interest and any other encumbrances whatsoever". But all latter clauses were equally clear and unambiguous. Therefore, being clear and unambiguous was no good reason to prefer cl 2.2 over cls 6.2, 6.12, and 6.16. The courts below resorted to Recital (B) to resolve the conflict. But with respect to the courts below, Recital (B) was neutral and it was not repugnant to cls 6.2, 6.2, and 6.16. Recital (B) and cls 6.2, 6.12, and 6.16 were equally "complementary". Recital (B) was not the key to the solution. The key was cl 7 of the SPA which provided that "the vendor hereby agrees to sell and the purchaser agrees to purchase the property on the basis of cl 2.3 of the GSA". Accordingly, the SPA must be read in conjunction with the GSA. Clause 2.3.1 of the GSA clearly provided that the respondent shall "effect the conveyance and transfer" the said land "free from encumbrances whatsoever ... without any payment whatsoever to made by the [appellant]". Reasonably, when construed together, the purport and effect of the GSA and SPA could not be any clearer. The said Lot 50603 to be transferred should be free of all encumbrances. Consequently, we could not support the construction of the courts below. There is another reason why the construction by the courts below could not be supported. If cl 2.2 was not a mistake, then the appellant should only pay 60% and not 100% of the redemption of RM7m.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> Also, we could not support the result of the courts below from the rectification standpoint. It was the finding of the Court of Appeal, which was correct, that the SPA was to effectuate the GSA. Therefore, the SPA was not a stand-alone agreement. It was there to effectuate the GSA. Hence, the GSA was the antecedent agreement. But even if the GSA was not the antecedent agreement, it was still the indisputable "outward expression of accord" of the continuing common intention between the parties at the point when the parties executed the SPA. In either case, be it antecedent agreement or continuing common intention evinced by "outward expression of accord", it would still have been the intention of the parties, at the point in time when they executed the SPA, to effectuate the GSA, which sole purpose was to settle the outstanding debt of RM56m. That was the bottom line of the entire accord between the parties. The real intention of the parties was to settle the debt of RM56m. Even DW1 agreed that that was the real intention of the parties. That the debt was to be settled by a cash payment and by the transfer of three properties was the term on the mode of payment of that RM56m. The mode of payment should settle the debt of RM56m. But if the appellant had to redeem the Danaharta charge by payment of RM7m to Danaharta, that would mean that the appellant would surely not be paid the full debt of RM56m, which would not be in accord with the antecedent agreement or the continuing common intention of the parties when they executed the SPA. Therefore, cl 2.2 could not have expressed the real intention of the parties. Clause 2.2 was clearly a mistake.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> Lack of care on the part of the plaintiff is no bar to rectification (<i>Weeds v. Blaney</i>). As for the argument that mistake was only raised after two years had passed from the date of execution of the SPA, we do not see how that fact could influence the result. On 22 August 2007, the respondent demanded the redemption of Lot 50603. Almost immediately, on 4 September 2007, the appellant replied that cl 2.2 was a mistake. And on 20 October 2008, the appellant filed suit to have the SPA rectified. Clearly, therefore, the appellant had moved with all due expedition when it became aware of the departure between the SPA and the GSA, such that there was no delay upon which reliance could be placed in connection with any defence of laches (see <i>Australasia Performing Right Association Ltd v. Austrama Television Pty Ltd</i> [1972] 2 NSWLR 467).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> We now answer the leave questions in the following terms. When a written agreement is sought to be rectified, the court adopts the objective approach to ascertain the real intention of the parties. An antecedent agreement is the best evidence of the real intention of the parties. The continuing common intention is the next best evidence of the real intention of the parties. For rectification of an instrument, the plaintiff must show that the instrument sought to be rectified does not truly express the real intention of the parties. The plaintiff must show that the instrument sought to be rectified does not truly express the antecedent agreement or continuing common intention up to the point of execution of the formal instrument. There can be no rectification, only construction then, if the plaintiff cannot show the real intention of the parties. Evidence of what took place prior to execution of the instrument is admissible and indeed essential to prove what intention was communicated by one side to the other, and with what common intention and common agreement they made their bargain. "Some outward expression of accord" is evidence of "continuing common intention". Evidence of subjective intention is relevant to ascertain the real intention of the parties. But the subjective intention as well as a subjective denial must be evaluated under the light of the intercommunication or that which had "crossed the line". If the court finds it clearly proved that there has been fraud or mutual mistake in framing the instrument, and has ascertained the real intention of the parties in executing the instrument, "the court may in its discretion rectify the instrument so as to express that [real] intention, so far as this can be done without prejudice to the rights acquired by third parties in good faith and for value".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> In rectifying an instrument, the court is not confined to an enquiry on the construction of the instrument. In the instant case, on both construction and rectification, the appellant should succeed. In the premises of the aforesaid, we unanimously allow this appeal with costs to the appellant. In the corollary, we rectify the pertinent SPA by erasing cl 2.2 from the SPA, set aside the orders of the courts below, and order the respondent to specifically transfer the said land to the appellant free of encumbrances within 30 days of this order.</p>
