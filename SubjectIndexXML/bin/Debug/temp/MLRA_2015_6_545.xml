    <p>The Bar Council wrote to the Disciplinary Board ("DB") complaining that the appellant appeared to have breached the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">Legal Profession (Publicity) Rules 2001 ("2001 Rules")</LINK>. The complaint was based on an interview given by the appellant that appeared in two articles in the Star Newspaper. The Disciplinary Committee ("DC") which conducted an inquiry into the complaint concluded that the appellant had, in his interview with the journalist publicised himself and his firm of solicitors in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;2.;;">rr 2</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">5(1)(b)(vi)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;15.;;">15(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;24.;;">24 of the 2001 Rules</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1978_369;48.;;">r 48 of the Legal Profession (Practice &amp; Etiquette) Rules 1978</LINK> and Ruling 14.01(2) of the Rules and Rulings of the Bar Council 2007. The DC found that the appellant was guilty of misconduct contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;94.;;">s 94(3)(k) and (o) of the Legal Profession Act 1976 ("LPA 1976")</LINK> and recommended a fine of RM5,000 be imposed on the appellant. The DB informed the appellant that it had affirmed the finding of liability and recommendation on punishment by the DC and ordered that a fine of RM5,000 be imposed on the appellant. The appellant appealed to the High Court against the decision of the DB under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103E.;;">s 103E of the LPA 1976</LINK>. The High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. In arguing his appeal, the appellant submitted: (i) the words contained in the first article were the journalist's own words; (ii) the appellant had not publicised himself and his firm; and (iii) the two statements in the second article were not laudatory statements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal and ordering a refund of the penalty paid:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The statements must be read in the context of the articles as a whole. In this instance, the words describing the appellant as a top and high profile lawyer in the first article were the journalist's own remarks; as were the journalist's remarks relating to people finding the appellant's office without any signboard because of the appellant's reputation. The said remarks reflected the journalist's personal opinion. It was something which the appellant could not have prevented the journalist from expressing. There did not appear to be any evidence to show that the appellant solicited the interview or that the appellant wanted to publicise his practice or his firm. In the circumstances, the words in question could not be ascribed to the appellant as being laudatory and in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">r 5 of the 2001 Rules</LINK>. (paras 14-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The two statements in the second article were made with respect to the scope of the journalist's questions. The statements in question were not laudatory remarks within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">r 5</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;15.;;">15 of the 2001 Rules</LINK>. The statements were made in the course of an extensive long interview and in response to questions about the criminal justice system and the appellant's preference insofar as work was concerned. Read in that light, the references to his expertise in election law and extradition law and mutual assistance in criminal matters could to a large extent fall under "approved information" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;2.;;">r 2(m) and 2(g) of the 2001 Rules</LINK>. (paras 16-20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The phrase "in the opinion of the Bar Council" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?PUAS_2001_345;15.;;">r 15 of the 2001 Rules</LINK> should not be construed narrowly. It is primarily for the members of the Bar to decide what amounts to misconduct and this is reflected in the written rules of the legal profession. In this regard, it is for the Bar Council, the DB or DC to interpret the provisions of the rules. The final arbiter on the interpretation of the rules is the court. In interpreting the provisions of the rules, the court will apply the objective test. The court will place itself as far as possible as members of the Bar in order to determine whether there is any breach of the rules. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The fact that the statements are laudatory in itself does not automatically lead to the conclusion that there has been publicity within the meaning of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK>. The statements must be read within the context of the entirety of the articles and surrounding circumstances. The other factors which the DC and DB ought to have considered were: (i) the intention of the appellant with respect to the fact of what the journalist had asked in her scope of questioning him; (ii) the intention of the journalist as to the purpose of the interview; and (iii) the general message that came out from reading the articles. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Looking at the statements in question objectively and in the context of which they were made, there was no publicity within the meaning of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK>. Accordingly the appellant did not breach the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK>. (para 24)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vernon Ong JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal relates to the decision of the High Court given on 10 January 2014 dismissing the appellant's appeal and upholding the decision of the Disciplinary Board (DB) dated 5 October 2012 to impose a penalty of RM5,000.00 on the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 23 September 2010, the Bar Council wrote to the DB complaining that the appellant appears to have breached the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">Legal Profession (Publicity) Rules 2001 (2001 Rules)</LINK>. The complaint is based on an interview given by the appellant which appeared in two articles in The Star newspaper dated 27 September 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The Disciplinary Committee (DC) which conducted an inquiry into the complaint concluded that the appellant had in his interview with the journalist publicised himself and his firm of solicitors in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;2.;;">rr 2</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">5(1)(b)(vi)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;15.;;">15(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;24.;;">24 of the 2001 Rules</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1978_369;48.;;">r 48 of the Legal Profession (Practice and Etiquette) Rules 1978</LINK> and Ruling 14.01(2) of the Rules and Rulings of the Bar Council 2007. The DC found the appellant guilty of misconduct contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;94.;;">s 94(3)(k) and (o) of the Legal Profession Act 1976 (LPA 1976)</LINK> and recommended a fine of RM5,000.00 be imposed on the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> By a letter dated 15 October 2012, the DB informed the appellant that it had affirmed the finding of liability and recommendation on punishment by the DC and ordered that a fine of RM5,000.00 be imposed on the appellant. The appellant appealed to the High Court against the decision of the DB under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103E.;;">s 103E of the LPA 1976</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The first article entitled "<i>Counsel Rests His Case</i>" contained the words "high profile lawyer", "top lawyer" and "people had no difficulty finding the appellant's office (which had no signboard) because of the appellant's reputation". The learned judge found that the words in the first article were that of the journalist and not of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The second article entitled "<i>Keeping Within The Letter Of The Law</i>" contained two statements which were made by the appellant. The two statements which form the subject of the complaint are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In dismissing the appellant's appeal, the learned judge held that the two articles contained laudatory remarks and statements about the appellant and his firm which were beyond the scope of "approved information" allowed by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK>. The learned judge also held that the opinion of the Bar Council under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;15.;;">r 15(1)(b) of the 2001 Rules</LINK> is the primary consideration insofar as it relates to the question as to whether what was said at the interview will reasonably give rise to an inference that the appellant is attempting to publicise his practice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submission Of Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The essence of the appellant's argument may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the first ground, the appellant argued that the words published in the first article were not his statements and as such he could not have been said to have advertised himself and his firm. As such, it was impossible for him to withdraw the first article.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On the second ground, the appellant argued that the word 'publicise' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">r 5 of the 2001 Rules</LINK> means to make known to the public through any form of advertisement. As <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">r 5</LINK> must be read and taken to refer to advertisements made for the purposes of publicity, there must be an advertisement to promote the sale of that which is being advertised. In this instance, the appellant argued that there was no advertisement at all. Merely mentioning that one is a specialist or has expertise in answer to a question by a journalist is not publicity. The appellant also referred to numerous instances to support his argument that no action has been taken by the Bar Council against other advocates and solicitors whose practice and firms are being 'lauded' and praised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On the third ground, the appellant argued that the two statements must be read in the context of the second article as a whole. He submitted that his references to judges who had presided over his previous cases were given in a neutral, totally non-contemptuous way. The interview was to address certain public perceptions that were wrongly held and generally educational to the general public. The testimony of the journalist was wholly disregarded by the DC, DB and the learned judge. In the circumstances, the appellant's intention is relevant with respect to the fact of what the journalist had asked in her scope of questioning him, what was her purpose of the interview and what was the general message that came out from reading the article.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In reply, learned counsel for the Bar Council argued that the references to previous cases and judges are irrelevant. The whole point of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK> is simply that one cannot say that one is good. It is sufficient to show that the appellant described himself as an authority and an expert; the appellant's intention is irrelevant. The two statements are laudatory remarks uttered by the appellant. In making the statements, the appellant had allowed information beyond the scope of 'approved information' as defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;2.;;">r 2 of the 2001 Rules</LINK> to be publicised with regard to his practice and firm. The said rule expressly prohibits an advocate and solicitor when engaged in an interview with the press, radio or television from divulging information other than the 'approved information'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Learned counsel for the Bar Council also argued that courts must exercise caution when entertaining an appeal in which the central question is whether a particular conduct is unprofessional and cases meriting curial interference will be rare. It is primarily for the members of the Bar to decide what amounts to conduct unbecoming of an advocate and solicitor in particular circumstances, according to standards established by members of that honourable profession (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_208;"><i>Gana Muthusamy v. Tetuan Lim Ong &amp; Co</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 208</LINK> at p 209; [1998] 3 MLJ 341; [1998] 4 CLJ 878).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Upon perusing the entirety of the two articles in question, we are inclined to agree with the appellant's argument that the statements must be read in the context of the articles as a whole.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In the first instance, we agree with the learned judge that the words describing the appellant as a top and high profile lawyer in the first article were the journalist's own remarks; as are the journalist's remarks relating to people finding the appellant's office (without any signboard) because of the appellant's reputation. We take the view that the said remarks reflected the journalist's personal opinion. It was something which the appellant could not have prevented the journalist from expressing. At any rate, we are not satisfied that there is any evidence to show that the appellant solicited the interview or that the appellant wanted to publicise his practice or his firm. In the circumstances, the words in question cannot be ascribed to the appellant as being laudatory and in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">r 5 of the 2001 Rules</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We now turn to the two statements in the second article. We agree with the submission of the appellant that the statements in question were made with respect to the scope of the journalist's questions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It is apparent from a perusal of the second article that the appellant's views were solicited on a variety of topics including the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The first statement relating to the AG Chambers always sending their best team against the appellant, was made in response to allegations that the appellant won his cases because of shoddy police investigations or weak prosecution. The appellant submitted that he wanted to impress upon the journalist that he did not win cases simply because his opponent played dead; but that the criminal justice system was at its best- at least in his cases. The appellant also submitted that the cases he was involved in were controversial and of public interest and that the two problems did not exist. The police had investigated well and the best prosecutors were involved in all of his cases to prosecute these cases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The second statement relates to the appellant being an authority in election law and an expert on extradition and mutual assistance cases. According to the appellant, the statement was made in answer to the question on whether the judiciary was corrupted. He came up with an explanation that although it was at one time, it is no longer the case. In particular, the second statement was in response to the journalist's remarks that the appellant takes on cases ranging from murder, corruption, to defending the underworld "kings"; and to the question whether the appellant has a preference. In answer to the question, the appellant alluded to his stint as a prosecutor and to the cases undertaken and the type of work with references to the specialised areas in which he practices including election law and extradition and mutual assistance cases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We have perused the second article and are of the view that the statements in question are not laudatory remarks within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;5.;;">r 5</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;15.;;">15 of the 2001 Rules</LINK>. The statements were made in the course of an extensive long interview and in response to questions about the criminal justice system and the appellant's preference insofar as work was concerned. We agree with the appellant's submission that read in that light, the references to his expertise in election law and extradition law and mutual assistance in criminal matters can to a large extent fall under "approved information" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;2.;;">r 2(m) and 2(g) of the 2001 Rules</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Disciplinary proceedings are <i>quasi</i>-penal in nature. The DB has the power to impose any one or more of the following penalties or punishments:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In this regard, we do not think that the phrase "in the opinion of the Bar Council" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;15.;;">r 15 of the 2001 Rules</LINK> should be construed narrowly. As stated in <i>Gana Muthusamy v. Tetuan Lim Ong &amp; Co (supra)</i> it is primarily for the members of the Bar to decide what amounts to misconduct and this is reflected in the written rules of the legal profession. In this regard, it is for the Bar Council, the DB or DC to interpret the provisions of the rules. The final arbiter on the interpretation of the rules, is the court. In interpreting the provisions of the rules, the court will apply the objective test. The court will place itself as far as possible as members of the Bar in order to determine whether there is any breach of the rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In other words, the fact that the statements are laudatory itself does not automatically led to the conclusion that there has been publicity within the meaning of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK>. The statements must be read within the context of the entirety of the articles and surrounding circumstances. The other factors which the DC and DB ought to have considered are: (i) the intention of the appellant with respect to the fact of what the journalist had asked in her scope of questioning him; (ii) the intention of the journalist as to the purpose of the interview; and (iii) the general message that came out from reading the articles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Accordingly, looking at the statements in question objectively and in the context of which they were made, we are of the view that there was no publicity within the meaning of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK>. Accordingly the appellant did not breach the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2001_345;;">2001 Rules</LINK>. Therefore, the appeal is allowed. We order that the penalty paid by the appellant to be refunded. We make no order as to costs.</p>
