    <p>These were two separate appeals by the appellants against their convictions and death sentences on a joint charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code ('Code')</LINK> for the murder of one Khartic Rajah ('deceased'). The facts showed that the deceased was seen behaving in an aggressive manner pounding on the doors of shop houses before breaking open one of them and surprising the appellants and one other person ('SP10') who were sleeping inside. The appellants claimed that the deceased attacked them and that they retaliated in self-defence. The post mortem report revealed that the deceased died of "generalized blunt trauma". The pathologist ('SP14') stated there were superficial bruises and abrasions, but not deep enough to result in any internal injuries. He explained that the wounds or abrasions did not cause the death but rather the excruciating pain felt, caused by the wounds. SP14 further noted that there was a 60% blockage of the deceased's heart, liver and kidney infection and a reddish colouring of the heart, the cumulative effect of which would have led to his death. That apart, a toxicologist ('SP12') testified that the blood of the deceased contained 0.60 microgram per milliliter of methamphetamine and the same substance was also detected in his urine. The deceased was well above the safe or moderate range. Since methamphetamine was a catalyst substance, the implication was that it might have accelerated the deceased's blood pressure causing irrationality in his behavior. In these appeals, it was submitted on behalf of the appellants that: (i) there was a failure by the learned judge to consider the exceptions to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 Penal Code</LINK>; (ii) the learned judge failed to consider the cause of the deceased's death; and (iii) there was no proper evaluation of the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeals:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The learned judge failed to make a specific finding as to which limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Code</LINK> the appellants were guilty of. The learned judge clearly considered <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300(b) and (c) of the Code</LINK> but failed to make a finding as to which of those provisions the court relied upon in finding the appellants guilty of murder. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was not established by the prosecution as to which of those numerous injuries suffered by the deceased were caused by the appellants, bearing in mind that the deceased earlier fell from the ceiling and was seen much earlier knocking and banging at the doors of neighbouring shop houses in a state of drunkenness. The deceased finally broke the door of the shop house and must have climbed to the ceiling before falling off and surprising the appellants. In that respect, the wounds referred to as scratches and bruises in the post mortem report could very well have been caused by the deceased's own act and by the fall from the ceiling. The learned judge did not address that. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was nothing to suggest that the deceased suffered a heart attack due to the fight with the appellants as found by the learned judge on the evidence of SP14. The evidence of SP14 on the cause of death was inconclusive. His evidence was very general and showed that there could well be more than one cause of death. Also, his evidence was speculative. (paras 18-20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The learned judge's finding that the appellants intended to cause injuries to the deceased that inevitably lead to his death was against the weight of evidence. SP14 verily stated that the deceased suffered superficial wounds on the outside and none was found internally and were not fatal. The superficial wounds were scratches and bruises. That begged the question on whether the appellants caused all those wounds. The learned judge failed to sufficiently consider the issue of the cause of death. Such failure was misdirection and merited appellate intervention. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The factual matrix of the case showed that the appellants ought to be given the benefit of the right of private defence. The evidence showed that the deceased was the aggressor and was intruding into the appellants' room. The evidence also showed that the deceased behaved and acted menacingly upon being confronted and asked by the appellants about his intrusion. The deceased was also much bigger in size compared to the appellants. He was in a state of rage, being high on drugs. There was a reasonable cause of apprehension of danger to the appellants' bodies justifying the appellants to act in the manner that they did. The law did not expect the appellants to be attacked first before they could retaliate. (paras 27-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Both appellants had no recourse to the protection of the public authority. SP10 and the 2nd appellant were desperately looking for an avenue to escape. SP10 had to jump out through the window and in the process broke his left leg. On the use of a plastic chair as a weapon to defend himself, the 1st appellant, in the circumstances, could not be held to have exceeded his right of private defence. As for the 2nd appellant, there was not an iota of evidence to show that he inflicted any injury on the deceased. SP10, being the sole witness to the crime, could not have known what had happened between the appellants and the deceased after he jumped out of the building. The 2nd appellant was only implicated by virtue of being at the scene together with the 1st appellant and they were charged together with the invocation of s 34 of the Code. (paras 31-33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The learned judge not only failed to consider sufficiently the defence put forward by the appellants but also misconstrued the appellants' defence. It was not a bare denial. The evidence of SP10 and the appellants failed to reveal any contradiction. The evidence adduced did not support the learned judge's findings, which were unsustainable. (para 34)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Balia Yusof Wahi JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The High Court Judge at Shah Alam had found the two appellants herein guilty of killing one Khartic a/l Rajah. They were jointly charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> and both were found guilty and sentenced to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Against the said conviction, each of the appellants had filed separate appeals to the Court of Appeal. We heard the two appeals together at the end of which we unanimously allowed their appeals, set aside the conviction and sentence and set them free.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The fact of the case are as follows. In the morning of 3 December 2010 at about 10.15am, one Chu Kong Yun (SP5) saw a shirtless Indian man (the deceased) walking in the neighborhood. SP5 described him to be walking unsteadily, swaying and pounding at the shops. He also described the man to be behaving in an aggressive manner and in a fit of ill tamper. He was unarmed. SP5 asked the deceased what and who was he looking for, and the deceased told him to mind his own business. SP5 carried on washing his car and continued observing the deceased. The deceased was again seen pounding at the doors from one shop to another and finally managed to break the door of one them. The deceased was seen entering the shop and SP5 heard a loud noise from inside which sounded like breaking of a chair. The double story shop was rented by Tock Chee Soon (SP7), in which gambling machines were placed on the ground floor. Three workers namely, Leong Wai Yau (SP10), the first appellant (the appellant in Appeal No: B-05-268-11-2012) and the second appellant (the appellant in Appeal No: B-05-269-11-2012), occupied the upper floor as their living quarters.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> SP10 testified that he and the appellants were still asleep when suddenly a loud knocking on the door was heard. SP10 and the two appellants were under the impression that it could be a police raid and were scared to open the door. Suddenly, the deceased plummeted from the ceiling. The 1st appellant approached the deceased and questioned him. The deceased heaved up from his fall and in an instant attacked the 1st appellant. SP10 said his thought was to run downstairs and get some help. Meanwhile, he saw the 2nd appellant confronting the deceased. SP10 tried to unlatch the door but failed. He ran to one of the windows facing the main street and jumped out. As he was jumping off the window, SP10 saw that the three were in a brawl. There was no other witness to the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The post mortem conducted on the deceased revealed that he had died of 'generalized blunt trauma'. The pathologist (SP14) stated there were superficial bruises and abrasions, but not deep enough to result in any internal injuries. SP14 found a total of 17 wounds, mainly scratches and bruises on the deceased's body. He explained that, in this instance, death was not caused by the wounds or abrasions but rather the excruciating pain felt, caused by the wounds. In addition, SP14 also noted there was a 60% blockage of the deceased heart, liver and kidney infection and reddish colouring of the heart, the cumulative effect of which would have lead to his death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> A toxicologist, SP12 was also called by the prosecution who testified that on analysis, she found the blood of the deceased to contain 0.60 microgram per milliliter of methamphetamine and the same substance was also detected in his urine. SP12 further said that by consuming an amount which is above the range of 0.1 to 0.5, would be toxic, and in the instant case, the deceased was well above the safe/moderate range. Since methamphetamine is a catalyst substance, it may accelerate the blood pressure causing irrationality in behavior by being aggressive, daredevil and over confident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned trial judge found a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellants and called upon them to enter their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 1st appellant who was the 1st accused in the court below, gave evidence that on that fatal morning he was asleep on the upper floor of the shop house together with the 2nd appellant and SP10. They were awakened by a loud noise of someone banging the door. They were under the impression that it could be a police raid. Suddenly, the deceased fell from the ceiling. The 1st appellant approached the deceased and asked him as to the reason of his intrusion. The deceased suddenly got up and attacked the 1st appellant. The deceased beat him about four to five times. He was shocked and fell. In the meantime, he saw his brother (2nd appellant) and SP10 going for the door in order to escape. The deceased then took a white plastic chair and continued to attack him. The 1st appellant further testified that he then grabbed the deceased's waist to prevent a further attack. He did so in self defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The 2nd appellant testified that after SP10 and he failed to open the door, they went back to the room and SP10 took a leap from the window. The 2nd appellant did not follow SP10 as he was scared that he would injure himself. The second appellant saw the deceased attacking his brother with a plastic chair and he went to help. However, he found the deceased had already collapsed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The learned trial judge found that both the appellants had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case saying that the defence is a mere denial; and further found that the defence of private defence does not apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Mr Gooi Soon Seng, learned counsel for the appellants, at the very outset submitted that the learned trial judge had erred in calling for the defence, and he submitted that no <i>prima facie</i> case had been established against the appellants. There was no evidence that the injuries suffered by the deceased were inflicted or caused by the appellants. The learned judge had also failed to sufficiently consider the cause of death. As to the appellants' defence, it was submitted that there was no proper evaluation of the defence and further there was also the failure on the part of the trial judge to consider the exceptions to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have considered the issues raised by the appellants' learned counsel and the submissions in reply by the learned deputy. We found merits in the appellants' counsel's submission on the issue of the learned trial judge's consideration of the appellants' defence and as to the cause of death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> SP14, the pathologist gave a detailed account as to the state of heath of the deceased. He had a 60% blockage of his heart, had liver and kidney infection and reddish coluring of the heart. SP14, in his evidence concluded that the cumulative effect of these ailments together with the bruises suffered would have led to his death. The cause of death was stated to be "generalized blunt trauma". The deceased suffered a total of 17 wounds, scratches and bruises on his body but they are all "superficial wound on the outside and none found internally and not fatal". SP14 explained that certain classes of persons who has a low tolerance to withstand pain, may feel the pain to be so excruciating and may result in death. SP14 further emphasised that death in the instant case was not caused by the wounds or abrasions but by pain felt caused by the wounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned trial judge had at first considered whether the appellants caused the death of the deceased by causing bodily injury which is sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300(c) of the Penal Code</LINK>. However, after having considered the fact that the deceased also suffered other infirmities and died from injuries which would not have killed an ordinary person. The learned trial judge pondered that "the deceased suffered from bodily injuries and evidently both accused intended the bodily injuries, but was it likely to cause death" (see, p 376 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 4). Intending to cause bodily injury to be likely to cause death comes under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300(b) of the Penal Code</LINK>. Having said so, the learned trial judge concluded at p 377 of the same:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that this finding is wholly unsatisfactory. The learned trial judge had failed to make a specific finding as to which limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK> the appellants were guilty of. Clearly, the learned trial judge had considered <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300(b) and (c) of the Penal Code</LINK> but had failed to make a finding as to which of those provisions the court had relied upon in finding the appellants guilty of the offence of murder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> As to causation, it has never been established by the prosecution as to which of those numerous injuries suffered by the deceased were caused by the appellants, bearing in mind that the deceased had earlier fallen from the ceiling and much earlier he was seen knocking and banging at the doors of the neighbouring shophouses in a state of "dalam keadaan mabuk" as stated by SP5. The deceased finally broke the door of the shophouse and must have climbed to the ceiling before falling off and surprising the appellants. In that respect, the wounds refered to as "luka calar and bruises (lebam) in the post mortem report, could very well have been caused by the deceased's own act and by the fall from the ceiling. This has not been addressed by the learned trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned trial judge had also found on the evidence of SP14 that "the deceased suffered from a heart problem in which his blood vessels are clogged. That the deceased had got into a fight with both the appellants and such aggressive state could have triggered a heart attack and thus the death of the deceased had direct nexus with both accused" (see pp 377-378 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 4).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We have scrutinised the evidence of SP14 with a fine toothcomb but we were not able to find anything to suggest that the deceased had suffered a heart attack. When asked by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor to explain his finding on the cause of death, SP14 stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In the light of the above, it appears to us that the evidence of SP14 on the cause of death is inconclusive. His evidence is very general and there could well be more than one cause of death. We may also add that his evidence is speculative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> As to the learned trial judges' finding that "the two together intended to cause injuries to the deceased that inevitably lead to his death", we are of the view that this is against the weight of evidence. SP14 had verily stated that the deceased suffered superficial wounds on the outside and none found internally and not fatal. The superficial wounds are the scratches and bruises. Again this begs the question whether all these wounds were caused by the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We agree with the submissions of learned counsel that the learned trial judge had failed to sufficiently consider the issue of the cause of death. Such failure in our view is a misdirection and merits appellate intervention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We have earlier reproduced the defence of the appellants as it was presented before the trial court. Having heard the defence story, the learned trial judge found:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The defence of the appellants is one of private defence and nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. The law on the right of private defence may be found in various provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK> namely in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;96.;;">ss 96</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;106.;;">106</LINK>. The 1st appellant stated that the deceased had attacked him and he retaliated by hitting the deceased with a plastic chair. The second appellant after failing to find an escape route from the scene, went to help the first appellant who was his brother. But before he could do so, the deceased had already collapsed. In this respect, it is not right to say that the appellants denied attacking the deceased or return a blow as found by the learned trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The right of private defence commences as soon as there is a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body of a person and that right continues for as long as the danger exits. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1980_1_12;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Ngoi Ming Sean</i> [1980] 1 MLRH 12</LINK>; [1982] 1 MLJ 24; [1981] CLJ 251, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1996_2_307;"><i>Ya Daud v.

Dato' Balwant Singh (No 2)</i> [2003] 2 MLRH 665</LINK>; [2003] 3 MLJ 395; [2003] 7 CLJ 285; [2002] 3 AMR 3731).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;99.;;">Section 99 of the Penal Code</LINK> provides a limitation to the right of private defence. If an accused person has time to have recourse to seek the protection of a public authority or inflicts more harm than necessary for the purpose of defending his person, he can not avail himself of the protection provided by the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Having considered the factual matrix of the case, it is our considered view that the appellants ought to be given the benefit of the right of private defence. The evidence shows that the deceased was the aggressor and was intruding into the appellants' room. The evidence also shows that the deceased was behaving and acting menacingly upon being confronted and asked by the appellants about his intrusion. The deceased was also much bigger in size compared to the appellants. He was in a state of rage, being high on drugs.</p>

      <b>[28]</b> The Indian Supreme Court in <i>Darshan Singh v. State Of Punjab</i> [2010] AIR SC 1212, in considering the law on private defence under the Indian Penal Code had enumerated the following principles at pp1223 &amp; 1224 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In our view, there was a reasonable cause of apprehension of danger to the appellants' bodies which justify the appellants to act in the manner they did. The law does not expect the appellants to be attacked first before they could retaliate. (See: <i>Beckford v. R</i> [1987] 3 All ER 425 and <i>Govindan v. State of Kerala</i> [1960] 47 AIR 258). And as Augustine Paul J (as he then was) remarked in <i>PP v. Dato' Balwant Singh (No 2) (supra)</i> an accused person need not wait till he is actually attacked or inflicted with injury in order to react and he is not obliged to run away, for the law does not require a citizen to behave like a coward, citing <i>Mohd Khan v. State of Madhya Pradesh</i> [1972] Cri LJ 661.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b>
      <i>Russel on Crime</i> (11th edn vol 1 p 491) speaks of the scope and foundation of private defence thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Both the appellants' had no recourse to the protection of the public authority. The evidence of SP10 and the second appellant show that both were desparately looking for an avenue to escape and SP10 had to jump out through the window. In the process, SP10 broke his left leg.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> On the use of a plastic chair as a weapon to defend himself, the 1st appellant can never in the circumstances of the case be held to have exceeded his right of private defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> As for the 2nd appellant, there is not an ioata of evidence to show that he had inflicted any injury on the deceased. SP10 being the sole witness to the crime, could not have known what had happened between the two appellants and the deceased after he had jumped out of the building. The 2nd appellant was only implicated by virtue of being at the scene together with the 1st appellant and that they were charged together with the invocation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The learned trial judge had in our view not only failed to consider sufficiently the defence put forward by the appellants but had also misconstrued the appellant's defence. It was not a denial as His Lordship had found and we also found that the defence evidence is not in direct contradiction (as the learned trail judge puts it) with the evidence of SP10. Our perusal of the evidence of SP10 and that of the appellants', fail to reveal any contradiction as found by the learned trial judge. The evidence adducted does not support the learned trial judge's finding. The finding made is unsustainable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We wish to reiterate that the duty of the court is to consider whether the conviction is right and in so doing the correct approach is to consider whether the conviction is a safe one (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_425;"><i>Mohd Johi Said &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 425</LINK>; [2005] 5 MLJ 409; [2005] 1 CLJ 389; [2004] 6 AMR 82. We found the conviction of the appellants to be unsafe. The appeals are allowed and we set aside the conviction and sentence passed by the High Court. The appellants are hereby acquitted and discharged of the offence and they are set free.</p>
