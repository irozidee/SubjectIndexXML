    <p>The appellant had granted banking facilities to the judgment debtor. As part of the securities, monies in six fixed deposit accounts were pledged to the appellant by a Letter of Set-Off dated 14 June 1999. Sometime in 2000, the respondent sued the judgment debtor and 29 others in the Singapore High Court relating to a fraud perpetrated by the judgment debtor and other defendants on the respondent. The respondent, after a full trial, obtained judgment in its favour. The Singapore High Court also found that the monies in the RHB Bank accounts were held by the judgment debtor on trust for the respondent. The Singapore judgment was registered by the respondent on 10 March 2003 in the Kuala Lumpur High Court under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_99;;">Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1958</LINK>. The respondent thereafter filed an <i>ex parte</i> application ("encl 9") naming the appellant as a Garnishee for an order that all monies owed by the appellant to the judgment debtor be garnished and be used for payment of the debt due under the Singapore judgment. The respondent's application was allowed and on 14 January 2004, the <i>ex parte</i> Garnishee Order to Show Cause was served upon the appellant together with the supporting affidavit of the application which contained the Singapore judgment. The appellant was thus fully aware of that judgment. Subsequent to such service, the appellant exercised its right to the set-off and uplifted the fixed deposits to pay off the judgment's debtor's debt due to the appellant. The appellant sold the other charged securities of the judgment debtor and after realising the same, there was a surplus balance of RM67,664.27, which the appellant contended was the only amount subject to garnishment. Enclosure 9 was heard by the Senior Assistant Registrar ("SAR") wherein the SAR found for the respondent resulting in a Garnishee Order Absolute in terms of the application in encl 9. The appellant appealed to the High Court wherein the judge dismissed the appeal and ordered <i>inter alia</i>: (i) the Garnishee Order nisi be made absolute; (ii) the appellant pay the respondent RM350,447.46 being the amount from the fixed deposit accounts set-off; (iii) the appellant pay the respondent RM67,664.27 being the surplus amount after realisation of all the securities; and (iv) the appellant pay costs of RM5,000.00. The appellant appealed against the High Court's decision to the Court of Appeal. The judgment debtor himself had applied to set aside several of the Garnishee Orders To Show Cause which included the order against the appellant. The judgment debtor's application was dismissed by the SAR and on appeal, the High Court had on 20 October 2009, dismissed the appeal as well. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was filed by the judgment debtor but was later withdrawn.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> This court was unable to agree with the respondent's submission that the appellant was bound by the principle of <i>res judicata</i> in view of the decision of the High Court in the judgment debtor's application to set aside the Garnishee Orders. Firstly, in the judgment debtor's application, the appellant had no duty to intervene as the dispute there was between the respondent and the judgment debtor and was premised on the Singapore judgment which the appellant was not a party to. Secondly, the cause of action between the appellant and the respondent was different. The issue between the appellant and respondent was premised on the Letter of Set-Off and did not concern whether the judgment debtor held the garnished accounts on trust for the respondent. Hence, the principle of <i>res judicata</i> did not apply. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The question which this court was confronted with was whether the appellant should be bound by the Singapore judgment in that since the monies in the deposit accounts were tainted with illegality, the appellant's letter of pledge was also tainted. This ought to be answered in the negative for the following reasons. Firstly, the appellant was not a party to that suit. Secondly, there was no evidence whatsoever that the appellant was aware that the monies in the six deposit accounts were from bribes and obtained fraudulently by judgment debtor. That being the case, the appellant could be said that they were in a position of a "<i>bona fide</i> recipient for value and without notice" and its rights to the monies in the six deposit accounts could not be affected by the judgment debtor's illegal conduct. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the High Court judge had placed undue importance on the Singapore judgment which had no relevance to what was before this court, which was whether the six deposit accounts were subject to garnishment by the respondent. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> To determine the nature of the relationship between the judgment debtor and the appellant, this court had to construe the two documents before it, namely the Letter of Offer and Letter of Set-Off. In construing any commercial contract, courts must construe them in the context of the commercial purpose and surrounding circumstances in which the same came into existence. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant case, it was in the context of a banking facility granted by a bank to its customer and as security that the judgment debtor was required to pledge his six deposit accounts with the appellant. The intention was quite clear that the judgment debtor could not uplift the six deposit accounts before the full repayment of the banking facility unless the appellant consented to the uplifting. What that meant was that the judgment debtor had no right whatsoever to the monies in the six deposit accounts until the secured amount had been fully paid. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The judgment debtor's interests in the six deposit accounts were conditional upon the full repayment of the banking facility, which it was not disputed was still owing at the material time. He thus had no claim on the monies in the six deposit accounts and when the respondent stepped in the shoes of the judgment debtor, it too had no claim on those monies. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The crucial question which one asks in a garnishee proceeding is simply whether the debt due to the judgment debtor by the garnishee is actionable at the time of application for a garnishee order. In the instant case, the judgment debtor could not claim ownership or demand for the return of the six deposit accounts from the appellant in view of his pledge of the same for the banking facilities.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>David Wong Dak Wah JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge in which she affirmed the decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar, who had on the application of the respondent, made various garnishee orders absolute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard the appeal and reserved judgment. We now give our decision and grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant had granted banking facilities to the judgment debtor and as part of securities, monies in six fixed deposit accounts (six deposit accounts) were pledged with the appellant. The pledge was in a form of a Letter of Set- Off dated 14 June 1999.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Sometime in 2000, the respondent sued the judgment debtor and 29 others in the Singapore High Court relating to a massive fraud perpetrated by the judgment debtor and other defendants on the respondent. The respondent, after a full trial on 30 August 2002, obtained judgment in the sum of US$79 million against the judgment debtor (Singapore Judgment). The Singapore High Court found as a matter of fact that the judgment debtor was instrumental in the fraud and had accepted bribes of at least US$1.2 million from third parties. Those bribes had been mainly deposited in the judgment debtor's accounts in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The Singapore High Court had also found that the monies in the RHB Bank accounts were held by the judgment debtor on trust for the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> There is no dispute by the appellant that the Singapore judgment referred to and encompassed the six fixed deposit accounts garnished in the appellant and as at 11 March 2004, the monies in the same were in the sum of RM350,447.46.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Singapore judgment was registered by the respondent on 10 March 2003 in the Kuala Lumpur High Court under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_99;;">Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act 1958</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 12 November 2003, the respondent filed an <i>ex parte</i> application (encl 9) naming the appellant as a garnishee for an order that all monies owed by the appellant to the judgment debtor be garnished and be used for payment of the debt due under the Singapore judgment. The aforesaid application was granted in terms on 14 January 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 14 January 2004 <i>ex parte</i> garnishee order to show cause was served on the appellant together with the supporting affidavit of that application which contained the Singapore judgment. Hence, the appellant was fully aware of that judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 10 March 2004, presumably in view of the service of encl 9 on it, the appellant in exercise of what it assert to be its right of set-off proceeded to uplift six deposit accounts and utilise the same to pay off the judgment debtor's debt due to the appellant. The appellant had also sold the other charged securities of the judgment debtor and after realising the same, there was a surplus balance of RM67,664.27 which the appellant contends that this is the only amount subject to garnishment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Enclosure 9 was finally heard by the Senior Assistant Registrar on 8 October 2013 wherein she found in favor of the respondent, resulting in a Garnishee Order Absolute in terms of the application in encl 9.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant then appealed to the High Court wherein the learned judge on 22 October 2013 dismissed the same and the following orders were made:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is those orders which are the subject of this appeal. It is to be noted that the orders made by the learned judge had been fully complied with by the appellant without prejudice to this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We also note that the judgment debtor himself had applied to set aside five of the nine garnishee orders to show cause which included the order against the appellant. The judgment debtor's application was dismissed by Senior Assistant Registrar (15 November 2005) and on appeal, Lau Bee Lan J had on 20 October 2009, dismissed the same as well. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was launched by the judgment debtor but was later withdrawn on 15 February 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> From the grounds of the learned judge, there is little doubt that she felt that the Singapore judgment had to be complied with. This can be seen from para iv of her grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Grounds Of Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> From the submission of learned counsel for the respondent, he makes two points, namely, the failure on the part of the appellant in intervening the judgment debtor's application to set aside the garnishee order to show cause and the effect of the Singapore judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In respect of aforesaid failure, learned counsel relies on the judgment of Lau Bee Lan J where Her Ladyship on the same facts and issues found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Premised on that ruling, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the appellant is bound by the principle of <i>res judicata</i> and refers the court to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_611;"><i>Asia Commercial Finance (M) Bhd v. Kawal Teliti Sdn Bhd</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 611</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 189; [1995] 3 CLJ 783; [1995] 3 AMR 2559, where the Supreme Court held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> With respect, we are unable to agree with submission of learned counsel and our reasons are these. Firstly, the appellant had no duty to intervene in the application before Her Ladyship as the dispute before her was between the respondent and the judgment debtor and was premised on the Singapore Judgment which the appellant was not a party. Secondly, the issue or cause of action between the appellant and the respondent is different to that before Her Ladyship. The issue between the appellant and respondent is premised on the Letter of Set-Off and did not concern as to whether the judgment debtor held the garnished accounts on trust for the respondent. Hence, we find that the principle of <i>res judicata</i> does not apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> There is no doubt that the decisions of the Senior Assistant Registrar, Her Ladyship Lau Bee Lan and the learned judge in this appeal are all premised on what was found by the Singapore High Court that the judgment debtor holds the garnished monies on trust on behalf of the respondent. Those monies were from fraudulent conducts and bribes accepted by the judgment debtor. In other words, they were tainted with illegality.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The question which confronts us is whether the appellant should be bound by the Singapore judgment in that as the monies in the six deposit accounts are tainted with illegality, the appellant's letter of pledge is also tainted. We answer this in the negative and our reasons are these. Firstly, the appellant as mentioned earlier was not a party to that suit. Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever that the appellant was aware that the monies in the six deposit accounts were from bribes and obtained fraudulently by judgment debtor. That being the case, the appellant can be said that they are in a position of a "<i>bona fide</i> recipient for value and without notice" and its rights to the monies in the six deposit accounts cannot be affected by the judgment debtor's illegal conducts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Further, we are not aware of any legislation or case law which requires banks like the appellant here to ascertain as to the source of the monies which their customers bring in. In fact the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_481;"><i>Chang Yun Tai &amp; Ors v. HSBC Bank (M) Berhad &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 481</LINK>; [2011] 7 MLJ 909; [2011] 7 CLJ 909 at p 486-487 held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In the aforesaid case, it concerned the illegality of the sale and purchase agreements entered by the appellants there and the developer and was premised on the contention that the respondent/bank had a duty to ensure those agreements were proper and valid. The Federal Court held that there was no such duty when the respondent/bank was not a party to those agreements even though financial facility were granted premised on those agreements. Similarly here, the appellant cannot be imposed of such duty to enquire or investigate as to the source of the monies of the judgment debtor. To impose such duty, the whole banking facility would grind to a standstill and hence commercial activities as well.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> For reasons stated above, we are of the considered opinion that the learned judge had placed undue importance to the Singapore judgment which has no relevance to what we have before us and that is whether the six deposit accounts are subject to garnishment by the respondent which we now will deliberate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The starting point of our deliberation must be the Letter of Set-Off dated 14 June 1999 issued by the judgment debtor to the appellant. The two material clauses therein, referred to us by learned counsel for appellant were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> This Letter of Set-Off was in relation to the acceptance of the appellant's letter of offer (10 June 1999) in respect of overdraft facilities of RM300,000.00. It is also pertinent to note that the appellant had extended a housing loan facility to the judgment debtor pursuant to an earlier letter of offer dated 23 December 1999.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The parties had also on 29 February 2000 entered into a facilities agreement and the following parts of the default clause therein was also highlighted to us.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The appellant also referred to us the notice issued to the judgment debtor dated 16 February 2004 which demanded settlement of the outstanding sums under the housing and overdraft facilities and which further stated that in the event of default of such settlement the fixed deposit would be uplifted. This was in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Premised on those paragraphs, learned counsel for the appellant submits that the judgment debtor had assigned his interest in the six deposit accounts to the appellant and upon default of the demand to pay, the appellant was entitled to uplift the fixed deposits. Hence the respondent had nothing to garnish. Learned counsel relies on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1990_2_279;"><i>Tan Way Boon &amp; Ors v. Omar Marican Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1990] 2 MLRH 279</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 122; [1990] 3 CLJ 202 where it was held that a garnishee cannot attach a debt which had been equitably assigned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We have no issue with that proposition of law. It is simply based on the principle that the judgment debtor cannot give what he has not got. In other words, the respondent as a judgment creditor steps into the shoes of the judgment debtor as they cannot have a better claim than that of the judgment debtor against the appellant (see <i>Official Assignee Of Madras v. Mercantile Bank Of India Ltd</i> [1935] AC 53).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> To determine the nature of the relationship between the judgment debtor and the appellant, we must construe the two documents before us namely the Letter of Offer and Letter of Set-Off. In construing any commercial contract, Courts must construe them in the context of the commercial purpose and surrounding circumstances in which the same came into existence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In our present case, it is in the context of a banking facility granted by a bank to its customer and as security the judgment debtor was required to pledge his six deposit accounts with the appellant. In our view, the intention is quite clear and that is, the judgment debtor cannot uplift the six deposit accounts before the full repayment of the banking facility unless the appellant consents to the uplifting. What that simply means is that the judgment debtor has no right whatsoever to the monies in the six deposit accounts until the secured amount has been fully paid. What we just stated is clear from cl 7 of the Letter of Set-Off which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In short, the judgment debtor's interests in the six deposit accounts are conditional upon the full repayment of the banking facility, which it is not disputed was still owing at the material time. He thus had no claim on the monies in the six deposit accounts and when the respondent steps in the shoes of the judgment debtor, it too had no claim on those monies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Learned counsel for respondent in his oral submission had relied heavily on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1987_1_504;"><i>Kedah Kelang Papan Sdn Bhd v. Hansol Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1987] 1 MLRH 504</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 434; [1988] 1 CLJ 645 and urged us to follow it. The issue which arose in that case was that whether retention money in a construction contract can be garnished. Retention money is money being retained by the developer/garnishee during the works defect period to compensate the garnishee for defect works done by the contractor/judgment debtor. Such retention money is common in the building industry. Lim Beng Choon J found that the retention sum can be garnished despite the non-expiry of the works defect period as in his view those monies had been earned by the judgment debtor for works already done. It is in His Lordship's view a "debitum in prasesenti" not yet actually payable but nevertheless a debt due which is represented by an existing obligation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> A contrary decision can be found in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_2_504;"><i>Binamin MJC Quarry Sdn Bhd v. Way Soon Construction Sdn Bhd; TRS Bina Sdn Bhd (Garnishee); Hong Leong Finance Bhd (Intervener)</i> [2001] 2 MLRH 504</LINK>; [2001] 6 CLJ 213 where the High Court was confronted with the same question of whether retention sum in a construction contract is subject to garnishee proceeding when the defect liability period had not expired. Abdul Aziz Mohamad J (as he then was) was confronted with the rationale propounded in the Kedah Kelang Papan and after reviewing other relevant cases concluded that what was held in Kedah Kelang Papan was incorrect. This is what His Lordship said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> With respect to His Lordship in Kedah Kelang Papan, we prefer the reasoning in Binamin MJC Quarry. The crucial question, which one asks in a garnishee proceeding is simply whether the debt due to the judgment debtor by the garnishee is actionable at the time of application for a garnishee order. It is our view that the learned judge in Kedah Kelang Papan paid undue emphasis on the fact that the judgment debtor had earned its retention money without asking the question whether the judgment debtor did have immediate access to that money. The answer is simply no as the ownership of the retention money is subject to a "clean bill of health" in respect of defects in the construction. Similarly here, the judgment debtor cannot claim ownership or demand for the return of the six deposit accounts from the appellant in view of his pledge of the same for the banking facility.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
