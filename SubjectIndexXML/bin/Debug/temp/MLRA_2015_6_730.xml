    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his conviction and sentence for trafficking in dangerous drugs. At the end of the prosecution's case in the High Court, the counsel for the appellant raised two issues which were, the discrepancy in the weight of the drugs seized, and that there was a break in the chain of evidence. The trial judge found, amongst others, that the pair of sandals worn by the appellant ('the sandals') in which the drugs were found, which had been identified by prosecution witnesses and the different terminologies used by the witnesses to describe the sandals did not affect their credibility; the weight of the drugs stated in the charge was in accordance with the weight as certified by the chemist, PW6, in his report; the irrespirable inference was that the appellant had knowledge of what was in the sandals; and the concealment of the drugs in the sandals together with the fact that the appellant had travelled and transported the drugs to Malaysia amounted to 'trafficking' as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('s 2')</LINK>. At the end of the defence case, the trial judge found that the appellant's defence was not probable, reasonable or logical to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and accordingly, the appellant was convicted and sentenced accordingly. The main issues to be determined in this appeal were, whether there was any discrepancy in the weight of the drugs; whether there was a break in the chain of evidence; and whether the trial judge erred in applying s 2 and finding that the prosecution had established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal and affirming the conviction and sentence imposed):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was trite that the failure to cross-examine a witness on a crucial part of the case would amount to an acceptance of that testimony. Therefore, the burden was on the defence to cross-examine the relevant witnesses on the issue of the weight of the drugs. Here, in the absence of any challenge by way of cross-examination of PW6 regarding the weight of the drugs, the issue of discrepancies in the weight was devoid of any merit. There was no evidence to support the suggestion that the drug exhibits could have been tampered with. (paras 34 &amp; 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, there was no evidence to suggest a break in the handling or custody of the exhibits which was tantamount to a break in the chain of evidence. There was no doubt that the drug exhibits seized from the appellant and as examined by PW6 were the same drug exhibits that the appellant was charged with. Hence, the contention that there was a break in the chain of evidence and that the drug exhibits produced before the High Court might not be the same as the one seized from the appellant was misconceived. (para 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Based on the manner the drugs were being carried, ie carefully concealed in the soles of the sandals to avoid detection and, taking into account the total amount of the drugs involved, the trial judge was correct to apply s 2, that the appellant was in fact carrying or conveying the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Accordingly, the trial judge had not erred in her findings that the prosecution had established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. (paras 41-42)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>Aziah Ali JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged for trafficking in dangerous drugs. The charge reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 15 June 2010, Customs Officer Abdul Halim Sahari (PW3) was on duty at Counter 'D' at the International Arrival Hall, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). He saw the appellant heading towards the Green Lane carrying a black bagpack (beg sandang).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> PW3 called the appellant and asked him to have his bag scanned. Nothing suspicious was seen. PW3 then asked the appellant to remove the sandals (exh P5A &amp; 5B) that he was wearing and have the sandals scanned because PW3 saw that the sandals were thicker than normal. The scan showed a green image which indicated the presence of drugs. PW3 inspected the sandals and testified amongst others as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> PW3 handed over the appellant, the sandals and the black bag to Meor Ahmad Sazali Dol Hadi (PW4). According to PW4, PW3 told him that the scanning of the sandals showed suspicious images. PW3 then left to continue with his duty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> PW4 arrested the appellant and contacted three other members of his team. PW4 did not inspect the bag and the sandals at KLIA. PW4 together with the members of his team brought the appellant and the exhibits to the Customs Office at Kampung Jijan, Nilai. There the Investigating Officer (IO) Wee Sew Hin (PW5) asked PW4 to conduct a thorough search.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> PW4 asked the appellant to sit opposite him while he inspected the sandals. Also present was photographer Mohammad Shuib Fauzi (PW2) and another officer by the name of 'Kavisutha' who recorded the items seized and prepared the list exh P41. Kavisutha later handed over the list to PW5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> PW4 testified amongst others as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> According to PW4, the plastic packets were not visible unless the sandals were cut open. He could not pull out the plastic packets from the sandals for fear that the packets would tear and the contents would spill out. PW4 marked the bulging part of the sandals as 'A' (the right sandal) and 'B' (the left sandal) in blue and the plastic packets containing the drugs inside the soles as 'A1' and 'B1' (see pp 296-297 Appeal Record). He also put down his signature and date. PW4 then handed over the appellant together with the exhibits seized to PW5 (exh P36) and also lodged a police report (exh D39).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Likewise, PW5 marked the right sandal as 'A' and the plastic packet as 'A1', signed and put the date. He marked the left sandal as 'B' and the plastic packet as 'B1', signed and also put the date. PW5 testified that he questioned the appellant but the appellant was unable to converse in English or Malay. So PW5 arranged for an interpreter who came and interpreted the list exh P41 to the appellant. PW5 kept the sandals inside a steel cabinet in his room.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> PW2 the photographer confirmed in his testimony that on 15 June 2010 at about 12 noon, he was instructed by PW5 to take the photographs. He saw PW4 opening up the sandals and marking the exhibits. After PW4 had marked the sandals, PW5 also marked them. PW2 took photographs of the exhs P11 (1-17). The following day he took photographs of exhs P12(1) &amp; 12(2) &amp; P13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 16 June 2010, PW5 took the sandals packed in a box which he marked as 'A' (exh P5) and the form 'Kimia 14' (exh D43) to the chemist, Zulkefli Mohd Edin (PW6) who acknowledged receipt (exh P40).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In exh D43, PW5 stated that the pair of sandals marked 'A' and 'B' were suspected to contain 'syabu', a dangerous drug and the gross weight of the sandal marked 'A' was 427 grams and the gross weight of the sandal marked 'B' was 363 grams. The total gross weight of both 'A' &amp; 'B' was stated as 790 grams (p 337 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> PW6 confirmed receipt of the box which contained a pair of sandals marked 'A' and 'B' inside which were transparent plastic packets of crystalline substance marked as 'A1' and 'B1' respectively. The plastic packet was secured to each sandal with adhesive tape. According to PW6, the plastic packets were difficult to remove.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> PW6 weighed each plastic packet. He found the packet marked 'A1' weighed 221.2 grams and the packet marked 'B1' weighed 184.7 grams. PW6 analysed the crystalline substance in each packet and found the crystalline substance contained methamphetamine. Packet 'A1' contained 169.8 grams of methamphetamine and packet 'B1' contained 142.4 grams of the same drug. PW6 prepared a chemist report (exh P42). On 21 September 2010, PW6 handed over the exhibits and the chemist report to PW5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The boarding passes (exhs P18 &amp; P19) recovered from the appellant showed that he had travelled from Damascus to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. The passenger electronic ticket (exh P38) was in the appellant's name.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of Trial Judge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case, the learned defence counsel raised two issues:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The trial judge found that the pair of sandals had been identified by PW3, PW4, PW5 and PW6 and the different terminologies used by the witnesses to describe the sandals did not affect their credibility. PW3 had handed over the appellant, the sandals and the bag to PW4 who had inspected the sandals at the customs office. The weight of the drugs stated in the charge is in accordance with the weight as certified by PW6 in his report. The trial judge found no merit on the issues raised in respect of the identity of the drug exhibits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The trial judge found that, at the time of arrest, the appellant had custody and control of the sandals containing the drugs and the prosecution could rely on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to presume knowledge of the drugs. However, even without the aid of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>, the trial judge found that based on the weight of the sandals, it was unlikely that the appellant did not know what was inside the sandals (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_548;"><i>Teh Hock Leong v. PP</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 548</LINK>); [2010] 1 MLJ 741; [2008] 4 CLJ 764. Based on the facts, the trial judge found that the irresistible inference was that the appellant had knowledge of what was in the sandals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The trial judge found that the concealment of the drugs in the sandals together with the fact that the appellant had travelled and transported the drugs to Malaysia amounted to 'trafficking' as defined in s 2 of the Act (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_70;"><i>Teuku Nawardin Syamsuar v. PP</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 70</LINK>; [2011] 3 CLJ 353 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_93;"><i>Sia Pang Liong v. PP</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 93</LINK>; [2011] 6 CLJ 759. The trial judge found that the prosecution has established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant and the appellant was thereupon called to enter his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The appellant did not deny that he had possession of the sandals at the time of his arrest. Neither did he deny that the drugs were found concealed inside the soles of the sandals. His defence was that he had no knowledge of the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> According to the appellant, he had been facing financial difficulties back home. One day his friend named 'Yasser', whom he had known for about five months, told him that he knows somebody in Tehran who has a business sending sandals and electrical stuff from Iran to Malaysia. They paid for the trip and upon return to Iran, they will pay USD2,500.00. According to the appellant, Yasser had sent many of his fellow villagers to Malaysia to deliver sandals and electrical stuff and he had paid them good money upon their return. He was told that there is a high demand for these goods because Malaysia is a hot country. The appellant said that he accepted the offer because he trusted Yasser and because he needed the money. He agreed to deliver the sandals and a hair straightener.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> About two weeks before his trip to Malaysia, Yasser brought the appellant to Tehran. The journey to Tehran by bus took about 3-4 hours. In Tehran, Yasser introduced the appellant to his friends, 'Reza' and 'Nader'. These two persons are friends of the people in Malaysia to whom the appellant was supposed to deliver the sandals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> At this meeting, Nader gave the appellant a mobile phone and said that he would call the appellant. Four days before his departure to Malaysia, Nader called him to tell him about his flight details. Nader told him that from Tehran he would go to Damascus where Nader would meet him to pass to him the sandals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The appellant travelled to Damascus. At the Tehran bus terminal, Yasser gave him USD500.00. The appellant met Nader at Damascus airport, where Nader gave him the sandals. Nader also gave him a hair straightener and USD200.00. Nader told him that the USD500.00 given to him by Yasser also came from Nader.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Nader told him the sandals were samples and he told the appellant to wear the sandals because the person who was to pick him up at KLIA would identify him by the sandals. However the name of this person was not mentioned, except that he was tall and would be wearing a black suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The appellant wore the sandals from Damascus to KLIA. He only took them off in the plane. The appellant said he found nothing unusual about the sandals except that they were too big for him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The appellant said he was shocked when he was told that there were drugs inside the sandals. He said by gestures he had informed the officers that someone was waiting for him. An interpreter was called and when the officers understood what he was saying, they removed the handcuffs, gave him back the bag and sandals and he was asked to show this person. He was allowed to walk pass the arrival hall to see if there was anyone who would come to collect the sandals, but no one came. He was then brought back into the airport. The appellant said that he had told the police about Yasser, Nader and Reza. He gave a cautioned statement (exh D45) the day after his arrest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Trial Judge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> At the end of the defence's case, the trial judge found that the appellant's story was not probable, reasonable or logical to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The trial judge said as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The trial judge found the appellant guilty as charged, convicted him and sentenced him to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Before us, the learned counsel for the appellant raised two issues which were essentially the same issues raised before the High Court, ie:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>First Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> This issue relates to the initial charge dated 29 June 2010 preferred against the appellant in which he was charged with trafficking an estimated 400 grams of methamphetamine (p 9 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In exh P36 dated 15 June 2010 prepared by PW4, it was stated that the gross weight of the sandal marked 'A' together with the drugs 'A1' was 427 grams and the gross weight for the sandal marked 'B' together with the drugs 'B1' was 363 grams (p 322 Appeal Record). The total gross weight was 790 grams. However in the chemist report, the total net weight of the crystals was stated as 405.9 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The learned counsel submitted that there was a difference in the weight of the drugs as stated in the initial charge and the weight obtained by the chemist and this, submitted by the learned counsel, raised the possibility that someone had removed the crystalline substance to obtain the gross weight as stated in the initial charge and then put the crystalline substance back into the plastic packets. The learned counsel had also referred to the oral testimony of PW6 where in re-examination, he had stated that the net weight was 465.9 grams, which counsel submitted contradicted his report in which he said it was 405.9 grams. Hence it was submitted that there was tampering of the evidence. It was further submitted that the analysis done by PW6 was flawed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) in reply submitted that there was no discrepancy because the weight of the drugs in the charge preferred against the appellant was the weight obtained by the chemist as stated in the chemist report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The learned counsel conceded before us that there was no cross-examination of PW4 and PW6 on this issue. We wish to reiterate the trite principle that failure to cross-examine a witness on a crucial part of the case will amount to an acceptance of his testimony (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_125;"><i>Wong Swee Chin v. PP</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 125</LINK>); [1981] 1 MLJ 212. The burden is on the defence to cross examine both PW4 and PW6 on this issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_1;"><i>Hasbala Mohd Sarong v. PP</i> [2013] 6 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2013] 6 MLJ 636; [2013] 6 CLJ 945; [2013] 6 AMR 324 had said in its judgment that the determining factor in the weight of the drugs is the actual weight of the drugs as determined by the chemist which forms the basis of the charge. It is common knowledge that the weighing process undertaken by the police after the seizure of the drugs is only for classification purposes in the determination of the charge that will be most likely to be preferred against the accused and/or arrested person. More often than not the disparity in weight of the drugs recorded is inevitable due to different weighing methods preferred and the different weighing apparatus used by the police force and the chemist department.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We find that, in the absence of any challenge by way of cross-examination of PW4, PW5 and PW6 regarding the weight of the drugs, the issue of discrepancies in the weight raised by the learned counsel for the appellant is devoid of any merit. We find no evidence to support the learned counsel's suggestion that the drug exhibits could have been tampered with. As correctly pointed out by the DPP, the weight stated in the charge is the same as that stated in the chemist report. In any event, the discrepancy in the weight of the drugs alone should not ipso facto cast doubt on its identity (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_9;"><i>Lew Wai Loon v. PP</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 9</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 325; [2014] 2 CLJ 649).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Second Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It was submitted by the learned counsel that there was a break in the chain of evidence which raises doubt as to the identity of the exhibits. We have perused the facts and circumstances of this case and we find that the drug exhibits were marked and identified by PW4, PW5 and PW6. PW4 had marked and signed and dated the exhibits. PW5 did the same. PW5 had custody over the exhibits until he handed them over to PW6 for analysis. Upon completion of the analysis, PW6 then handed the exhibits back to PW5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We find no evidence to suggest a break in the handling or custody of the exhibits which tantamount to a break in the chain of evidence. We have no doubt that the drug exhibits seized from the appellant and as examined by the chemist were the same drug exhibits that the appellant was charged with. In our view, the learned counsel's contention that there was a break in the chain of evidence and that the drug exhibits produced before the High Court might not be the same as the one seized by PW4 from the appellant is misconceived. We are in no doubt that the drug exhibits admitted in evidence were the same exhs seen by PW3, PW4 and PW5 and later analysed by PW6.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> There was overwhelming evidence that the appellant had custody, control and actual possession of the sandals when he was apprehended at KLIA. These facts were not challenged. The appellant had the sandals with him throughout his journey from Damascus to Malaysia. Once it had been proved that the appellant had physical control and possession and, based on the circumstances the sandals were acquired by the appellant, the trial judge was justified in finding that the appellant had mens rea possession of the drugs contained inside the sandals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We find that it was improbable for the appellant not to be suspicious about the offer made to him to carry a pair of sandals all the way to Malaysia together with a promise of a substantial sum of money for his effort, payable upon his return. Further, it beggars belief that he did not take a look at the sandals particularly when he had admitted taking them off while on the plane. We were of the view that he would have felt the bulges in the soles of the sandals when he used them. He would have also noticed the adhesive at the sides of the soles. It was the adhesive that PW3 noticed (which PW3 described as 'berkilat' or shiny) when he first inspected the sandals. Ignorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination (<i>Ubaka v. PP</i> [1995] 1 SLR 267).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Based on the manner the drugs were being carried, ie carefully concealed in the soles of the sandals to avoid detection and, taking into account the total amount of the drug involved, the trial judge was correct to apply s 2 of the Act, that the appellant was in fact carrying or conveying the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.</p>

      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We find no merit in this appeal. Having considered the totality of the evidence we were of the view that the trial judge had not erred in her findings that the prosecution has established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. We find that the defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case. Consequently we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court.</p>
