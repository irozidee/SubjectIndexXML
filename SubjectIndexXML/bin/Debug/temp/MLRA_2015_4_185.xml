    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his conviction and sentence for trafficking in dangerous drugs, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('DDA')</LINK>. At a raid at the material time, the Raiding Officer ('SP4') instructed another police officer ('SP5') to arrest the appellant who was carrying a plastic bag ('the bag'). Upon a search of the bag, two plastic packets containing granular and powdery substances ('the exhibits') suspected to be drugs were found. The exhibits were later confirmed by the chemist ('SP1') to be methamphetamine ('the drugs'). In the High Court, the appellant was found guilty and convicted and sentenced accordingly. In the instant appeal, the appellant submitted, amongst others, that there was a break in the chain of evidence; there was a disparity in the gross weight of the drugs which was not addressed by the trial judge; the exhibits were tampered with; the issue of knowledge was not proven; and this was a case of passive possession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> On the issue of a break in the chain of evidence, the trial judge had discussed and considered the issue at length and had addressed his mind correctly before coming to a finding of fact that there was no break in the chain of evidence. Moreover, the evidence of the movements of the exhibits between the witnesses was corroborated by the evidence of SP5 and other documentary evidence. (paras 5-6)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> SP1 testified on the nett weight of the drugs before analysis. Neither party had asked SP1 as to what was the gross weight of the drugs. The failure by counsel to cross-examine SP1 on this issue amounted to acceptance of the fact. Hence, the argument that there was a disparity in gross weight could not hold water at all. It was very obvious that the weight given by the police was in the form of a gross weight whereas SP1's weight was in the form of nett weight, and as such no comparison could be ascertained from them. (para 10)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Even though the trial judge did not address the issue of the disparity in the gross weight of the drugs, that by no means affected the prosecution's case. In fact, the trial judge had addressed his mind that even if there was a disparity in the gross weights of the drugs, it would not be fatal. What was important was that the prosecution successfully proved that they were the same exhibits that were seized by the police and analysed by the chemist and tendered in court. Hence, the trial judge did not commit any error in making such finding of fact. It followed that the suggestion that the exhibits were tampered with was misconceived. (paras 11 &amp; 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the trial court was right to conclude that the appellant knew that the bag contained drugs and he was in actual possession of the drugs, independent of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK>. There was no error in the trial judge's finding of fact on this issue. It was trite that an appellate court should be slow in interfering with the finding on the credibility of a witness. Here, the trial judge had rightly made a finding of fact that the prosecution witnesses were credible witnesses and was entitled to do so as he had the audio visual advantage of seeing those witnesses testifying in court whilst exhibiting their demeanour. (paras 19, 23, 24, 25, 26 &amp; 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> It was very clear in this case that the appellant was actively in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking as the amount was large, in the absence of any evidence of his own consumption or any plausible explanation given. Furthermore, the onus to consider the defence of passive possession even though it was not raised in drug trafficking cases did not fall on the judge's shoulder. Hence, there was no plausible reason to interfere with the findings, conclusion and decision of the trial judge. (paras 38, 45, 46 &amp; 48)</p>

      <b>Mohtarudin Baki JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was convicted in the High Court of Kuala Lumpur for trafficking in dangerous drugs to wit 703.8 grams of methamphetamine, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK> and was sentenced to death under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the same Act</LINK>. On appeal before us, we unanimously dismissed the appeal, and affirmed the conviction and the sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The brief facts of the case can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> This appeal is premised on the following grounds as submitted by counsel En Kamarul Hisham and co-counsel, En Hisyam Teh Poh Teik:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We will now address the first issue raised, ie the issue of purported break in the chain of evidence. As learned counsel also argued on the disparity of the weight, we feel that this will entail discussing the issue of the identity of the drug exhibits as a whole. It is trite that this issue involves question of fact and hence it depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It is our considered opinion that the learned judge had discussed and considered this issue at length and had addressed his mind correctly before coming to a finding of fact that there was no break in the chain of evidence and hence they were the same drugs that were seized, as the handling of them were properly accounted for. The learned judge had considered the movements in detail as shown at pp 22 to 23 of the Appeal Record. This was what the learned judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We find no error made by the learned judge in this finding of fact. Moreover, the evidence of the movements of the exhibits between the witnesses especially between SP4 and SP7 were corroborated by the evidence of SP5 and other documentary evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We also wish to add here that we are also satisfied with the movements of the drug exhibits between the Investigating Officer (SP7) and SP6. We hasten to add here that this court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_180;"><i>Gunalan Ramachandran &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 180</LINK>; [2004] 4 MLJ 489; [2004] 4 CLJ 551; [2004] 6 AMR 189, had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We will now look at the issue of the alleged disparity in the weight of the drugs (P9) and (P10) between that weighed by SP4 and that weighed by the chemist (SP1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We noted that the gross weight of the drugs (ie the drugs plus the packaging) as weighed by the Raiding Officer (SP4) was 1048 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The chemist (SP1) testified that the nett weight of the drugs exh (P9 and P10) before analysis was 951.4 grams. This nett weight was obtained after deducting the weight of the empty packets against the gross weight (refer to SP1's evidence at pp 55-56 of the Appeal Record). Neither party had asked SP1 as to what was the gross weight of the drugs. The failure by counsel to cross-examine will amount to acceptance of the fact. Hence we find that the argument by the learned counsel that there was a disparity in gross weight cannot hold water at all (in fact a non-starter) as it was very obvious that SP4's weight was in the form of a gross weight whereas SP1's weight was in the form of nett weight, and as such no comparison can be ascertained from them. Further it is only logical that a nett weight of an object is lesser that its gross weight.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is our considered opinion that even though the learned judge did not address this issue accordingly, this by no means has affected the prosecution's case. In fact His Lordship had addressed his mind that even if there was a disparity in the gross weights between that of the police and that of thechemist, it will not be fatal. What is important is that the prosecution has successfully proved that, those were the same exhibits that were seized by the police and analysed by the chemist and tendered in court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> This is what the learned High Court Judge said at pp 17 to 18 of the Appeal Record:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We are mindful of the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_285;"><i>Loh Kah Loon v. PP</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 285</LINK>; [2011] 4 MLJ 260, whereby the nett weight of the drugs was higher than the gross weight by 14.74 grams. This is serious as it goes against the law of nature and mathematical principles. However the Federal Court was satisfied with the testimonies of the witnesses that <i>inter alia</i>, those were the same drugs seized and that there was no break in the chain of evidence. Hence the identification of the drugs was well-established. This is what the Federal Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>[14]</b> In the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_1;"><i>Hasbala Mohd Sarong v. PP</i> [2013] 6 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2013] 6 MLJ 636; [2013] 6 CLJ 945; [2013] 6 AMR 324, the Federal Court said thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Hence we find that the learned judge did not commit any error in making such finding of fact. It follows that the suggestion advanced by the defence that the drugs exhibits have been tampered with is misconceived and remained a mere speculation as there was no evidence to that effect. Further, we find  no error in the learned judge's finding of fact that there was no break in the chain of evidence as alluded to earlier. Towards this end, we feel compelled to reproduce the finding of fact arrived at by the learned judge in this issue as stated at pp 24 and 25 of the Appeal Record thus:</p>

      <b>[16]</b> We will now proceed to the next issue raised, ie purported lack of knowledge of the appellant that he was carrying drugs. We understand it to mean that counsel is arguing on <i>mens rea</i> possession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It is trite that knowledge can only be proved by inferences from the surrounding circumstances. Relevant considerations will be based on various factors, eg conduct/reaction of the accused, from where the drugs were found, how they were recovered, the manner they were kept, weight of the drugs, the smell, etc. In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717, the Federal Court went into minute details to discuss the issue of knowledge by referring to various authorities including <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v.

    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The issue of knowledge necessary to establish possession as alluded earlier was considered in <i>Abdul Rahman Akif (supra)</i> where the Federal Court cited and referred to Lord Morris's judgment in the case of <i>Warner v.

    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Hence, in view of the above authorities, from the factual matrix above, we are satisfied that the trial court was right to conclude that the appellant knew that the plastic bag contained drugs and he was in actual possession of the proscribed drugs, independent of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA 1952</LINK>.

    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> From the cases discussed above, it is our considered opinion that the learned trial judge was right in deciding that the appellant was in possession of the drugs with knowledge (<i>mens rea</i> possession). This is what the learned judge said at pp 27 and 28 of the Appeal Record:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We see no error in the finding of fact made by the learned judge above. As a guide, some of the previous decisions of the appellate courts regarding knowledge deserve attention, are listed below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We hasten to add that the learned judge had rightly made a finding of fact that the prosecution witnesses SP4 and SP5 are credible witnesses and hence His Lordship believes in their testimonies as being credible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> His Lordship is entitled to do so as His Lordship has the audio visual advantage of seeing these witnesses testifying in court whilst exhibiting their demeanours.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Towards this end, we are mindful of the decision of the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_784;"><i>Lee Ah Seng &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 784</LINK>; [2007] 6 MLJ 1; [2007] 5 CLJ 1 where it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> This will necessarily include the testimony of SP4 who had made a police report (D20) which the defence alleged was not consistent with his testimony in court but SP4 had successfully explained the so called "discrepancy" to the satisfaction of the learned judge. The learned judge maintained his finding that SP4 is a credible witness, even though there was an attempt by the defence to impeach him. The learned judge was satisfied with the explanation given by SP4 regarding those "discrepancies", as can be seen at pp 28 to 30 (paras 47 to 48) of the Appeal Record.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We see no error in the learned judge's finding of fact on this issue. It is trite that an appellate court should be slow in interfering with the finding on the credibility of a witness. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_366;"><i>Lai Kim Hon &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 366</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 84, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1969_1_382;"><i><i>Herchun Singh &amp; Ors v. PP</i></i> [1969] 1 MLRA 382</LINK>; [1969] 1 MLJ 209 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_6_351;"><i>Kumaran Sappani v. PP</i> [2012] 6 MLRA 351</LINK>; [2011] 3 CLJ 251.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In fact in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_362;"><i>Chung Tain Kong v. PP</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 362</LINK>; [2010] 2 CLJ 397 at p 365, it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We further add, that D20 being a police report, is not a substantive evidence and it is not a conclusive document. This is so because it is unilateral and non-dispositive, in nature, as any oral evidence can be admitted to vary, add, etc from whatever is stated in the document.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Hence a witness can still give oral testimony to add to what is omitted in the report as happened to SP4 in this case. The learned judge was right when he allowed SP4 to explain the omissions and eventually was satisfied with them. We see no error in this.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1969_1_79;"><i>PP v. Foong Chee Cheong</i> [1969] 1 MLRH 79</LINK>, it was held:</p>

      <b>[35]</b> We will now deal with the last issue. Learned counsel Hisyam Teh Poh Teik argued that at most this is a case of passive possession. He referred to the following cases (i) <i>Tang Yong Seng v. PP</i> (Criminal Appeal No: J05-87-2011) (unreported), (ii) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_269;"><i>PP lwn.

Azwan Irewan Rosni</i> [2008] 3 MLRH 499</LINK>; [2009] 8 MLJ 201; [2009] 2 CLJ 536.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> After going through the appeal record, we are unanimous that there was indeed an actual possession. The accused was seen carrying the plastic bag which contained the drugs from one place to another.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We find no error in the learned judge's finding of fact that there was actual possession and not passive possession of the drugs. Before arriving at that decision His Lordship has considered all the relevant evidence. They are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We are unanimous in our decision that, it is very clear in this case that the appellant was actively in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking as the amount was large, in the absence of any evidence of own consumption, or plausible explaination given. - See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_283;">Ong Ah Chuan v. PP And Another Appeal [1980] 1 MLRA 283</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 64.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It is our considered opinion that the facts in the cases submitted by learned counsel are distinguishable from our present case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In the case of <i>Tang Yong Seng v. PP</i> where the accused was arrested whilst holding a clutch bag which contained <i>inter alia</i>, 134.42 grams methampathamine, the Federal Court substituted the conviction of trafficking to possession. Here the Federal Court held that it was not safe to affirm the conviction of trafficking because certain important factors were not considered by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, ie the strong possibility that the drugs were planted by his girlfriend Kam Hock Ping who earlier was in the rented room together with the accused. Their relationship at that point of time was sour. Further, when arrested the accused did not attempt to flee. She was not a fictitious character, as she was also arrested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_269;"><i>PP lwn. Haling Arala Jimjani</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 269</LINK>; [2008] 5 MLJ 331; [2008] 4 CLJ 163, the drugs (193.76 grams of methampatamine) were found in a small sealed packet found in a small bag tucked on the accused's waist. The learned trial judge found that the accused was in passive possession of the drug as actual (<i>mens rea</i>) possession was not proven because knowledge was not successfully proved. Hence the charge was reduced to possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2) of the Act</LINK> whereby the accused pleaded guilty. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision based on the fact that the accused has no knowledge of the drugs as the packets were sealed and cannot be seen. Further the prosecution did not challenge the fact that the small bag that contained the proscribed drugs was delivered to him by one, Sarip Sari earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2008_3_499;"><i>PP v. Azwan Irewan Rosni</i> [2008] 3 MLRH 499</LINK>; [2009] 8 MLJ 201; [2009] 2 CLJ 536, where the facts are quite similar, ie the dangerous drugs were carried by the accused are also distinguishable as there, the learned trial judge made a finding that the circumstances did not show that the purpose for which the drugs were moved was to transfer possession and that the possibility that the drugs were for personal consumption cannot be ruled out. Hence the charge was reduced to one of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39A.;;">s 39A(2) of DDA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_120;"><i>PP v. Tan Tatt Eek</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 120</LINK>; [2005] 4 CLJ 460; [2005] 6 AMR 543, the fact was also similar, ie the drugs were carried by the accused in his hand in a plastic bag. This case is also distinguishable. The High Court convicted him on trafficking but the Court of Appeal reduced it to possession, and affirmed by the Federal Court. The Federal Court agreed with the finding of the Court of Appeal that there was no factual matrix adduced by the prosecution to infer that the respondent had knowledge of the nature of the drugs in the bag. The conduct of "dropped the bag and displayed shock" when he was arrested cannot amount to knowledge by inference. Further the drugs were in a newspaper-wrapped packages and no one would be able to see through the contents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In contrast, in the present case, the evidence adduced did not show a passive possession but an actual possession. This is similar to the decisions of cases cited earlier, such as <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_2_534;"><i>Jamaludin Md Kasim v. PP</i> [2010] 2 MLRA 534</LINK>; [2010] 9 CLJ 377, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_4_60;"><i>Aedy Osman v. PP</i> [2009] 4 MLRA 60</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 810; [2010] 4 CLJ 138, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_230;"><i>Nazri Sahak v. PP</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 230</LINK>; [2010] 1 CLJ 925,<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_6_435;"><i>PP v. Reza Mohd Shah Ahmad Shah</i> [2012] 6 MLRA 435</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 490; [2010] 1 CLJ 541, etc.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Learned counsel also at the outset contended that there was a miscarriage of justice on the part of the trial judge as His Lordship had failed to consider the defence of passive possession even though it was not raised. He referred to two cases, ie <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_125;"><i>Kenneth Fook Mun Lee v. PP</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 125</LINK>; [2007] 2 MLJ 130; [2006] 4 CLJ 359; [2006] 6 AMR 361 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_1;"><i>Chan Chor Shuh v. PP</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2003] 2 MLJ 26; [2003] 1 CLJ 501; [2003] 1 AMR 748.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We are unanimous in that the contention raised is misconceived. The onus to do such exercise in drug trafficking cases does not fall on the judge's shoulder. It may apply to homicide cases as there are many legal defences and exceptions available to them, example being sudden fight, intoxication, insanity etc. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_125;"><i>Kenneth Fook Mun Lee v. PP</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 125</LINK>; [2007] 2 MLJ 130; [2006] 4 CLJ 359; [2006] 6 AMR 361 referred by learned counsel is a murder case. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_1;"><i>Chan Chor Shuh v. PP</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2003] 2 MLJ 26; [2003] 1 CLJ 501; [2003] 1 AMR 748 though a drug trafficking case, the Court of Appeal decided that "in a suitable case," a court must consider a defence even if it has not been specifically raised. Even then, the court was referring to the English case of <i>R v. Porritt</i> [1961] 3 All ER 463 which was a case of murder. As such we are inclined to follow authorities such as <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_37;"><i>PP v. Awang Raduan Awang Bol</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 37</LINK>; [1998] 5 MLJ Supp; [2005] 1 CLJ 649; [2005] 2 AMR 261 (Federal Court) and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1977_1_434;"><i>Mohamed Kunjo v. PP</i> [1977] 1 MLRA 434</LINK>; [1939] 1 MLJ 305 (Privy Council) and <i>Kenneth Fook Mun Lee (supra)</i> which are homicide cases on this issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Upon perusal of pp 32 and 33 of the Appeal Record, it is our considered opinion that the learned High Court Judge was correct in concluding, upon maximum evaluation at the end of the prosecution case, that a <i>prima facie </i>case has been made out since actual possession was proved, where thereafter the learned judge invoked <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK> for the presumption of trafficking. Likewise, we are satisfied that the defence was properly evaluated and considered by the learned judge. The learned judge did not believe the defence that the drugs did not belong to him. The defence according to the learned judge, is an afterthought and full of conjectures and inventions as the names such as Milad, Mehrdad and Ali were never raised during the prosecution's case. Hence, the learned judge cannot be faulted for arriving at a conclusion that the three names are fictitious. We also agree with the finding of the trial judge that the defence failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and that they also failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>, on a balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Having addressed all the issues raised and after evaluating them, it is our unanimous conclusion that we find no plausible reason for us to interfere with the findings, conclusion and decision of the learned judge. As such we are unanimous in concluding that the conviction is safe. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal. The conviction and sentence are hereby affirmed.</p>
