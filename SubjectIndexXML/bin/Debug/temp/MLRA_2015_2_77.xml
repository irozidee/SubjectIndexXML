    <p>The appellant together with another person was initially charged with murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code ("the Code")</LINK>. However, the prosecution offered an alternative charge of gang robbery with murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;396.;;">s 396 of the Code</LINK>. The deceased victim was a 66-year-old woman who had suffocated to death. Her hands and legs had been tied, her mouth gagged tightly with cellotape and her face and nose covered tightly with cloth. She had suffered multiple fractures to her ribcage and had also sustained numerous injuries to her head, chest, upper and lower limbs consistent with blunt force trauma. The appellant pleaded guilty to the alternative charge but his co-accused claimed trial. The appellant was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest whilst his co-accused was acquitted and discharged at the end of the prosecution's case without his defence being called. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the sentence, claiming that it was manifestly excessive.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The mere fact that the appellate court might have passed a different sentence is not a valid reason for the appellate court to interfere with the sentence. That would be an unlawful interference with the discretion vested in the sentencing court. The appellate court will only interfere if it is shown that the discretion had not been exercised judiciously in the sense that the sentence passed is illegal, or is manifestly inadequate or excessive, or that the sentencing judge or magistrate had considered irrelevant factors while ignoring relevant factors or had given insufficient or undue weight to some of the proved facts. (para 9)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The appellate court will also interfere if the sentence is not appropriate and not fitting to the circumstances of the crime or does not sufficiently reflect the gravity of the offence or public abhorrence or disapproval for that particular type of criminal conduct. A balance must be struck between the interest of the offender and the interest of the public but whatever may be the factors that the court has to consider in passing sentence, the interest of the public must take precedence over and above any other consideration. Criminal law is publicly enforced and the court owes it to the public to ensure that criminals in their midst are properly dealt with. It is wrong for the court to be lenient towards the offender without proper regard for the larger interest of the public. (paras 10-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> For what the appellant and his accomplices did, a sentence of 14 years' imprisonment was not manifestly excessive or wrong in law, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. The legislature had increased the imprisonment sentence for gang robbery with murder from 20 years to 30 years, reflecting Parliament's concern over the rise in the number of cases involving gang robbery with murder. The amendment sought to punish offenders with longer imprisonment sentences where the court is not minded to pass the death sentence. The courts being enforcers of public law must carry such object into effect and not defeat such object by imposing unreasonably lenient sentences. (paras 13-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The public will lose confidence in the courts if evildoers are not dealt with properly. The courts must therefore consistently send a clear signal to those who think of committing crimes, especially crimes of violence, that they will pay a very heavy price if they are caught and brought to justice. It is only through the sentences passed by the courts that the message will get through to the public. (para 15)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant together with another person were initially charged with murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> but after the 11th witness had given evidence the prosecution offered an alternative charge of gang robbery with murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;396.;;">s 396 of the same Code</LINK>. The appellant pleaded guilty to the alternative charge but his co-accused claimed trial. The appellant was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest while his co-accused was acquitted and discharged at the end of the prosecution case without his defence being called.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This is the appellant's appeal against the sentence. The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. The alternative charge against the appellant reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> As can be seen from the charge three persons inclusive of the appellant were involved but apparently the third person got away without being charged. The offence upon conviction carries the death penalty or imprisonment of up to 30 years and if the offender is not sentenced to death is also liable to whipping. Without a doubt the offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;396.;;">s 396 of the Penal Code</LINK> is a serious offence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The facts. On 13 September 2011 at about 1.00am, shop assistant Murugan a/l Kalairajan (SP3) had gone to the deceased's house to check out on her as she failed to turn up at her retail shop as usual that day. Her house was located just behind the shop and she was staying alone. When SP3 reached the house the front door was locked, so he entered through the back door which was ajar. As he entered the house he saw the deceased lying on the floor with her hands and legs tied. Her mouth and face were also tied, the mouth with cellotape and the face with cloth. She was already dead.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The pathologist's (SP2) evidence revealed that the late 66 year old Kaliamal a/p Kavandinia Gounder had suffocated to death, ie she died because she could not breathe. The following were SP2's physical findings on the deceased's body at the scene of crime:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> SP2 found various injuries to the deceased's head, face and neck and there were also injuries to her ribcage as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> According to SP2 the injuries on the head, chest and upper and lower limbs were consistent with force blunt trauma. In layman's term these were injuries caused by physical force with blunt objects. On being questioned by the court SP2 testified that the cellotape that covered the deceased's mouth was applied tightly around the mouth while her nose was covered with the outer layer of the cloth.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The lead that led to the arrest of the appellant was the discovery by the police forensic team of his fingerprint lifted from a bottle found in the deceased's house. Thus it was evidence left behind unwittingly by the appellant himself that enabled the Public Prosecutor to bring him to justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It is trite principle that an appellate court will not interfere willy-nilly with the sentence passed by the lower court. The mere fact that the appellate court might have passed a different sentence is not a valid reason to interfere with the sentence. That will be an unlawful interference with the discretion vested in the sentencing court. The appellate court will only interfere if it is shown that the discretion had not been exercised judiciously in the sense that the sentence passed is illegal, or is manifestly inadequate or excessive, or that the sentencing judge or magistrate had considered irrelevant factors while ignoring relevant factors or had given insufficient or undue weight to some of the proved facts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellate court will also interfere if the sentence is not appropriate and not fitting to the circumstances of the crime or does not sufficiently reflect the gravity of the offence or public abhorrence or disapproval for that particular type of criminal conduct. A balance must of course be struck between the interest of the offender and the interest of the public but whatever may be the factors that the court has to consider in passing sentence, the interest of the public must take precedence over and above any other consideration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The criminal law is publicly enforced and the court owes it to the public to ensure that criminals in their midst are properly dealt with. It is wrong for the court to be lenient towards the offender without proper regard for the larger interest of the public. I had occasion to deal with the matter of sentencing in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1720;"><i>PP v. Shahrul Azuwan Adanan &amp; Anor</i> [2012] MLRHU 1720</LINK>; [2013] 8 MLJ 70; [2013] 2 CLJ 686 where I reiterated as reproduced below what my bother judges past and present have said before:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In the present case the life of an innocent and defenceless elderly woman was cruelly cut short by a ruthless gang of robbers in the safety of her own house. Her hands and legs were tied, her mouth gagged tightly with cellotape and her face including her nose tied with cloth. The way she was treated can only be described as inhuman. There was total disregard for her safety and dignity. After tying her up the appellant and his partners in crime left her to die on the floor. It is not hard to imagine that she must have struggled in vain gasping for air before her life slipped away, not to mention the terrifying moments she had to endure when the robbers first struck.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The photos at pp 152-155 of the Record of Appeal show some extent of the appellant's and his accomplice's repulsive behaviour. For what the appellant and his accomplices did, can the sentence of 14 years imprisonment be considered to be manifestly excessive or wrong in law? We do not think so, far from it notwithstanding the fact that the appellant pleaded guilty to the alternative charge at the first available opportunity. In fact the appellant should consider himself lucky that the learned judge did not impose any sentence of whipping.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The Legislature vide <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_AMEN_2003_1210;10.;;">s 10 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2003 [Act A1210]</LINK> had in its wisdom increased the length of imprisonment sentence for this offence from 20 years to 30 years. This reflects Parliament's concern over the rise in the number of cases involving gang robbery with murder. The object behind the amendment is obvious, and that is to punish the offenders with longer imprisonment sentences where the court is not minded to pass the death sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The courts being enforcers of the law must carry this object into effect and not defeat the object by imposing unreasonably lenient sentences. These are only annoying and do not serve as a deterrent. It is counter productive and gives the wrong signal to the public. As has often been said, the public will lose confidence in the courts if evildoers are not dealt with properly. The courts must therefore consistently send a clear signal to those who think of committing crimes, especially crimes of violence that they will pay a very heavy price if they are caught and brought to justice. It is only through the sentences passed by the courts that the message will get through to the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> For reasons aforesaid we found no merit in the appellant's appeal against sentence and we therefore affirmed the sentence of 14 years imprisonment passed by the court below.</p>
