    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court dismissing its claim against the respondent pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) Electricity Supply Act 1990 ('ESA')</LINK> for loss of revenue. The appellant based its claim on the ground that the respondent had tampered with its meters placed in the basement of the respondent's shopping complex. The appellant claimed for two backdated accounts. The respondent submitted that it could not have tampered with the meters as they were in the custody and control of the appellant at all times, being placed in a locked room, which only the appellant had the keys to. Also, that the appellant did not furnish any particulars for the statement made by the appellant's representatives to base its claim on, and that only an estimated amended statement was submitted. The learned judge dismissed the appellant's claim primarily on the ground that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondent had tampered with the meters.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 ESA</LINK> the appellant need not prove that it was the customer that had tampered with the meter. It was sufficient if it could show that the meter was tampered with. In terms of quantum the appellant could rely on the certified written statement to establish its case but that did not mean that the customer could not challenge the quantum. (para 6)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> A certified written statement must contain the particulars as stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4) ESA</LINK> before service on the customer. If the customer failed to make the payment concerned, a civil action could be taken. It was therefore a condition precedent before the commencement of a civil action based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 ESA</LINK> that the appellant issue a certified written statement according to law. Also, as a matter of procedural fairness, the appellant must provide details of the statement if so requested by the respondent. If details were not given, it would be difficult for the respondent to object to the statement. The court was under no obligation to admit a statement in breach of procedural rules. In the present case, the appellant's purported written statement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> did not comply with the mandatory requirements of the law. The appellant could not rely on that statement and initiate a civil action. Furthermore, the appellant had not independently proven liability and quantum. (paras 6-7)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/plaintiff appeals against the decision of the learned High Court Judge in refusing to allow the claim related to 'tampered meter' and allowing the respondent's/defendant's counterclaim for the return of RM250,000.00 paid to the appellant under protest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The facts of the case and issues have been set out in the 15 pages' judgment of the learned trial judge and also in the submissions of the parties. We do not wish to repeat save to summarise as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant's claim is anchored on a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">38 of ESA 1990</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">Section 38</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The coram consisting of Balia Yusof Wahi JCA, Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA and Badariah Sahamid JCA had the opportunity to deal with similar issues in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_6_666;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad v. Ternakan Air Wui Kyee Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2015] 6 MLRA 666</LINK>; [2015] 5 CLJ 955; [2015] 4 AMR 507 in detail. For good measure this judgment must be read with that to avoid repetition. What was held by the Court of Appeal in both cases abovementioned can be briefly summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> What is important to note under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38</LINK> is that, Tenaga is not deprived of making a claim against its customers for breach of contract and/or tort for loss of revenue in consequence of a tampered meter. If they do so they must prove that the customer tampered with the meter and in consequence Tenaga suffered loss of revenue. That is to say Tenaga must prove according to law the liability as well as quantum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> However, if Tenaga relies on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38</LINK>, they need not prove that the customer tampered the meter. It is sufficient if they can show that the meter has been tampered. In terms of quantum they can rely on certified written statement to establish their case. That does not mean the respondent cannot challenge the quantum. For the appellant to rely on a written statement, the following must have taken place:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We have read the Appeal Record and the able submissions of the parties. After much consideration to the submissions of the appellant, we take the view that the appeal must be dismissed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> For reasons stated above we do not find any merits in this appeal. This appeal is dismissed with costs of RM50,000.00 to the respondent. Deposit is to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
