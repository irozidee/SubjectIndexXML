    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The applicant had flown into LCCT from Jakarta on 11 May 2008, carrying several educational audio compact discs ('the publications') for her personal religious edification. A Customs Officer then on duty, seized the publications on the basis that they contained the word 'Allah'. The applicant was on the same date, served with a "Notice of Detention of Goods issued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_235;102.;;">s 102 of the Customs Act 1967</LINK>". The applicant subsequently received a letter dated 7 July 2008, to the effect that the Ministry of Home Affairs ('the Ministry') had decided to withhold and confiscate the publications. The letter was signed by one Suzanah bte Haji Muin ('Suzanah') identifying herself as a Senior Authorised Officer. The applicant subsequently filed an ex parte application for judicial review to challenge the decision of the Minister of Home Affairs ('Minister'). The applicant applied for <i>certiorari</i> to quash the decision of the Ministry to seize and confiscate the publications and for <i>mandamus</i> to compel the 1st respondent to return the publications to the applicant. The applicant also sought various declaratory reliefs in relation to, <i>inter alia</i>, her constitutional rights of freedom of religion and education ('the other prayers'). The High Court granted leave for the application and subsequently only allowed the applicant's prayers for <i>mandamus</i> and <i>certiorari</i>. The applicant's prayers for the other reliefs were dismissed. The respondents were dissatisfied with the granting of the <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>, whereas the applicant was dissatisfied with the non-granting of her other prayers. The respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal and the applicant cross-appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the respondents' appeal and allowing the applicant's cross-appeal in part):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court judge had correctly decided that whilst <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 ('the Act')</LINK> authorised any senior officer to make an interim order to withhold suspected published materials from being imported into Malaysia, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> specifically empowered the Minister to issue a final order regarding the same. The power of the Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> could not in law be exercised by any other persons. The inter-play between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> and as to who their main protagonists were, could not be clearer than that. They involved a two-tier exercise, first <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A</LINK> by the senior authorised officer, to be followed by an order of the Minister, if the situation so warranted, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was nothing in the letter dated 7 July 2008 that would convey the Minister's decision on the fate of the publications. Further, the affidavit-in-reply affirmed by the (former) Minister for Home Affairs only confirmed that Suzanah had acted in a manner that was consonant with the law and with the applicable government policy since 1986. There was nothing in the (former) Minister's affidavit that stated that he was the person, who had made the required decision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>. Neither had he averred that Suzanah was merely communicating his decision made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK>. (paras 27-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The legislative framework set up in the Act was entirely clear. There was clear demarcation between the power given to the Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK> and the power bestowed upon the senior authorised officer under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A of the Act</LINK>. There was nothing stipulated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> indicating that the power of the Minister could be delegated to a subordinate authority. Neither was there any evidence led by the respondents to the effect that such delegation was indeed made. The fact of the matter was that there was no getting away from the cardinal principle so entrenched in the public law domain that the exercise of a statutory power could only be exercised in the manner as intended by the legislature as expressed in the statutory provisions. In the absence of any other positive averment to the effect that Suzanah was acting on clear instructions by the former Minister that she was only communicating his decision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>, the Court of Appeal would agree with the finding of the judge that it was Suzanah who had made the permanent withholding order and not the Minister. (paras 31-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The letter dated 7 July 2008 that purported to confiscate the publications belonging to the applicant was one that was bad in law. It was done <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> as it was made by a person, to wit Suzanah, who was not the person envisaged by the Parliament as the competent person empowered to make that order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>. The evidence in the instant case supported the finding that this had been a classic case of <i>ultra vires</i>, where a public official had acted in excess of what the law had authorised her to act. The wordings in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> were so clear that they did not allow any room for a suggestion to be made, let alone be heard, that any person other than the Minister could issue the permanent withholding order as envisaged thereunder. (paras 33-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> On the ground of clear <i>ultra vires</i> alone, the order contained in the letter, would be enough to dismiss the appeal by the respondents, as one without any merit. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Any prayer that had sought to challenge the prohibition of the use of the word 'Allah', following the majority decision of the Federal Court in <i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors</i>, must not be done in a collateral manner. The enactment which had contained the prohibition on the use of the word 'Allah' had to be challenged specifically for want of jurisdiction. The impugned provisions in the enactment could not be challenged in isolation, as was done in the instant case. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> There were prayers sought by the applicant that were not inextricably tied down specifically with the use of the word 'Allah'. Those prayers related to the declarations that were sought through prayers (c) and (d) of the applicant's application. Since those issues involved scrutiny of the affidavit evidence before any finding could be made, it would be prudent if the case be remitted back to the High Court for those prayers to be considered in light of the affidavit evidence before another judge.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> We had heard both parties on 23 April 2015. At the end of the hearing, we had indicated to the parties that we needed time to deliberate before coming to a decision. This is now our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This matter had emanated from the decision of the High Court sitting at Kuala Lumpur. It concerns a judicial review application filed by one Jill Ireland Lawrence Bill ('the applicant') that had sought to challenge the purported decision of the Menteri Bagi Kementerian Dalam Negeri that had led to the withholding and ultimate confiscation of the eight publications in the form of CD ("the publications") belonging to the applicant pursuant to the alleged exercise of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 ("the Act")</LINK>. Both the Menteri Bagi Kementerian Dalam Negeri and by extension, the Government of Malaysia had been cited as respondent 1 and respondent 2 by the applicant in her application respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Factual Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The applicant is a Malaysian citizen. She is a Melanau from Sarawak and she professes the Christian faith. The cause papers show that the applicant uses Bahasa Malaysia in all aspects of her profession and practice of Christianity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 11 May 2008, the applicant landed at the Sepang Low Cost Carrier Terminal ("LCCT") from Jakarta, Indonesia, bringing along with her eight Christian educational audio compact discs ("the publications"), for her personal religious edification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> A customs officer who was on duty then, had detained the publications on account that they had carried the word "Allah" in each of the eight titles. The applicant was served with a "Notis Penahanan Barang-Barang Di Bawah <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_235;102.;;">s 102 Akta Kastam 1967</LINK>" on the same date. The notice sets out the address of the agency for reference, ie Kementerian Keselamatan Dalam Negeri, Bahagian Kawalan Penerbitan dan Teks Al Qur'an, cawangan KLIA, Selangor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Subsequently, the applicant had received a letter dated 7 July 2008 (as at p 160 of the Core Bundle) which contained, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[<LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">AMCP 1984</LINK> referred to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Akta Mesin Cetak dan Penerbitan 1984</LINK> and is the Act in English.]</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Lampiran K referred to in para 2 in the letter dated 7 July 2008 is the list of the eight publications that had contained the word "Allah" in each of them and it also contained the reasons assigned for the confiscation of the various titles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The letter dated the 7 July 2008 was signed by one Suzanah bte Hj Muin whose position has been described as 'Pegawai Kanan Berkuasa' in the said letter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Applicant's Legal Challenge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision, the applicant had on 20 August 2008 filed an ex parte application for leave for Judicial Review ("JR") under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of Rules of the High Court 1980 ("RHC")</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;25.;;">s 25 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 ("CJA")</LINK> against the 7 July 2008 decision at the High Court at Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 4 May 2009, leave was granted by the learned High Court Judge for the court to hear the substantive application where the applicant had sought the following reliefs:</p>

      <b>[11]</b> On 21 July 2014, the High Court Judge allowed only prayers (a) and (b) of the reliefs that were sought by the applicant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Both parties were apparently aggrieved by the judge's decision in their own way, as reflected in their cause papers filed before us. The respondents were dissatisfied with the granting of the orders of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> against respondent 1. As for the applicant, she was aggrieved by the non-granting by the judge of prayers (c), (d), (e), (f), (h), (i) and (j) in the application. The respondents had since filed in their appeal against the judge's decision and the applicant had also filed her cross-appeal against the impugned parts of the same decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Before we had proceeded to hear the matters in the appeals, there was a motion that was filed by Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan ("MAIWP") to be made as interveners in this appeal. While the respondents did not make any particularly strong stand on the matter, for or against, the applicant had objected to this motion in encl 6a. Having heard submissions by parties, we had unanimously dismissed encl 6a as it was not brought under the proper provisions in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;;">Rules of Court 2012 ('ROC 2012')</LINK> pertaining to the application to be made as interveners in a judicial review matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> This encl 6a was filed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;15;SN6.;;">O 15 r 6 of the ROC 2012</LINK>. We had agreed with the learned counsel for the applicant that the mode of filing encl 6a was fatally flawed. It should have been done by invoking <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN8.;;">O 53 r 8 of the ROC 2012</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> High judicial authority can be found in support of that proposition in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_453;"><i>Majlis Agama Islam Selangor v. Bong Boon Chuen &amp; Ors</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 453</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 307; [2009] 6 CLJ 405 ("the <i>MAIS</i> case"). In light of those specific provisions contained in r 8 therein, the provisions contained in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;15;SN6.;;">O 15 r 6 of the ROC 2012</LINK>, which are of general applications, are thereby superseded. The legal maxim <i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i> would apply in full force, whereby the maxim seems to suggest that the court would prefer specific provisions over general ones where the provisions conflict.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We wish to reproduce what learned justice Zukefli Ahmad Makinudin FCJ (as he then was) had said in the MAIS case (supra):</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> However, we had allowed MAIWP to attend this court proceedings as 'watching brief' and that it could be heard by the court on invitation as amicus curiae by the court in exercise of its discretion, during the hearing of the main appeal. We therefore had dismissed encl 6a with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal And Cross-Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> For the purpose of the appeal and cross-appeal, the parties will be referred to as they had appeared in the High Court. We had proceeded to hear submissions by the respondents first. The respondents' appeal was against the granting of prayers (a) and (b) including costs of RM5,000.00, followed by the applicant's cross-appeal against the dismissal by the learned judge of prayers (c), (d), (e), (f), (h), (i) and (j) of the reliefs sought.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The respondents' appeal was premised on the following considerations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Nevertheless before us, the learned Senior Federal Counsel ("SFC") had indicated to us that he would be focusing on the issue that the impugned order to confiscate the eight publications belonging to the applicant was in fact properly made by the Minister himself. Meaning that the order as embodied in the letter to the applicant dated 7 July 2008 was valid and that as such, the learned High Court Judge was wrong in deciding otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In order to appreciate the granting of prayers (a) and (b) of the application by the learned judge, one has to go back to look at the order by the learned judge as to why the <i>certiorari</i> was granted to quash the purported decision of the Minister that was said to be done in exercise of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> and the order of <i>mandamus</i> to compel the Minister to return the publications to the applicant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> After establishing that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> confers power only to the Minister to issue the necessary order on permanent confiscation of the publications and that such power could not in law be exercised by any other persons, the learned judge had said at p 8 of her judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In the course of coming to that conclusion, she had dissected <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A of the Act</LINK> and had concluded that while <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A</LINK> authorises any senior authorised officer to make an interim order to withhold suspected published materials from being imported into Malaysia, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK> specifically empowers the Minister to issue a final order regarding the same. The learned judge had rightly noticed the distinction intended and we are of the view that she was right in that regard. In fact, such intention is clearly seen as expressed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A</LINK> itself where it states, "he may withhold delivery of such publication pending the decision of the Minister to deal with it as provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK>." The inter-play between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK> and as to who their main protagonists are, cannot be clearer than that. They involve a two-tier exercise, first <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A</LINK> by the Senior Authorised Officer, to be followed by an order of the Minister, if the situation so warrants, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It was also argued before us by the learned SFC that the evidence as per the relevant affidavits had shown that the letter dated 7 July 2008, although signed by Suzanah bte Hj Muin, a Senior Authorised Officer, ("Suzanah"), she had so signed as she was just communicating the decision of the Minister to the applicant. In other words, Suzanah did not decide under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK> but that she was only informing or conveying to the applicant what had been decided by the Minister. It was also submitted before us by the learned SFC that the principle in the case of <i>Carltona Ltd v. Commissioners of Works &amp; Ors</i> [1943] 2 All ER 560 ought to apply in the circumstances of this case. His submissions on this point were articulated as follows, as can be seen in his written submissions at pp 51-52:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As such, it was urged before us by the learned SFC that the learned judge had erred when she found as a fact that the decision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK> had been made by Suzanah instead of it having been made by the Minister.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In this regard, we had to look at the letter dated 7 July 2008 itself to see whether such submission by the learned SFC could be sustained. That letter appears at p 160 of the respondent's Core Bundle. It was clearly signed by Suzanah bte Hj Muin, a Senior Authorised Officer, from the Home Affairs Ministry. Paragraph 2 of the letter said that in exercise of the powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9(1) of the Act</LINK>, the Ministry ("Kementerian") had decided to withhold the publications as appeared in the annexure marked 'K' for reasons as stated therein. It was signed off by Suzanah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The learned SFC had tried to impress upon us that this decision was made by the Minister himself and that Suzanah was only instructed to convey that decision made by the Minister. We were, as was the learned judge, referred to the affidavit of the then Minister which according to the learned SFC would dispel all doubts surrounding the decision maker in this case. First, we only need to say that there was nothing stated in the letter dated 7 July 2008 that would convey the meaning that Suzanah was directed by the Minister to convey the Minister's decision on the fate of the publications. Secondly, para 2 spoke of the decision of the 'Kementerian' as opposed to the decision of the 'Minister' as envisage by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>. As regards the affidavit, the relevant averment as contained in para 10 of afidavit jawapan responden affirmed by Syed Hamid b S Jaafar Albar (as at p 133 of respondent's core bundle), reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It is clear that the said affidavit by Syed Hamid, who was the former Minister responsible for Home Affairs only went as far as confirming that Suzanah had acted in a manner that was consonant with the law and with the applicable government policy in place since 1986. We noted that there was nothing in the said former Minister's affidavit that had stated that he was the person, as the then Minister, who had made the required decision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>. Neither had he averred that Suzanah was merely communicating his decision made under that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> How did the learned judge deal with this aspect of the learned SFC's contention? For that, we would advert to her judgment at p 718 of the Appeal Records, where she had said as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Reverting to the submissions by the learned SFC on the case of <i>Carltona Ltd (supra)</i>, it was apparent to us that his written submissions were developed from what was said by Lord Greene MR in that <i>Carltona Ltd</i> case (<i>supra</i>). This was what the learned Master of the Rolls had said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> With respect, the factual matrix obtained in this instant appeal presents an entirely different scenario in that the legislative framework that has been set up in the Act is entirely clear. There is clear demarcation between the power given to the Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9</LINK> and the power bestowed upon the senior authorised officer under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A of the Act</LINK>. We noted that there was nothing stipulated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> indicating that the power of the Minister could be delegated to a subordinate authority. Neither was there any evidence led by the respondents to the effect that such delegation was indeed made. The fact of the matter is that there is no getting away from the cardinal principle so entrenched in public law domain that the exercise of a statutory power may only be exercised in the manner as intended by the legislature as expressed in the statutory provisions. We would, with respect, agree with the learned counsel for the applicant in his submissions before us when he said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In the absence of any other positive averment to the effect that Suzanah was acting on a clear instruction by the former Minister that she was only communicating his decision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>, we are with respect, constrained to agree with the finding of the learned judge as quoted above that had appeared in para 13 in her judgment. Having so found, the submission put forth by the learned SFC before us could not therefore be sustained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The net result of this conclusion by us, would mean that the letter dated 7 July 2008 that purported to confiscate the eight publications belonging to the applicant is one that was bad in law. It was done <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> as it was made by a person, to wit Suzanah bte Hj Muin, who was not the person envisaged by the Parliament as the competent person empowered to make that order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>. One of the grounds identified by Lord Diplock in the <i>Council of Civil Service Unions &amp; Ors v. Minister for the Civil Service</i> [1985] AC 374 ("<i>CCSU</i>'s case") upon which a decision of a public official, of which a Minister is one such official, may be quashed by the court in a judicial review proceeding is that the impugned decision is devoid of legal basis. In other words, it is <i>ultra vires</i> and is therefore illegal. In the instant appeal, the learned judge had concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> With respect, we agree with the learned judge on that score. Suzanah was the perfectly clothed officer in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9A.;;">s 9A of the Act</LINK> where she was fully competent to issue an interim order to withhold suspected printed materials which fell within the contemplation of that section. But, to put it mildly, she was ill-equipped to issue an order that was envisaged to be issued by a Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK>. The evidence in this case supported the finding of the learned judge that this has been a classic case of <i>ultra vires</i>, where a public official, as in our instant case had acted in excess of what the law had authorised her to act. The wordings in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;9.;;">s 9 of the Act</LINK> are so clear that they do not allow any room for a suggestion to be made, let alone be heard, that any person other than the Minister can issue the permanent withholding order as envisaged thereunder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The learned counsel for the applicant had in his submissions forwarded alternative grounds for saying that the order made purportedly in the letter dated 7 July 2008 must be bad in law. Indeed, we had occasion to consider them. But suffice in our view to say, that on the ground of clear <i>ultra vires</i> having been established alone, the order contained in the said letter, would be enough to provide this court with the necessary justification to dismiss the appeal by the respondents, as one that is without any merit. As such, the appeal by the respondents is hereby dismissed. The learned judge's orders in respect of prayers (a) and (b) are hereby affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Cross-Appeal By The Applicant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The applicant's case is premised on the following points:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We must revert to the judgment of the learned judge to see how she had dealt with the applicant's prayers which she had subsequently declined to grant. That must necessarily lead us to p 719 of the Appeal Records. It was contained in para [16] of her judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In para [17] of her judgment, the learned judge had gone on to say as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> With respect, we agree with her, partially. We agree with her that any prayer that had sought to challenge the prohibition of the use of the word 'Allah', following the decision of the majority in the Federal Court in the <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_205;"><i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 205</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 765; [2014] 6 CLJ 541, must not be done in a collateral manner. The enactment which had contained those prohibition on the use of the word 'Allah' has to be challenged specifically for want of jurisdiction. The impugned provisions in the enactment cannot be challenged in isolation, as was done in this case. To that extent we would agree with the learned judge's decision on the applicant's prayers that were not granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> However, we noted that there were prayers that were not inextricably tied down specifically with the use of the word 'Allah', especially those which were predicated upon the deprivation of freedom of religion (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;11.;;">art 11</LINK>) and the right to equality or freedom from discrimination (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8</LINK>) which we believe, could and ought to have been dealt with by the learned judge, but were not. That would relate to the declarations that were sought for as contained in prayers (c) and (d) of the application. The learned counsel for the applicant had invited us to make a decision on those issues. Nevertheless, we would with respect agree with the learned counsel for MAIWP (watching brief) that as these issues involved scrutiny of the affidavit evidence before any finding could be made, it would be prudent if this case be remitted back to the High Court for those prayers to be considered in light of the affidavit evidence before another judge. This approach will also ensure that the parties are not deprived of their constitutional right of appeal on findings of fact as well as findings of law by the court of first instance, the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Premised on the above, we hereby allow the cross-appeal by the applicant in part, by us making the following varying order that this case be remitted back to the High Court to hear and consider the applicant's:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Having heard the parties, we make no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Order accordingly.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
