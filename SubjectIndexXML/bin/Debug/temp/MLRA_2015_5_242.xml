    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his conviction and sentence to death under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> for murdering the deceased. At the end of the trial, the trial judge held that the defence had not cast any doubt on the prosecution's case and accordingly the charge against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In this appeal, the appellant advanced three principal grounds why the finding of guilt made against him and the sentence imposed by the High Court should be reversed: there was no direct evidence implicating the appellant to the commission of the crime and the trial judge was wrong in admitting and/or relying on the dying declaration or statement allegedly made by the deceased to PW9; the prosecution had failed to adduce a crucial witness, one Nozariah binti Talib ('Nozariah') who was at the house where the alleged stabbing of the deceased took place; and there was no basis on the facts for the trial judge to hold that the 'spear' recovered was the murder weapon, as alleged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It had been accepted that under Malaysian law the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> was wider than the common law rule where a 'dying declaration' must relate exclusively as to the cause of the death itself. Under Malaysian law, the statement in question might relate to the cause of the deceased's death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in that death; however, such a statement should not be remote in point of time. Further, such a dying declaration or statement need not be corroborated by some other evidence. In the instant appeal, the defence failed to show why or on what reasonable basis PW9's testimony relating to the dying statement made by the deceased to her ought to have been disregarded by the trial judge. Therefore, the trial judge had not misdirected himself in law or on the facts in placing reliance on the dying statement made by the deceased to PW9 which not only identified the appellant as the person who inflicted the injuries, but also the 'transaction', ie the stabbing that led to injuries that subsequently resulted in the deceased's death. (paras 37, 38 &amp; 41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The prosecution had informed the court that reasonable attempts were made to trace Nozariah but she could not be located. Further, even by the appellant's own evidence in defence, Nozariah was in the kitchen preparing dinner when the admitted scuffle between the appellant and the deceased had taken place. The investigation by the police immediately after the incident as disclosed by the prosecution witnesses was that Nozariah was in the kitchen when she heard the deceased crying out after being stabbed. In the circumstances, Nozariah was not a critical or crucial witness to the happenings on the night of the incident. Any evidence she would have given would not have had any material consequence on the ultimate decision reached by the trial judge. (paras 42-44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Upon an evaluation of the judgment of the trial judge, this court found that he had directed himself correctly as to the law on circumstantial evidence as the basis for the conviction of the appellant. In this instance, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence before the trial court to hold, firstly, that the appellant had used the spear to stab the deceased and secondly, that the injuries inflicted by the appellant using the spear was the direct cause resulting in the death of the deceased. (paras 48 &amp; 51)</p>

      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appeal before us was against the conviction and sentence to death by hanging, handed down by the High Court at Tawau on 18 May 2012. The charge brought against the appellant was the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> After having heard 11 witnesses, the High Court had at the close of the prosecution's case ruled that a<i> prima facie</i>
case had been made out against the appellant. The appellant opted to give evidence on oath and was the sole witness for the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the end of the trial, the learned judge held that the defence had not cast any doubt on the prosecution's case and accordingly the charge against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Before us, the appellant advanced three principal grounds why the finding of guilt made against him and the sentence imposed by the High Court should be reversed. They were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 9 September 2014 we had heard counsel for appellant and the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor and having considered both their oral and written submissions, we were of the unanimous view that the High Court was not in error in finding the appellant guilty as charged. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence. We now set out the grounds for our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The deceased, Bubus (or Bobos)(aka Andres Sumingut Jamarolin) was a tenant of a room at the ground floor of the house owned by PW9 where the incident had taken place. PW9 lived on the upper floor and at about 8.30pm on 14 March 2009, she had heard a cry for help. She went down the stairs and saw the deceased holding his right chest and covered with blood. The deceased at that point told her that 'Ray' (as the appellant was also known) had stabbed him and he needed help to go to the clinic.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> PW9 contacted PW7 for assistance. PW7 came over with her husband to the house in question. PW7 saw the deceased at the veranda of the house holding his right chest and he was bleeding. PW8 who was in his house (about 100 metres away) who also came over to give assistance, found the deceased bleeding and clutching his right ribs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> PW9, PW7 and PW8 then rushed the deceased in the car belonging to PW7's husband, first to Tawau Clinic and then to Tawau Hospital. The deceased did not have any traceable pulse upon arrival at the Hospital and was pronounced dead thereafter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant who stayed at PW8's house (whenever he was back from the timber camp where he worked) fled the scene of the crime but was later apprehended by PW11, a police officer investigating the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b>Initial information as to the stabbing incident at Kampung Rancangan Kalabakan was received by PW4, the Officer-in-Charge at Kalabakan Police Station. PW4 had rushed over to the scene after informing the Investigation Officer, PW10.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b>PW10 subsequently went over to the scene after informing his superior PW3, the Senior Investigation Officer. While conducting inspection there, PW10 found a spear (exh P19A) outside the fence of that house where the stabbing had taken place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The post-mortem on the deceased was conducted on 20 March 2009 by PW1, the Forensic Pathologist, in the presence of PW3. The deceased was identified by his wife. It was PW1's finding that the cause of death was Hypovolaemic Shock (due to massive loss of blood) as a consequence of the stab wound on the right front of the chest which pierced the right lung, liver and colon. The stab-wound injury suffered by the deceased was fatal and consistent with that caused by a sharp weapon probably one which had a double edge such as a keris or spear. It was also PW1's opinion that it was unlikely that the deceased could have been saved if he was brought to hospital earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant in his defence claimed that on the fateful evening he had been drinking with PW8 and some friends at PW8's house. He had then gone over to the PW9 is to see a lady known as 'Ria' (Nozariah binti Talib) and was then invited by the latter to join for dinner. 'Ria' was preparing dinner, when allegedly the deceased, who was earlier seated on a sofa watching TV, left the room but then returned suddenly and attacked him. According to him, he then grabbed a piece of wood to defend himself from the deceased when he (the appellant) was pushed against a wall. He was then chased out of the house and he threw away the piece of wood.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant's version was essentially that he had been merely defending himself. He denied he went there armed with a spear with intention to find the deceased. The appellant did confirm that he had seen a spear at PW8's storeroom (although he initially denied having seen the spear before or taken it from there). Nevertheless he agreed that the spear was a sharp weapon that could cause serious injury to a person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The appellant however disagreed that he ran away after stabbing the deceased. His answer, as highlighted by the learned judge was that he could not remember the events that had happened to him after the incident at PW9's house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> As also highlighted by the learned judge in the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17] </b>
In his evidence the appellant also stated that PW9 was his girlfriend and PW9's mother had scolded him about the affair the appellant had been having with PW9. It was claimed that PW9 was the one who had told the appellant that it was the deceased who informed PW9's mother about the relationship between the appellant and PW9. It was admitted by the appellant that about two weeks before the stabbing incident, there was a verbal quarrel between the appellant and the deceased about this matter. This was confirmed by PW9 when she was cross-examined.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b>Despite the appellant's claim that he was forced to stab the deceased with the wood when he was pushed against the wall by the deceased, the ensuing</p>
    <p>police investigation revealed that there were no blood stains found at the wall, where allegedly this had occurred. Blood stains were found only on the sofa in the room. The post-mortem revealed that the stabbing had been inflicted from the top downwards along the front right chest of the deceased indicating that the deceased was in all probability still in a sitting position when the stabbing took place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Judgment Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> At the close of the prosecution case, the learned judge had analysed the evidence led before the court and held that the essential ingredients to prove a charge of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300(c)</LINK> had been made out. On the authority of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_459;"><i>Sainal Abidin Mading v. PP</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 459</LINK>; [1999] 4 MLJ 497; [1999] 4 CLJ 215; [1999] 4 AMR 4277, the learned judge identified the four ingredients that were required for a conviction, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> One issue raised at that stage of the proceedings was as to the identity of the deceased considering that there had been differences in the way the victim had been addressed or known. In respect of this issue the learned judge's finding was expressed in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned judge also was satisfied that the deceased had died as a result of the injuries sustained based on the testimony of PW1 (the forensic pathologist) and the post-mortem report (exh P5). As per this evidence, the major and critical injury suffered by the deceased was a stab wound measuring</p>
    <p>between 2.7 x 1.4 cm (about 3 cm long when the margins were closed) oriented vertically on the right outer front of the chest about 17.5 cm to the right of midline and along 125 cm above the heel. Both the ends of the wound were sharply cut. The wound was directed to the left and downward cutting the underlying intercostal muscle, the sixth ribs, the lower lobe of the right lung, the right hemi-diaphragm, the liver, the omentum and hepatic fixture of the colon. The estimated depth of the wound was 16.5 cm. This stab wound injury suffered by the deceased was fatal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On this issue, the court went on further to state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In addressing the third ingredient, the learned judge held that through circumstantial evidence it had been proven that the injuries sustained by the deceased were caused by the appellant, who was known to PW8 and PW9 as 'Ray'. The dying declaration or statement made by the deceased to PW9 identifying 'Ray' as the person who had stabbed the deceased was accepted by the court. The deceased had gone on further a little later (after seeking assistance to go to the clinic) to also say to PW9 'I do not know what I have done wrong'; this the court held showed that the deceased was still aware and lucid of what he was doing and was not under any shock or delusion when the statements were made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned judge went on to state as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The prosecution case had also shown that the appellant was the last person together with the deceased and the spear, (exh P19A) seised by PW10 outside the fence of PW9's house at the crime scene on the same day, matched the description of the possible murder weapon (as opined by PW1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The court held that these aforesaid evidence led to the irresistible inference and reasonable conclusion that the appellant had caused the injuries suffered by the deceased. In coming to that conclusion, the court noted that the law did not require a dying declaration to be corroborated by any other evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As regard the requirement that the prosecution had to also prove that the appellant had the intention of causing the victim's death or had such intention to cause such bodily injuries as the appellant knew was likely to cause the death of the deceased as a natural consequence, the court observed that such intention had to be inferred from the appellant's acts and surrounding circumstances. The court referred to the leading authorities on this area of the law and stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_172;"><i>PP v. Sanin Othman</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 172</LINK>; [2011] 5 MLJ 716; [2011] 1 CLJ 626 is another illustration of inference of intention from the nature of the wound:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> With respect to the nature of the weapon used and intention, the learned judge stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> There were two defences raised by the appellant when his defence was called. They were 'drunkenness' and 'provocation'. With regard to the first defence, the court found that the drinking (by the appellant) was voluntary and with the other surrounding evidence, were insufficient to establish a defence of intoxication under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;85.;;">ss 85(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;86.;;">86(2) of the Penal Code</LINK>. The appellant had also failed, it was held, to discharge the onus placed upon him under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;105.;;">s 105 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> to prove the state of intoxication such as to negate the appellant's intention or <i>mens rea</i> to cause the fatal injury the deceased had succumbed to.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As to the second defence it was noted by the learned judge that there was no evidence that the deceased had made any threats against the appellant (other than a mere verbal quarrel two weeks before the stabbing incident), such as to cause the appellant to be defensive with the deceased. It was further held by the learned judge as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The court also made reference to the following important aspects of the sworn evidence of the appellant in defence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The learned judge in his judgment set out the following excerpts for the appellant's evidence in defence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The leaned judge held that in all the circumstances the defence's attempt "... to set up the defences of drunkenness, provocation, sudden fight, self-defence and excessive self-defence (was) not supported by the facts adduced by DW1 [the appellant]. The accused's [appellant's] defence has not been able to cast any doubt on the prosecution's case".</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before Us And Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Before us the defences of intoxication, provocation/sudden fight and self-defence raised at the trial were no longer pursued by the appellant. This appeal was confined by the appellant to the three grounds as enumerated at para 4 above of this grounds of decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>No Direct Evidence/Court Was Wrong In Admitting The Dying Declaration</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The question before us was whether the learned judge was wrong in admitting and relying on the dying declaration made by the deceased to PW9 to the effect that he (the deceased) had been stabbed by the appellant. It needs to be reiterated at the outset that the learned Judge in evaluating the immediate statement made by the deceased to PW9 on the stairs, noted that this statement was made when the deceased was lucid, meaning that it was not made in any state of delusion impairing his cognitive faculties. In support of this there was also the further statement by the deceased made to PW9 - 'I do not know what I have done wrong' which clearly indicated that the deceased was at the material time mentally alert and fully conscious.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">Section 32(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, in so far as it related to dying declaration provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It has been accepted in our law that the scope of that provision is wider than the common law rule where a 'dying declaration' must relate exclusively as to the cause of the death itself. In our law, the statement in question may relate to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in this death; such statement should however not be remote in point of time.</p>
    <p>In <i>Evidence, Practice and Procedure</i> by Augustine Paul (3rd edn), at p 329 the learned author (and a former judge of the Federal Court) has instructively noted as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It is also the law here that such a dying declaration or statement need not be corroborated by some other evidence. The same learned commentator in <i>Evidence, Practice and Procedure</i> above cited, goes on at p 335 to state:</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>[39]</b> In his written submission learned Deputy Public Prosecutor, Awang Armadajaya Awang Mahmud had dealt with the aforecited opinion of the Privy Council in <i>Nembhard v. R</i> [1982] 1 All ER 183 and we consider it appropriate to reproduce that part of the submission <i>in extenso</i> here:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In dismissing the appeal, the Privy Council held that "there was no rule or law or practice whereby a special warning about the absence of corroborative evidence had to be given where the only evidence implicating the accused consisted of a dying declaration, and that the trial judge had discharged his general duty to leave the jury with a clear consciousness of the need for care in assessing the significance of a dying declaration".</p>
    <p>At pp 185, 186-187, Sir Owen Woodhouse expressed the following opinion on the unlikeliness of falsehood in a dying declaration, and on caution in admitting statements of dead person:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> This position in law has been reaffirmed by our Court of Appeal in the recent case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_59;"><i>Seraman A Adipan v. PP</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 59</LINK>; [2009] 5 CLJ 123, where the deceased had made the 'statement' to several persons. The Court of Appeal endorsed the learned High Court Judge's finding there in that case that so long as it could be determined that the deceased had made it and that he had the 'capacity and clarity' of mind, it was absolutely safe to accept the oral or written statement of a deceased as to the cause of his death or to any circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death.</p>
    <p>(The aforesaid Court of Appeal decision has since been affirmed by the Federal Court.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It was not shown to us why or on what reasonable basis PW9's testimony relating to the dying statement made by the deceased to her ought to have been disregarded by the learned judge. The court had held her to be a reliable and consistent witness without any predisposed grudge or ill will against the appellant. We were of the view therefore that the learned judge had not misdirected himself in law or on the facts in placing reliance on the dying statement made by the deceased to PW9 which not only identified the appellant as the person who inflicted the injuries, but also the 'transaction' - the stabbing - that led to injuries that subsequently resulted in the deceased's death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Non-Availability Of Nozariah As Witness</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> It must be pointed out that the prosecution had informed the court that reasonable attempts had been made to trace this witness but she could not be located. This was not a situation therefore where it could be imputed that the prosecution was suppressing the evidence of this witness, for any adverse inference to be drawn.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> More importantly however, even by the appellant's own evidence in defence, this witness (Ria) was in the kitchen (preparing dinner) when the admitted scuffle between the appellant and the deceased had taken place. The investigation by the police immediately after the incident as disclosed by the prosecution witnesses was that this witness was in the kitchen when she heard the deceased crying out after being stabbed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the circumstances, we did not see how Nozariah binti Talib was a critical or crucial witness to the happenings at that night in or about the living room of the premises. Any evidence she would have given would not have had any material consequence on the ultimate decision reached by the learned judge in the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The question then was whether there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to implicate the appellant with the stabbing of the deceased using a dangerous weapon, as established by the post-mortem report and evidence of PW1. This was best dealt with together with the third ground in appeal raised by the appellant before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Spear (Exhibit P19A) As The Murder Weapon</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> It was the contention of the appellant that there was no basis for the learned judge to hold that the 'spear' (exh P19A) was the murder weapon used by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The learned judge in his analysis of the evidence led before the High Court, especially the appellant's testimony in defence, highlighted the fact that the appellant had not denied that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned judge also in his judgment noted that the appellant was evasive and inconsistent in his testimony with regard to the use of the 'wood' and events subsequent to the incident when he was cross-examined by the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In our evaluation of the judgment of the learned judge, we found that that the learned judge had directed himself correctly as to the law on circumstantial evidence as the basis for the conviction. The learned judge stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The principles governing the acceptance of circumstantial evidence to convict an accused have been laid down in numerous cases including <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1965_1_38;"><i>Sunny Ang v. PP</i> [1965] 1 MLRA 38</LINK>; [1966] 2 MLJ 195, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_20;"><i>Jayaraman Velayuthan &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 20</LINK>; [1982] 2 MLJ 306; [1982] CLJ 130, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2005_1_567;"><i>PP v. Magendran Mohan</i> [2005] 1 MLRH 567</LINK>; [2005] 6 MLJ 6; [2005] 3 CLJ 592, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1962_1_32;"><i>Chan Chwen Kong v. PP</i> [1962] 1 MLRA 32</LINK>; [1962] MLJ 307, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1967_1_416;"><i>Karam Singh v. PP</i> [1967] 1 MLRA 416</LINK>; [1967] 2 MLJ 25 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1967_1_123;"><i>Chang Kim Siong v. PP</i> [1967] 1 MLRA 123</LINK>; [1949] 1 MLJ 109. The principle gleaned from those authorities was that a conviction based on circumstantial evidence was good in law if the cumulative effect of all evidence leads to an irresistible conclusion that it was the accused who committed the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Suffice it here to reproduce some guiding excerpts from the aforecited authorities, to support that position. In <i>Sunny Ang</i>'s case (where the deceased's body was never found) the Federal Court noted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thomson CJ's comments in <i>Chan Chwen Kong</i> were in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In <i>Karam Singh</i>, Ong Hock Thye FJ stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And in <i>Chang Kim Siong</i>, the Federal Court emphasised that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> There was on the totality of the evidence before the trial court therefore sufficient circumstantial evidence to hold, firstly, that the appellant had used the 'spear' to stab the deceased and secondly, that the injuries inflicted by the appellant using the spear was the direct cause resulting in the death of the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> For the reasons discussed above, we were not convinced that the learned judge had committed any error on the facts or in law or that the conviction and sentence was not safe in all circumstances of the evidence before the High Court. There was no valid reason shown for us to interfere with the conviction and sentence and accordingly, we were unanimous in dismissing this appeal.</p>
