    <p>These two related appeals before the Federal Court involved similar issues of law and it was agreed that the outcome in Civil Appeal No: 03(F)-5-12- 2012(W) would bind Civil Appeal No: 03(F)-6-12-2012(W). The appellant, a judgment debtor, obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court on the following questions of law: (i) whether, upon a proper interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1) (i) of the Bankruptcy Act 1967 ('BA 1967')</LINK>, prior leave of court was required as per <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC 1980')</LINK> (or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_328;31.;;">O 31 r 2 of the Subordinate Courts Rules 1980</LINK>) when a judgment creditor issued a bankruptcy notice ('BN') after six years had lapsed from the date of judgment; and (ii) whether the observation of the Federal Court in <i>Perwira Affin Bank Bhd v. Lim Ah Hee</i> ('<i>Lim Ah Hee</i>') that such prior leave of court was not required, was decided <i>per incuriam</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeals with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The outcome of this appeal turned upon the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, the effect of which was that a judgment creditor who had obtained a final judgment or final order against a judgment debtor for any amount and execution thereon not having been stayed was entitled to commence a bankruptcy proceeding against the judgment debtor. The words "execution thereon not having been stayed" in that provision were significant. Given that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> was almost an exact duplicate of s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act 1883 and s 1(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act 1914, the English authorities were therefore relevant on the meaning and application of the said words. (paras 9 &amp; 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The English cases of <i>Re ex parte Woodall</i> ('<i>Woodall</i>'), <i>Re Ide, ex parte Ide</i> ('<i>Ide</i>') and <i>Re Connan</i>, <i>ex parte Hyde</i> stated that the creditor must be in a position, when he issued the BN, to levy immediate execution upon the judgment, should he choose to levy execution. The said cases did not state that bankruptcy was a form of execution and therefore had to comply with the rule of court relating to execution. It was upon interpretation of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" that the English courts reached the said result. The rule of court relating to execution was only referred, to see if the creditor, when he issued the BN, was in that position to issue immediate execution upon the judgment, if he chose to. (paras 23-24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b>
      <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> held that a bankruptcy proceeding was not execution, and that a bankruptcy proceeding was an "action" within <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">s 2 of the Limitation Act 1953 ('the LA 1953')</LINK> and therefore caught by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3)</LINK> of the same. However, <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> did not state and did not rule on the meaning of the words, "execution thereon not having been stayed" as there was no discussion on the meaning of those words. The issues in that case had nothing to do with the meaning of the said words in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. That case dealt with the applicability of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> to bankruptcy proceedings, and the validity of a BN where the judgment debtor had not disputed the claim stated in the BN within seven days from the date of service of the BN. However, in ruling that a bankruptcy proceeding was not execution, <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> might perhaps have implied that a bankruptcy proceeding need not comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 of the RHC 1980</LINK>. But <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> did not state that leave was not required to issue a BN, where six years had lapsed since the date of the judgment or order. (paras 40 &amp; 42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The recent Federal Court case of <i>Ambank (M) Berhad v. Tan Tem Son &amp; Another Appeal</i> ('<i>Tan Tem Son</i>') had dealt with the words "execution thereon not having been stayed". But that case erred in deciding that the absence of the proviso in s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act 1883 (similar to the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>) at the material time when <i>Woodall and Ide</i> were decided, militated against the reasoning in those cases. The significant purpose of the proviso (inserted later into the Act) was to obviate the result as in <i>Woodall</i>, where it was held that the executor of the creditor was not a proper person to issue the BN. The proviso did not add anything to or take anything away from the meaning of the words, "execution thereon not having been stayed". Hence, it did not matter that when <i>Woodall and Ide</i> were decided, s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act 1883 did not contain the proviso similar to that of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. (paras 48-49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> A bankruptcy proceeding was not execution. But the right of the creditor to issue bankruptcy was pegged to the right of the creditor to proceed to execution. A creditor was not entitled to issue bankruptcy if he was not in a position to issue execution on his judgment at the time when he issued the BN. (para 50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The English courts only referred to s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act 1883 to construe the meaning of the words, "execution thereon not having been stayed". No rule of court was applied. The rules of court were only referred to see if the creditor, when he issued the BN, was in the position to issue immediate execution upon judgment, if he chose to. If by reason of the rules of court or on account of some valid legal reason, a creditor was in no such position when he issued the BN, the creditor then had no right to issue bankruptcy. (para 51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The weight of authorities clearly established that the creditor must be in a position to issue immediate execution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. <i>Woodall</i> was the first and the foremost authority to follow on the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed", the meaning of which should be construed in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, and not from the perspective of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">Section 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> should not be read to nullify <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the RHC 1980</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">Order 46 r 2(1)(a) of the RHC 1980</LINK> was not incompatible with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>. What it all come to was this: (1) an action upon a judgment should not be brought after the expiration of 12 years from the date that the judgment became enforceable; (2) no arrears of interest in respect of any judgment debt should be recovered after the expiration of six years from the date on which the interest became due; and (3) a writ of execution to enforce a judgment or order might not issue without leave of the court where six years or more had lapsed since the date of the judgment or order. (paras 53-54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Whether a bankruptcy proceeding was an action upon a judgment was not an issue before this court. But it would appear that the definitive word on it might still be unsaid. <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> held that a bankruptcy proceeding was an action upon a judgment. But if a bankruptcy proceeding were an action upon a judgment, then it could not be brought after the expiration of 12 years from the date that the judgment became enforceable. If brought within 12 years, the creditor must then be in a position to issue immediate execution. (para 55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b>
      <i>Tan Tem Son</i> had clearly departed from history and case law. There was no alternative but to put it back in line with other jurisdictions with a provision equipollent to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. The reasoning in that case could not be subscribed to. Also, this court could not agree that "any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment" in the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> did not require a judgment creditor to obtain leave pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the RHC 1980</LINK> prior to initiating a bankruptcy proceeding based on a final judgment obtained more than six years ago. (paras 56-57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> The consent judgment in the present case was obtained on 10 October 2000. The BN was issued on 3 January 2011 by which time the judgment was more than six years old. When the BN was issued, the respondent, the judgment creditor, was not in a position to execute the judgment without leave of court. Leave should and could have been obtained by the respondent, the failure of which resulted in the respondent being not in a position to execute the judgment and therefore not entitled to issue the BN. In conclusion, a judgment creditor who commenced bankruptcy proceedings after more than six years had lapsed from the date of the judgment, must obtain prior leave of court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the RHC</LINK> (now <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;46;SN2.;;">O 46 r 2 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>). The answer to the first leave question was in the positive, which could dispose of the appeal. It was therefore not necessary to answer the second leave question. (paras 57-58)</p>

      <b>[1]</b> These two related appeals, which involved similar issues of law and so were heard together, are against the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 29 May 2012 which dismissed the appellant's appeals with costs. Leave to appeal was granted by this court on 21 November 2012 (that is, before the decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_425;"><i>Ambank (M) Berhad v. Tan Tem Son &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 425</LINK>; [2013] 3 MLJ 179; [2013] 3 CLJ 317; [2013] 3 AMR 285) on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We need only to deal with Civil Appeal No: 03(F)-5-12-2012(W), as it was agreed that the outcome in the latter appeal would bind Civil Appeal No: 03(F)-6-12-2012(W).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The pertinent facts may be briefly stated as follows: By a consent judgment dated 10 October 2000, the appellant was ordered to pay RM554,000.00 to the respondent, by way of the following instalments: (a) RM54,000.00 to be paid on or before 15 November 2000, followed by (b) consecutive monthly payments of RM20,000.00 each, from 15 November 2000 until full settlement. The appellant failed to settle the judgment sum. The respondent issued a certificate of indebtedness which stated that the appellant owed the sum of RM350,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 3 January 2011, the respondent issued a bankruptcy notice for the sum of RM350,000.00, and had the same served on the appellant on 4 January 2011. The appellant applied to set aside the bankruptcy notice on the ground that the bankruptcy notice was invalid and liable to be set aside <i>ex debito justitiae</i>, it being issued without the leave of court as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (RHC)</LINK>. On 15 September 2011, the learned Senior Assistant Registrar dismissed the appellant's application to set aside the bankruptcy notice. The appellant appealed to Judge in Chambers. On 9 November 2011, the learned judge dismissed that appeal with costs. Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim J (as he then was) held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, where the issue was whether the issuance of a bankruptcy notice requires prior leave of court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the RHC</LINK> (since replaced by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;;">Rules of Court 2012</LINK>) where six years or more have lapsed since the date of the final judgment. On 29 May 2012, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court. Linton Albert JCA, delivering the judgment of the court, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The Court of Appeal held itself constrained to follow <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_392;"><i>Perwira Affin Bank Bhd v. Lim Ah Hee</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 392</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 253; [2004] 2 CLJ 787; [2004] 3 AMR 699, even though it perceived that what was enunciated by Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ, as he then was, delivering the judgment of the court, on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1) of the RHC</LINK>, in relation to bankruptcy proceedings, was obiter. We observe, that in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i>, all issues on whatever requisite leave under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1) of the RHC</LINK> were abandoned by the judgment debtor at the stage of appeal to Judge in Chambers (see <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> at 394) and the leave questions had to do with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Limitation Act 1953 (LA 1953)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(2)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act 1967 (BA 1967)</LINK> (see <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> at 395).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant urged us to revisit the issue. He submitted that <i>Tan Tem Son</i>, which was decided shortly after leave was given to the appellant to lodge the instant appeal, and <i>Lim Ah Hee</i>, were wrongly decided. He further submitted that in those two decisions, the court took the simplistic approach, to wit, that a bankruptcy proceeding is not execution and that therefore <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the RHC</LINK> does not apply to a bankruptcy proceeding. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent contended that albeit that the dicta of this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1) of the RHC</LINK> was obiter, yet it was the conclusion of this court in <i>Tan Tem Son</i> that <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> correctly stated the law, and that as such we should not disturb <i>Tan Tem Son</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In our considered opinion, the outcome of this appeal turns upon the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) the BA 1967</LINK> is that a judgment creditor who has obtained a final judgment or final order against a judgment debtor for any amount and execution thereon not having been stayed is entitled to commence a bankruptcy proceeding against the judgment debtor. That provision, it would seem, should be straightforward enough. But that has not proved to be so, as the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" have been differently interpreted by different courts, such that the learned authors of <i>Malaysian Civil Procedure 2013</i> at para 46/2/1 thus curtly commented:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We need to correct the aforesaid para 46/2/1. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_650;"><i>Tan Chwee Hock v. Ambank (M) Bhd</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 650</LINK>; [2012] 4 MLJ 159; [2012] 8 CLJ 905 was not a decision of the Federal Court. It was a decision of the Court of Appeal, where it was unanimously held that the enunciation in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 RHC</LINK> was obiter and where it was held, by a majority, that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 RHC</LINK> applies to bankruptcy proceedings. In so far as this court is concerned, (1) it held in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> that a bankruptcy proceeding is not execution but an action upon a judgment within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>, and, (2) it held in <i>Tan Tem Son</i> that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1) of the RHC</LINK> does not apply to a bankruptcy proceeding which is an action upon a judgment within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>, that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1) of the RHC</LINK>, which does not apply to a bankruptcy proceeding, could not be employed to construe the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" to mean that in addition to there being no stay of execution, the creditor must be in a position to issue immediate execution, and that the only bar to the institution of bankruptcy proceedings is the limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Until the advent of <i>Tan Tem Son</i>, a judgment creditor was entitled to commence a bankruptcy proceeding against the judgment debtor, if the judgment creditor could issue immediate execution upon the judgment or order. The history to that began after the English Bankruptcy Act of 1869. Section 6 of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1869 listed six acts of bankruptcy upon which a creditor might present a petition for the bankruptcy of the debtor (see <i>The Law Reports, Statutes</i>, 1869, at pp 399-400). But none of those six acts of bankruptcy bore semblance to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. That was because the modern system of bankruptcy laws was in the main introduced by the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883 (see <i>Stephen's Commentaries on the Laws of England</i>, 21st edn, vol III, chapter 12, at 189). The present form of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1) of the BA 1967</LINK> first appeared in s 4(1) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883, which repealed the English Bankruptcy Act of 1869. The words "execution thereon not having been stayed" first appeared in s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883, which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Those words "execution thereon not having been stayed" remained wholly unchanged in s 1(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1914 (as amended by the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Act of 1926). "The Acts of 1914 and 1926 ... constitute a code which regulates the conditions under which bankruptcy can occur, the procedure by which a person is adjudicated bankrupt, the legal effect of bankruptcy, and its termination" (<i>Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice</i> by Fridman, Hicks and Johnson at p 3).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Soon after the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883, the Straits Settlements introduced Ordinance No 44 (Bankruptcy) of 1888, wherein, s 3(1)(i) provided:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The Federated Malay States enacted Enactment 2 of 1912, to provide for proceedings in bankruptcy, and the Bankruptcy Enactment of 1921 to replace Enactment 2 of 1912. Section 4(i)(i) in both Enactments of 1912 and 1921 identically provided:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> All separate bankruptcy legislation of the Federated Malay States, Straits Settlements, and Johore enacted before the Federation of Malaya Agreement 1948 were repealed by the Bankruptcy Ordinance of 1959 (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1970_1_421;"><i>Rengasamy Pillai v. Comptroller Of Income Tax</i> [1970] 1 MLRA 421</LINK>; [1968] 2 MLJ 42 per Lord Diplock), which, in turn, was replaced by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Bankruptcy Act 1967</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> But despite the comings and goings of Acts, Enactments and Ordinances, from the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883 to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;;">Bankruptcy Act of 1967</LINK>, the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" remained wholly intact and unchanged in all said English Bankruptcy Acts, FMS Enactments, SS Ordinances and the Bankruptcy Ordinance of 1959, always in a provision equipollent to s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883. " ... those words have remained in the English and Commonwealth legislation substantially unchanged from 1883 to the present day" (Re <i>Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson</i> [1975] 38 FLR 184 at 188 per Riley J). Those words now appear in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, which is equipollent to s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883. Given that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> is almost an exact duplicate of s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883 and of s 1(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1914 (otherwise an exact duplicate if not for the <i>mutatis mutandis</i> changes), the English authorities on the English Bankruptcy Acts of 1883 and 1914 are therefore relevant on the meaning and application of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In construing the words "execution thereon not having been stayed", the English courts referred to O 42 r 23 of the English Rules of the Supreme Court 1883 which provided:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The meaning of s 4(1) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883 was first considered by the Court of Appeal in <i>Re ex parte Woodall</i> [1884] 13 QBD 479, where the executor of the judgment creditor served a bankruptcy notice on the judgment debtor. The executor had not obtained leave from the court, under r 23 of Order XLII of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 1883, to issue execution on the judgment. The bankruptcy notice was not complied. The executor presented a bankruptcy petition against the judgment debtor. The registrar made a receiving order. The debtor appealed. It was argued for the executor that r 23 of Order XLII applied only to issuing execution on the judgment and had no relation to proceedings in bankruptcy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Baggallay J held that the words "and execution thereon not having been stayed" tend to show that the creditor must be a person who is in a position to issue execution upon the final judgment.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In <i>Re ex parte Ide</i> [1886] 17 QBD 755, the creditor obtained judgment against the firm and execution could immediately issue against the property of the firm. The plaintiffs presented a bankruptcy petition entitled, "In re Leon M Ide and Edward Godfrey Ide, trading as Ide &amp; Co" The petition, which alleged that "Leon M Ide and Edward Godfrey Ide, trading as aforesaid," had committed an act of bankruptcy by non-compliance with the bankruptcy notice, was served on Leon M Ide who gave notice of his intention to oppose the making of a receiving order against him. The creditor argued that execution could issue against the member of the firm, as that member had been served with the writ, and was therefore within the meaning of cl (c) of r 10 of Order XLII.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Lord Esher, MR held that the member was a person against whom a creditor had obtained a final judgment, but against whom the creditor could not issue execution without leave. On s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883, Lord Esher said that the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" implied that the "judgment must be one upon which execution could go immediately":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In <i>Re Connan, ex parte Hyde</i> [1886-90] All ER Rep 869, the judgment creditor obtained a final judgment against the debtor, but the debt was attached by a garnishee absolute. The bankruptcy notice was served when the debt was attached. The Court of Appeal was unanimous that the creditor was not a person who had obtained a final judgment on which execution had not been stayed. Fry and Lopes LJJ, who delivered separate judgments, put it as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The ratio that determined the outcome in those three English cases was not that bankruptcy was a form of execution and therefore had to comply with the rule of court relating to execution. Rather, the ratio was that the creditor must be in a position, when he issued the bankruptcy notice, to levy immediate execution upon the judgment, should he choose to levy execution. In <i>Woodall</i>, Baggallay J held that the words "and execution thereon not having been stayed" tend "to shew that the creditor must be a person who is in a position to issue execution upon the final judgment", Cotton LJ said that they meant "that the creditor must be in a position to issue execution", while Lindley said those words "shew ... a creditor who is in a position to issue execution on the judgment". And in <i>Ide</i>, Lord Esher MR enunciated that the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" implied that the "judgment must be one upon which execution could go immediately", and Bowen LJ said "that in order to entitle a creditor to issue a bankruptcy notice, he must be in a position to issue execution on his judgment at the time when he issues the bankruptcy notice .... must be in a position to issue immediate execution upon it".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It was upon interpretation of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" that the English courts reached the result. "For the issue of bankruptcy notice to be valid, the creditor must be in a position to levy execution ... " (Sales's <i>The Law Relating to Bankruptcy, Liquidations and Receiverships</i> 6th edn, p 16). The rule of court relating to execution was only referred, to see if the creditor, when he issued the bankruptcy notice, was in that position to issue immediate execution upon the judgment, if he chose to. That was the approach of the English court, even decades later, in <i>James v. Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV and Another</i> [1986] 3 All ER 179, that is, up and until the advent of the English Insolvency Act of 1986 "which swept away the concept of "acts of bankruptcy" and replaced it with a single concept, to wit, the inability of the debtor to pay ... The statutory demand procedure was introduced ... This brings individual insolvency more in line with the corresponding provisions in relation to limited companies" (see <i>Personal Insolvency: A Practical Guide</i> by Grier and Floyd, 2nd edn at 1.20).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As said, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> is almost identical with s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883 and with s 1(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1914. The enunciation by English courts on the meaning and application of the English provisions are therefore eminently relevant. Accordingly, in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1934_1_215;"><i>In Re SMRM Sithamparam Chettiar; Ex Parte Sundra Singh</i> [1934] 1 MLRH 215</LINK>, Mudie J relied on <i>Woodall</i> and <i>Ide</i> and allowed the motion to set aside the bankruptcy notice on the ground that the creditor was not in a position to proceed with execution.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Henceforth, <i>Woodall</i> and/or <i>Ide</i> were cited, whenever the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> was called into question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_29;"><i>Low Mun v. Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 29</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 263; [1987] CLJ 172, where the main issue for determination was whether a bankruptcy notice for a specified sum and also an unspecified sum of interest might be founded under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, the former Supreme Court per Mohamed Azmi SCJ, later FCJ, enunciated as follows:</p>

Clement Skinner JC, touched on the historical background:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Hence, it has for ages been that at the time of issue of the bankruptcy notice, the judgment creditor must be in the position to issue execution.</p>

      <b>[31]</b> Then came <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> and <i>Tan Tem Son</i>, which allegedly departed from history and case law, and broke ranks with jurisdictions which shared the legacy of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883. But was that indeed so?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In <i>Lim Ah Hee</i>, the judgment creditor obtained judgment against the judgment debtor on 23 October 1987. In 1996, the judgment creditor took out a bankruptcy notice ('BN') and had the same served on the judgment debtor. The judgment debtor raised a preliminary objection that the sum demanded was wrong, in that it included a statute-barred debt. The High Court dismissed the preliminary objection. The Court of Appeal allowed the judgment debtor's appeal. The judgment creditor obtained leave to appeal on the following questions: (a) whether the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> was relevant and applicable to bankruptcy proceedings; and (b) whether the BN was valid under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(2)(ii) of the BA 1967</LINK> if the judgment debtor did not dispute that the claim stated in the BN was excessive within seven days from the date of service of the BN.</p>

      <b>[33]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">Section 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> provided that "An action upon any judgment shall not be brought after the expiration of 12 years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable and no arrears of interest in respect of any judgment debt shall be recovered after the expiration of six years from the date on which the interest became due". The issue in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> was whether the arrears of interest sought to be recovered ran counter to the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>. Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ, as he then was, fully appreciated that:</p>

      <b>[34]</b> From paras 19 to 41 of its judgment (the preceding paragraphs merely recited the facts and submission of learned counsel), this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> then deliberated on the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">LA 1953</LINK>, in particular on 'action' as defined in s 2, on the question as to whether a bankruptcy proceeding is a 'suit' or a 'proceeding in court', on the rule of court relating to execution, and, on an action upon a judgment. In those paragraphs, this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> held that the case of <i>WT Lamb &amp; Sons v. Rider</i> [1948] 2 KB 331, which was not a bankruptcy case, was authority that a plaintiff who has a judgment more than six years is not entitled to issue execution upon it except with the leave of court (see para 31), that a bankruptcy notice or bankruptcy petition is not a writ of execution (see para 31), that the net effect of <i>Lowsley and another v. Forbes</i> [1998] 3 WLR 501, which was not a bankruptcy case, was (1) an action upon a judgment must be brought within six years [s 24 of the English Limitation Act of 1980 provided that an action upon a judgment shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable], (2) "execution of judgment is not subject to a limitation period. However, leave must be obtained if the execution is to be done after the period of six years", and, (3) even if it is by way of execution of a judgment, interest may only be recovered for a period of six years (see para 40).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> From paras 41 to 44 of its judgment, this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> (1) reflected on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_95;"><i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Ernest Cheong Yong Yin</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 95</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 385; [2002] 2 CLJ 413; [2002] 2 AMR 1803, which was a bankruptcy case, where the appellant obtained a summary judgment on 15 October 1987 with interest from 1 April 1986 until full realisation, where the appellant, on 24 January 1996 (eight years and three months after the judgment) filed a bankruptcy notice but only claimed interest for six years from the date of the judgment, and, (2) held that Ernest Cheong assumed that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> applied (see para 42). At para 43 of its judgment, this court in Lim Ah Hee then touched, fleetingly, on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_119;"><i>Moscow Narodny Bank Ltd v. Ngan Ching Wen</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 119</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 693; [2004] 2 CLJ 241; [2001] 4 AMR 4801.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> On the issue at hand (see para 45), that is, whether the arrears of interest sought to be recovered ran counter to the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>, this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> said:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In relation to those self-posed questions, this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> answered:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> At para 58 of its judgment, this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> thus answered the first leave question:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> However, this court in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> declined to answer the second leave question (see para 76).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> But that which became increasingly apparent as <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> was examined was this. <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> held that a bankruptcy proceeding is not execution, and that a bankruptcy proceeding is an action within the meaning of 'action' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">s 2 of the LA 1953</LINK> and therefore caught by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>. But <i>Lim Ah Hee</i><b>did not say and did not rule</b>, for there was no discussion or ruling on the meaning of the words 'execution thereon not having been stayed', <b>that a judgment creditor, when he issued the BN, must be or need not be in a position to issue immediate execution</b> [Emphasis Added]. In <i>Lim Ah Hee</i>, that was not the issue. As Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ had put it, "Lest I get carried away, I should remind myself that I am only dealing with the issue whether the second limb [of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3)] of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> is applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. The High Court in this case held it does not and the Court of Appeal held it does. The answer really lies in the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3)</LINK> itself." The issues in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> had nothing to do with the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. Rather, the issues in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> had to do with the applicability of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> to bankruptcy proceedings, and the validity of a bankruptcy notice where the judgment debtor had not disputed the claim stated in the BN within seven days from the date of service of the BN.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b>
      <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> had not ruled on the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, and so could not have departed from history and case law. Indeed, we could agree with <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> (1) that a bankruptcy proceeding is not 'a writ of execution' within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 RHC</LINK>, as "The issue of a bankruptcy notice is not a form of execution (<i>Re a Bankruptcy Notice</i> [1898] 1 QB 383). However, it is said that the creditor must be in a position to issue execution in order to issue a bankruptcy notice, the words of s 1(1)(g) being 'execution thereon not having been stayed" (see <i>Weaving's Notes on Bankruptcy in County Courts</i>, 7th edn at p 5), (2) that "if execution is to be done after six years leave of court must be obtained", and, (3) that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> should be read together as a whole.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Perhaps, when <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> ruled that a bankruptcy proceeding is not an execution, it implied that a bankruptcy proceeding need not comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 of the RHC</LINK>. But <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> did not say that leave is not required to issue a bankruptcy notice, where six years have lapsed since the judgment or date of the order. Hence, with respect, we could not agree with the trial court that it was held in <i>Lim Ah Hee</i> that "a bankruptcy proceeding is not executionary proceedings in the sense that it is a continuation of a judgment and that no leave is required to issue the bankruptcy notice after six years".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The case that dealt with the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" was <i>Tan Tem Son</i>, where the leave questions read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In <i>Tan Tem Son</i>, it was directly asked whether the words 'any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment' in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, require a judgment creditor to obtain leave pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the RHC</LINK> before he could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding that is based upon a final judgment obtained more than six years ago, or, whether a judgment creditor could issue bankruptcy without the leave of court, where the final judgment was obtained more than six years ago.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> At paras 34 and 35 of its judgment (the preceding paragraphs merely recited the facts and submission of learned counsel), this court in <i>Tan Tem Son</i> thus made out the leave questions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> First and foremost, this court in <i>Tan Tem Son</i> made the following observations and or rulings: <i>Abigroup Ltd v. Abignano</i> [1992] 112 ALR 497 was of no assistance in the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> (see para 36). The cases referred to in the first leave question, namely, <i>Liew Kong Ken</i>, <i>Re Haji Ahmad, Re Low Tung Kwai, Tengku Iskandar, Tan Ah Tong and Re Lee Che Pah</i>, all relied upon <i>Re V Gopal</i> and/or <i>Wee Chow Yong</i>. The dicta in <i>Low Mun</i>, which case was not concerned with the issuance of bankruptcy notice upon a judgment more than six years old, and the dicta in <i>Chan Sin</i>, where the critical issue was limitation, to the effect that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> a judgment creditor must be in position to issue execution, were obiter. <i>Re V Gopal</i> and <i>Wee Chow Yong</i> relied upon <i>Woodall</i> and <i>Ide</i> (see paras 38-43). It was held in <i>Ide</i> that a creditor who obtained judgment against a firm but not the requisite leave under O 42 r 10 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883 to issue execution against a person alleged to be a member of the firm, could not serve such person with a bankruptcy notice under s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1883 (see para 44).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> At paras 46 and 47 of its judgment, this court in <i>Tan Tem Son</i> imparted its first comments on <i>Ide</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> But it was only at para 50 of its judgment, that this court in <i>Tan Tem Son</i> revealed its reasoning for its disapproval of <i>Woodall</i> and <i>Ide</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> We do not dispute that when <i>Woodall</i> and <i>Ide</i> were decided, s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 did not contain the proviso similar to the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. But we fail to appreciate how the absence of that proviso to s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 could militate against the reasoning in <i>Woodall</i> and in <i>Ide</i>. The purpose of the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, which reads "Provided that for the purposes of this paragraph and of s 5 any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment or final order shall be deemed to be a creditor who has obtained a final judgment or final order", is to obviate the result as in <i>Woodall</i>, where it was held that the executor of the creditor was not a proper person to issue the bankruptcy notice. But that proviso does not add anything to or take anything away from the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed". Hence, it does not matter that when <i>Woodall</i> and <i>Ide</i> were decided, s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 did not contain the proviso similar to the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> It is however pertinent that apart from the proviso, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> is in <i>pari materia</i> with s 4(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883 and with s 1(1)(g) of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1914, and as such, due regard should be given to the enunciation by English courts on the meaning and application of the English provisions. And in connection with that, we do not believe that <i>Woodall</i> and/or <i>Ide</i> could be distinguished merely because of the fact that the creditors in <i>Woodall</i> and <i>Ide</i> were not creditors within the meaning of s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883, or because <i>Woodall</i> and/or <i>Ide</i> had nothing to do with leave to execute a judgment that is more than six years old. In both <i>Woodall</i> and <i>Ide</i>, the question was whether the creditor was in a position to proceed to immediate execution of the judgment. In <i>Woodall</i>, the question was whether the executor of the creditor was a creditor within the meaning of s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883. In <i>Ide</i>, the question was whether the creditor could issue execution against a member of the firm. In both cases, the issue had nothing to do with leave to execute a judgment that was more than six years old. But nevertheless, to answer the question whether the creditor was a creditor within the meaning of s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883, the court in <i>Woodall</i> and in <i>Ide</i> had to construe the meaning of the words "If a creditor has obtained a final judgment against him for any amount, and, execution thereon not having been stayed". To settle the question as to whether the creditor was entitled to issue the bankruptcy notice against the debtor, the court in <i>Woodall</i> and in <i>Ide</i> had to spell out the meaning of those words. And in relation to the identity of the creditor who could issue bankruptcy, the English courts were crystal clear. In <i>Woodall</i>, the court enunciated that the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" "shew that the creditor spoken of must be a person who is in a position to issue execution upon the final judgment" (per Baggallay J) or meant "that the creditor must be a position to issue execution" (per Cotton and Lindley LJJ). In <i>Ide</i>, the court held that the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" implied "that the judgment must be one upon which execution could go immediately" (per Lord Esher), meant "that in order to entitle a creditor to issue a bankruptcy notice, he must be in a position to issue execution on his judgment at the time when he issues the bankruptcy notice" (per Bowen LJ), or showed that the creditor "must be a creditor who is on a position to issue execution on the judgment" (per Fry LJ). To settle the question as to whether the petitioning creditor was entitled to issue the bankruptcy notice against the debtor, the court in <i>Woodall</i> and in <i>Ide</i> clearly enunciated that a creditor is entitled to issue bankruptcy if he is in a position to issue execution on his judgment at the time when he issues the bankruptcy notice. A bankruptcy proceeding is not execution. But the right of the creditor to issue bankruptcy is pegged to the right of the creditor to proceed to execution. A creditor is not entitled to issue bankruptcy if he is not in a position to issue execution on his judgment at the time when he issues the bankruptcy notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> It should be observed that in relation to its enunciation on the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed", the English courts only referred to s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883. No rule of court was applied by the English courts to construe the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed". As said, the rules of court were only referred by the English courts, to see if the creditor, when he issued the bankruptcy notice, was in that position to issue immediate execution upon the judgment, if he chose to. But from <i>Woodall</i> came forth the principle that a creditor is entitled to issue bankruptcy only if he is in a position to issue execution on his judgment at the time when he issues the bankruptcy notice. And that principle holds true, despite the difference between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the RHC</LINK> and O 42 r 23 of the English Supreme Court Rules of 1883, despite the difference in the bankruptcy rules, and or despite the difference in the facts. If by reason of the rules of court or on account of some valid legal reason, a creditor was in no position to issue execution at the time when he issues the bankruptcy notice, then the creditor has no right to issue bankruptcy. It is as simple as that.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> That was the principle that was followed in <i>Re: ex parte Follows</i> [1895] 2 QB 521, where goods taken in execution were claimed by a third party before the sheriff made a return and an interpleader summons was pending, and where it was held by Vaughan Williams J (Wright J concurred) that a bankruptcy notice could not be issued for a sum of money for which execution could not issue, in <i>Re: ex parte Ford</i> [1887] 18 QBD 369, where goods taken in execution were claimed by a third party and an interpleader order was made under which the sheriff withdrew from possession, and where it was held by Cave J that there was in substance a stay of execution until the issue in the interpleader was decided and that in the interim the creditor was not in a position to issue execution, in <i>Re: ex parte Feast</i> [1887] 4 Morrell's Bankruptcy Reports 36, where Bowen LJ opined that "as long as the judgment is available for execution it is available for bankruptcy, in <i>Re: ex parte Phillips</i> [1888] 5 Morrell's Bankruptcy Reports 40, where the bankruptcy notice was issued when an execution was in full force, and it was held by Cave J that when the bankruptcy notice was issued the creditor was not in a position to issue execution, in <i>Re: ex parte The Debtor</i> [1906] 1 KB 344, where the creditor accepted a bill for the amount of the debt, and where it was held by Cozens-Hardy MR that the creditor should not be allowed to present a bankruptcy, when he had, by taking the bill, agreed that he would suspend his rights, and where it was held by Fletcher - Moulton LJ that "when there are circumstances under which the court would, if applied to, prevent the issue of execution, those circumstances may bring the case within the interpretation which the court has put upon the words 'execution having been stayed' and that the creditor has to shew that you were in a position to receive payment at the date when you served the bankruptcy notice", and, in <i>Re: ex parte Greaves</i> [1913] 2 KB 300, where Phillimore J said that courts construed the words "execution thereon not having been stayed" to mean "a creditor who is in a position to issue execution".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Given the weight of the authorities, it must be that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, the creditor must be in a position to issue immediate execution. <i>Re A Kurumpian</i> [1918] 14 SSLR 144 which held to the contrary, simply could not stand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In our considered opinion, <i>Woodall</i> is the first and the foremost authority to follow on the meaning of the words "execution thereon not having been stayed", the meaning of which should be construed in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>, and not from the perspective of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">Section 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> should not be read to nullify <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the RHC</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">Section 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK> provides that "an action upon any judgment shall not be brought after the expiration of 12 years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable and no arrears of interest in respect of any judgment debt shall be recovered after the expiration of six years from the date on which the interest became due". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">Order 46 r 2(1)(a) of the RHC</LINK> is not incompatible with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>. What it all comes to is this: (1) "an action upon a judgment shall not be brought after the expiration of 12 years from the date that the judgment becomes enforceable", (2) "no arrears of interest in respect of any judgment debt shall be recovered after the expiration of six years from the date on which the interest became due", and, (3) "a writ of execution to enforce a judgment or order may not issue without the leave of court ... where six years or more have lapsed since the date of the judgment or order".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Whether a bankruptcy proceeding is an action upon a judgment is not an issue before us. But it would appear that the definitive word on it might still be unsaid (<i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> 3rd edn vol 24 at para 342 and <i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> 4th edn Reissue vol 28 at para 917 are silent on that point; in <i>National Westminster Bank plc v. Powney and Ors</i> [1990] 2 All ER 416, it was held that an application for leave to issue execution of a judgment was not an action upon a judgment; in <i>Re a Debtor</i> [1997] 2 All ER 789, it was held that a bankruptcy proceeding constituted an action on a judgment within s 24(1) of the English Limitation Act 1980 (which is <i>in pari materia</i> with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the LA 1953</LINK>); in <i>Lowsley and Another v.

ALTS Ltd</i> [2005] 2 All ER 304, it was held that insolvency proceedings, whether personal or corporate, did not fall within the scope of s 24(1) of English Limitation Act 1980, in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_3_673;"><i>Re Lim Szu Ang, Ex P Kewangan Utama Bhd</i> [2004] 3 MLRH 673</LINK>; [2005] 7 MLJ 487; [2005] 7 CLJ 23; [2006] 1 AMR 522, it was held that a bankruptcy proceeding is an action on a judgment; in <i>Re Man Po International Holdings Ltd</i> [2012] 5 HKC 539, it was held that the winding up petition that was based on a monetary judgment was a fresh action that was caught by s 4(4) of the HK Limitation Ordinance (Cap 347); in <i>Re Lau Wan</i> [2013] 6 HKC 64 and in <i>Re Li Man Hoo</i> [2013] 6 HKC 116, it was held that the bankruptcy petition was an action upon a judgment; in <i>Dennehy (a bankrupt) v.

But if a bankruptcy proceeding were an action upon a judgment, then it could not be brought after the expiration of 12 years from the date that the judgment becomes enforceable. If brought within 12 years, the creditor must then be in a position to issue immediate execution.</p>

      <b>[56]</b> We are ever mindful that <i>Tan Tem Son</i> is a recent decision of this court. But <i>Tan Tem Son</i> had clearly departed from history and case law. We see no alternative but to put it back to where it was, in line with other jurisdictions with a provision equipollent to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK>. For the Singapore position, see <i>AmBank (M) Bhd v. Yong Kim Yoong Raymond</i> [2009] 2 SLR 659, where it was held by the Court of Appeal per V K Rajah JA, now AG, delivering the judgment of the court, that "where the words 'execution therein not having been stayed' were used in s 3(1)(i) [of the Bankruptcy Act 1985] in contrast to the words 'which is enforceable by execution' in s 61(1)(d) of the present Act, the courts had always insisted that although the question of an execution of a judgment does not arise when a bankruptcy petition is presented, a judgment creditor who seeks to make the judgment debtor bankrupt on the basis of an unsatisfied judgment debt must have in his hands a final judgment that can be enforced forthwith or immediately". For the Australian position, see <i>Pepper v. McNiece</i> - BC4100016, where the High Court of Australia, Full Court, announced, "apparently the creditor who issues a bankruptcy notice must be in a position to issue execution on the judgment or order", <i>Re Pannowitz ex parte Wilson</i> [1975] 38 FLR 184, where it was held that "a judgment or order can found a bankruptcy notice only if 'execution' may be had upon it", <i>Re Coast Securities No 9 Pty Ltd</i> - BC8521012, where it held that the party seeking the issue of the bankruptcy notice must be in a position to issue execution immediately, and <i>Penning v. Steel Tube Supplies Pty Ltd</i> [1988] 80 ALR 689, where <i>Ide</i> was followed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> With respect, we could not subscribe to the reasoning in <i>Tan Tem Son</i>. Also, we could not agree that "any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment" in the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the Bankruptcy Act 1967</LINK> does not require a judgment creditor to obtain leave pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2(1)(a) of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> prior to initiating a bankruptcy proceeding based on a final judgment which has been obtained more than six years ago. Rather, we hold that any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment in the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_360;3.;;">s 3(1)(i) of the BA 1967</LINK> must be a person who is entitled to enforce a final judgment without prior leave of court. In the instant case, judgment was obtained on 10 October 2000. When the BN was issued on 3 January 2011, the judgment was more than six years old. In other words, when the BN was issued, the respondent was not in a position to execute the judgment without the leave of court. Leave should and could have been obtained (see <i>Ex parte Clements</i> [1901] 1 QB 260 at p 263). In that it was not, such that the respondent was then not in a position to execute the judgment, the respondent was not entitled to issue the BN.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> By reason of the aforesaid, our answer to the first leave question is in the positive, that is to say that a judgment creditor who commences bankruptcy proceedings after more than six years have lapsed from the date of the judgment, must obtain the prior leave of court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the RHC</LINK>, now replaced by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;46;SN2.;;">O 46 r 2 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. As our answer to the first leave question will dispose of this appeal, we do not see it necessary to answer the second leave question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> For these reasons, we unanimously allow these appeals with costs, both here and below, and set aside the said Bankruptcy Notices.</p>
