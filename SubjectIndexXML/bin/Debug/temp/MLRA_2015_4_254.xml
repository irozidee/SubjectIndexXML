    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant's property was sold to a successful bidder by way of a public auction pursuant to orders for sale obtained by the respondent as chargee under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 National Land Code ('NLC')</LINK>. A memorandum of sale was entered between the respondent and the successful bidder who paid 10 % of the purchase price with the balance to be settled within 120 days from the date of the sale of the property as stipulated by para 14 of the conditions of sale. The appellant subsequently filed a notice of application to revoke and set aside the memorandum of sale on the ground that the successful bidder failed to pay the balance purchase price within the 120 days from the date the property was sold on 30 March 2013. During the proceedings, the learned judge took judicial notice of a "Sijil Perakuan Penerimaan Harga Belian" ('the Certificate') dated 30 September 2013 filed by the respondent confirming that the successful bidder made the payment for the balance purchase price. Notwithstanding that the payment passed the 120-day deadline as per para 14 of the conditions of sale, the learned judge held that para 14 was merely an administrative requirement, the breach of which did not cause the contract of sale to lapse. The learned judge then dismissed the appellant's application. Hence, the appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;257.;;">Section 257 NLC</LINK> provided that every order for sale made by the court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 NLC</LINK> was required to be made in Form 16H. One of the terms that must be specified in the order for sale was that the balance of the purchase price must be settled not later than 120 days from the date of the sale. No extension of the period specified was allowed. Once the order for sale was made, the chargee was required to prepare the conditions of sale in accordance with the terms of the said order and any determination thereunder by the Registrar of the Court which was provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2) NLC</LINK>. The order for sale herein contained the term in question and the same was incorporated into the conditions of sale. (paras 9-10)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondent did not proffer any evidence on whether the successful bidder actually paid the full balance purchase price of the property. In the absence of such evidence, the successful bidder must be held to have failed to pay the full balance purchase price within the agreed period. The successful bidder therefore committed a breach of the agreement for the sale and purchase of the property. In the circumstances, the contract had lapsed and was therefore null and void. The respondent too did not make any attempt to rebut the appellant's contention that the successful bidder did not pay the full balance of the purchase price. Instead, the respondent resisted the application by insisting that the orders for sale and the public auction were valid. The notes of the proceedings and the respondent's written submission also showed that the respondent did not address the issue of the failure to pay the balance purchase price by the successful bidder. (paras 13-14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The only information on payment made by the successful bidder was by the respondent's counsel from the Bar during the hearing of the appellant's notice of application. There was no evidence given by the respondent under oath, which was not a proper way to reply to the appellant's positive assertion made on oath. It was not evidence within <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;3.;;">s 3 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1977_194;4.;;">ss 4</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1977_194;5.;;">5</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1977_194;6.;;">6 of the Oaths and Affirmations Act 1949</LINK>. The proper way to rebut the appellant's positive assertion under oath should appropriately be by way of an affidavit by the respondent or the successful bidder. Both had ample opportunity to do so but did not do it. Although the successful bidder was not a party to the present action, the notice of application was served on him. It followed that the respondent failed to contradict the appellant's positive assertion on a material issue and the respondent must be taken to have admitted the fact so asserted, the finding of which was sufficient to dispose of the instant appeal. (paras 15-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The learned judge erred in taking judicial notice of the "Sijil Perakuan Penerimaan Harga Belian" (the Certificate') filed subsequently by the respondent in breach of para 14 of the conditions of sale. By finding that the condition in para 14 was merely an administrative requirement, the breach of which was insignificant and did not cause the contract to lapse, the learned judge overlooked the purpose for which the said condition was provided. The manifest object and intent of that condition was to ensure that the sale of the property could be concluded with sufficient promptitude so that the chargee would recover the outstanding balance of the loan, the successful bidder would get the property that he had successfully bid and that the financial burden on the appellant of having to pay additional interest on the loan due to any inordinate delay could be lessened. Additionally, the fact that the date on the Certificate, ie 30 September 2013 was six and half months after the appellant filed the notice of application was questionable. Secondly, no one, not even the learned judge seemed to be aware of the fact of the existence of the Certificate when the proceedings in respect of the notice of application was in progress. If indeed the respondent filed the Certificate, there was no affidavit affirmed by the respondent confirming the payment, exhibiting the Certificate or explaining the delay in filing. The respondent should have submitted on that crucial issue in view of facing the prospect of the auction sale being declared null and void. If payment was made in full, the next course of action was for the officer of the court to issue a certificate of sale in Form 16F pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;259.;;">s 259(3) NLC</LINK> to the successful bidder. The learned judge however failed to address that there was no such certificate issued by the court. (paras 19-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The learned judge should not deviate from his scope of judicial functions and import into the case his own personal knowledge of particular facts. It would be more proper in all the circumstances of the case for the learned judge to leave it to the parties to handle their own case and determine the course of action they deemed appropriate to pursue. The learned judge should have informed the parties of, or confronted them with, the material discovery of the Certificate and allowed them to decide their next course of action. Justice and fair play should be uppermost in his mind for the parties, particularly the appellant, who should have at least been given the opportunity to address the court on the material circumstance that was so crucial to the appellant before the learned judge proceeded to make any decision. A denial of that opportunity would tantamount to depriving the appellant an equal opportunity to present her case on a level playing field. The learned judge too could not without giving evidence as a witness import into a case his own personal knowledge of particular facts so as to help out evidence for the respondent that would otherwise be inadequate to rebut the appellant's case. (paras 22 &amp; 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> While it might be true that para 14 of the conditions of sale was not based on any legal provision of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2) NLC</LINK> required the chargee to prepare the conditions of sale in accordance with the terms of the order for sale and any determination thereunder by the Registrar of the Court. Therefore, even though the conditions for sale were based on the Practice Directions of the Registrar of the High Court, the respondent was deemed to have made them pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2)</LINK>. The Practice Directions were intended to facilitate the imposition of the terms and conditions of sale and ensure consistency and uniformity of practice by the High Court throughout Peninsular Malaysia. But the conditions of sale derived their legal force from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2) NLC</LINK> and the order for sale made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">ss 256</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;257.;;">257 NLC</LINK>. Even if wrong in that regard, the conditions of sale and the orders for sale constituted the sale and purchase agreement. A breach of any of the conditions set out in the conditions of sale including the condition in para 14 would cause the contract secured by the respondent under the public auction to lapse and become null and void. (paras 30-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The court was not <i>functus officio</i> after it made the orders for sale in the foreclosure proceedings. The appellant did not seek to annul or set aside the orders for sale. The appellant sought to annul and set aside the memorandum of sale. The court had the power to do so and order for the property to be resold where circumstances necessitated as such. The contract that the successful bidder secured pursuant to the sale had lapsed and become null and void. Although the defaulting chargor abdicated her right as registered owner of the land, vis-a-vis selling it in favour of the chargee, an auction sale conducted fraudulently, collusively or improperly to the prejudice of the chargor or if the contract for the sale of the property lapsed due to a breach, entitled the chargor to intervene and set aside the sale. The appellant as the owner and chargor was still an interested party whose rights were affected or prejudiced by the breach of the contract where the resultant effect would be the liability on the appellant to pay additional interest on the loan. The appellant had the right to come to the court at this stage to have the sale annulled and set aside. (para 32)</p>

  <JUDGMENT>
    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Idrus Harun JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 3 February 2006, the appellant had entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the agreement) with the respondent for the purchase of a house at No 2, Tingkat Perpaduan 15, Taman Perpaduan, 31150 Ulu Kinta, Perak (the property). One of the terms of the agreement stipulates that the repayment of the housing loan shall be made by monthly instalments of RM400.00 every month until final settlement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In an action dated 7 July 2011 in which the respondent herein was the plaintiff, two orders were granted by the High Court on 21 November 2011 (the first order) and 29 August 2012 (the second order). The first order allowed the respondent to sell the property by way of a public auction under the direction of the court. The second order fixed the reserve price of the property for the purpose of the sale at RM110,000.00. The date specified in the second order for the public auction was 29 November 2012. Both orders (the Orders for Sale) were made as the appellant was alleged to have breached the charge that he had executed in respect of the property which breach, it was revealed, he had failed to remedy. The grounds of the breach were set out in the Notice Of Default With Respect To A Charge (the Notice) dated 31 March 2011 issued in Form 16D pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;254.;;">s 254 of the National Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The evidence gleaned from the Record of Appeal reveals that on or around September 2012, the respondent's representative informed the appellant that the property would be auctioned off on 29 November 2012. The appellant had made some payments, however he had failed to settle in full the outstanding balance of RM50,321.23 as stated in the Notice. The default resulted in due course in the respondent proceeding with the public auction on 29 November 2012. One Leow Yee Loong was the successful bidder at the public auction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At the fall of the auctioneer's hammer, both the successful bidder and the respondent entered into a Memorandum of Sale of the property in accordance with the condition in para 12 of the Conditions of Sale. The successful bidder paid 10% of the purchase price to the respondent with the balance thereof to be settled within the period of 120 days from the date of the sale of the property as stipulated under para 14 of the Conditions of Sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 15 March 2013, the appellant filed a Notice of Application seeking firstly a stay of the execution by the respondent and the bidder, of the Memorandum of Sale of the property dated 29 November 2012 until final disposal of the application, and secondly a revocation and setting aside of the said Memorandum of Sale. As the first prayer had already been dismissed by the court on 8 May 2013, the hearing before the learned judge was confined to the second prayer only. The learned Judge of the High Court dismissed the application on 26 March 2014. The appellant appeals against that judgment to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appeal is based on the contention which is confined exclusively to the status of the Memorandum of Sale which learned counsel on behalf of the appellant had submitted, without doubt correctly, that any failure on the part of the successful bidder to comply with the Conditions of Sale would cause the Memorandum of Sale to lapse and become null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Before we go more closely into the merits of this argument, it is perhaps appropriate to mention at this stage two material points. Firstly, this appeal is not concerned with the validity of the Orders for Sale and the public auction of the property. In fact learned counsel for the appellant had made this very clear in his submission on this issue. Secondly, what is apparent from the notes of evidence and the Notice of Application is that the appellant is not seeking to set aside the Orders for Sale. Instead the appellant is merely applying to set aside the Memorandum of Sale on the ground of non-compliance with the Conditions of Sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The forced sale of the property was made at the instance of the chargee namely the respondent pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the National Land Code</LINK>. In both his affidavits attested on 7 March 2013 and 22 July 2013, the appellant averred that the successful bidder failed to comply with the condition stipulated in para 14 of the Conditions of Sale which required payment of the balance of the purchase price to be made within the permitted time frame of 120 days from the date of the sale of the property the last date being 30 March 2013. The respondent, by way of an affidavit affirmed by its representative on 16 May 2013 denied the appellant's allegation and averred that the auction was in accordance with the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;257.;;">s 257 of the National Land Code</LINK>, every order for sale made by the court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256</LINK> thereof is required to be made in Form 16H. One of the terms which must be specified in the order for sale is that the balance of the purchase price shall be settled on a date not later than 120 days from the date of the sale and that no extension of the period so specified is allowed. Once such order has been made, the chargee is required to prepare the conditions of sale in accordance with the terms of the said order and any determination thereunder by the Registrar of the court. This is provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2) of the National Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The Order for Sale granted by the court on 21 November 2011 contains the term in question and the same has been incorporated into the Conditions of Sale in para 14. The Conditions of Sale in this regard, also provides in para 12 that a Memorandum of Sale must be signed by the successful bidder, the plaintiff or his solicitor and a court official who witnessed the auction on the same day the sale was made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is settled law that in a forced sale pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the National Land Code</LINK>, the chargee at whose instance the sale is effected is to be regarded as the vendor. The order for sale and the conditions of sale are to be regarded as the sale and purchase agreement [see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1989_3_568;"><i>Malayan United Finance Bhd, Johore Bahru v. Liew Yet Lan</i> [1989] 3 MLRH 568</LINK>; [1990] 1 MLJ 317 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_157;"><i>Mohamed Azmal Noor Naina Mohd Noor v. Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 157</LINK>; [2003] 4 MLJ 447; [2003] 2 CLJ 505; [2003] 3 AMR 265].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Having stated the law, there is not the slightest room for doubt that, in the case before us, the Orders for Sale, the Conditions of Sale and the Memorandum of Sale constitute a sale and purchase agreement. That being the case, in the event of any breach of the terms of the Conditions of Sale, the contract secured under the public auction would lapse and become null and void. In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_3_1;"><i>Wong Sze Soon v. Pegawai Pemegang Harta Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 3 MLRH 1</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 57; [1995] 4 CLJ 416, the plaintiff who was the successful bidder at a public auction pursuant to foreclosure proceedings, failed to pay the full balance of the purchase price within the time stipulated in the terms and conditions of the sale. The High Court held that without such payment, the contract secured by the plaintiff under the public auction lapsed and thus became null and void [see also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1997_4_828;"><i>Rajamanikam Adaikalam v. Bolton Finance Bhd</i> [1997] 4 MLRH 828</LINK>; [2000] 3 MLJ 454; [1999] 8 CLJ 491 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_6_830;"><i>Norazian Mohd Adnan v. Gale Force Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 6 MLRH 830</LINK>].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In the instant case, the appellant had alleged that the successful bidder did not pay the balance of the purchase price in respect of which he was obliged to do so within the stipulated period of 120 days and the respondent merely denied the said allegation. No evidence had been proffered by the respondent in its affidavit that the successful bidder had actually paid the full balance of the purchase price of the property. In the absence of any evidence to show that the successful bidder had paid the balance of the purchase price when due, we must accordingly hold that the successful bidder had failed to do so within the stipulated period stated in para 14 of the Conditions of Sale. The successful bidder had thus committed a breach of the agreement for the sale and purchase of the property. Under the circumstances the contract which the successful bidder had secured in respect of the sale of the property had lapsed and therefore become null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We pause to observe at this point that the respondent had never made any attempt to rebut the appellant's contention that the successful bidder had not paid the full balance of the purchase price, it had instead meekly resisted the application by insisting that the Orders for Sale and the public auction were valid. Further, we glean from the notes of the proceedings and the respondent's written submission that learned counsel for the respondent did not address the issue of the failure to pay the balance of the purchase price by the successful bidder. We think the respondent's explanation in its affidavit and the submission made on its behalf are wholly misconceived for the simple reason that at no time did the appellant question the validity of both the Orders for Sale and the public auction in respect of the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is important to note that the only information as regards the payment by the successful bidder was given by counsel from the Bar on behalf of the respondent during the hearing of the appellant's Notice of Application on 3 March 2014. There was no evidence under oath given by the respondent. In our judgment this is not a proper way to reply to the appellant's positive assertion made on oath. This is certainly not evidence within the meaning of that word in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;3.;;">s 3 of the Evidence Act 1950 (Act 56)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1977_194;4.;;">ss 4</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1977_194;5.;;">5</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1977_194;6.;;">6 of the Oaths and Affirmations Act 1949 (Act 194)</LINK>. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_48;"><i>Ng Hee Thoong &amp; Anor v. Public Bank Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 48</LINK>; [1995] 1 MLJ 281; [1995] 1 CLJ 609; [2000] 1 AMR 407, the Court of Appeal held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Likewise in the present case before us, the proper way to rebut the appellant's positive assertion under oath should appropriately be by way of an affidavit by the respondent or the successful bidder. Both the respondent and the successful bidder had ample opportunity to do so yet they, the respondent in particular, chose not to do it. In fact in this regard, we are mindful of the fact that the successful bidder is not a party to this action, however the Notice of Application was served on him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It is manifestly clear therefore that the respondent had failed to contradict the positive assertion upon the material issue made by the appellant. In law the respondent must be taken to have admitted the fact so asserted. Gopal Sri Ram JCA in <i>Ng Hee Thoong &amp; Anor v. Public Bank Berhad (supra)</i> said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> This finding should be sufficient to dispose of this appeal. Nevertheless, the next point raises a question which compels this court to consider this appeal further. The question concerns the finding of the learned judge in relation to the "Sijil Perakuan Penerimaan Harga Belian" (the Certificate) which His Lordship had come across upon perusal of the documents in the court's file. The Certificate according to the learned judge was filed by the respondent and confirmed that the respondent had received the whole payment of RM112,000.00 from the successful bidder on 27 March 2013 which was three days before the period of 120 days had expired.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned judge thereupon took judicial notice of the Certificate and admitted it in evidence. Based on the Certificate the learned judge made a finding that the successful bidder had paid the balance of the purchase price before the expiry of the period of 120 days in compliance with the condition set out in para 14 of the Conditions of Sale. The learned judge then proceeded to consider the condition in para 16 of the Conditions of Sale which required the respondent or its solicitor to submit to the court a Certificate in writing in respect of the payment of the balance of the purchase price together with a copy of the receipt of payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We assume, in the absence of any conclusive evidence, that this Certificate is the Certificate which the learned judge had found in the court's file even though His Lordship did not mention whether a copy of the receipt of payment was attached to it. After accepting that the Certificate was filed long after the period of seven days had expired which was, undoubtedly, in breach of para 16 of the Conditions of Sale, His Lordship ruled that the condition in the said paragraph was merely an administrative requirement without any statutory force as it was based on the Proclamation of Sale in Annexure 2, to the Practice Directions of the Registrar of the High Court No 1/2013 dated 29 January 2013. This, according to His Lordship, was contrary to the condition in para 14, which the learned judge rightly mentioned was a mandatory requirement with statutory force as it was based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;257.;;">s 257(1)(g) of the National Land Code</LINK>. This reasoning, assumes as we understand it, that since the condition in para 16 is merely an administrative requirement, the breach thereof is insignificant and would not cause the contract to lapse. But His Lordship, with the greatest respect, overlooked the purpose for which the said condition was provided. In our opinion, the manifest object and intent of this condition is to ensure that the sale of the property could be concluded with sufficient promptitude so that the chargee would recover the outstanding balance of the loan, the successful bidder would get the property that he had successfully bid and that the financial burden on the appellant of having to pay additional interest for the loan due to any inordinate delay could be lessened.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In the face of this revelation several pertinent questions have emerged. Firstly an important point to note is that the Certificate bears a date of 30 September 2013 which is six and half months after the appellant filed this Notice of Application. Secondly, no one, not even the learned judge seemed to be aware of the fact of the existence of the Certificate when the proceedings in respect of the Notice of Application were in progress. Next, if the respondent had filed the Certificate as the learned judge had stated, why the respondent did not affirm an affidavit confirming the payment, exhibiting the Certificate and explaining the delay. It would be somewhat perplexing for the respondent not to take this logical and correct step and submit on this crucial issue while facing the prospect of the sale of the property being declared null and void. If the payment had indeed been made in full, the next course of action to take under the law was for the officer of the Court to issue a Certificate of Sale in Form 16F pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;259.;;">s 259(3) of the National Land Code</LINK> to the successful bidder. However, His Lordship failed to address the issue whether there was any such Certificate issued by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In our judgment and with deference to the learned judge, His Lordship should not deviate from the judge's scope of judicial functions and import into the case his own personal knowledge of particular facts. It would be more proper in all the circumstances of this case for the learned judge in the general exercise of his judicial functions, to leave it to the parties to handle their own case and determine the course of action they deem appropriate to pursue. We think the learned judge should have informed the parties of, or confronted them with, the material discovery of the Certificate and allow them to decide what would be their next course of action to take such as taking those appropriate steps based on the questions we have raised in the preceding paragraph. Justice and fair play should be the uppermost in His Lordship's mind for in the context of this case, it dictates that the parties, in particular the appellant, should have at least been given the opportunity to address the court on the material circumstance that is so crucial to the appellant before the learned judge proceeded to make any decision on the appellant's application. A denial of this opportunity would, in our view tantamount to depriving the appellant an equal opportunity to present his case on a level playing field.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned judge as we have stated above, had on his own motion admitted the Certificate in evidence after taking judicial notice of its existence. For the appellant, it was submitted that the learned judge had erroneously admitted the Certificate in evidence as it only existed and in fact was filed on 30 September 2013. The respondent did not exhibit the Certificate in the affidavit that it had filed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In law, only facts which are admitted or of which the court will take judicial notice need not be proved. These two classes of facts are each found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;56.;;">ss 56</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;58.;;">58 of the Evidence Act 1950 (Act 56)</LINK>. The general rule is that all facts in issue and relevant facts must be proved by evidence [see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_426;"><i>Pembangunan Maha Murni Sdn Bhd v. Jururus Ladang Sdn Bhd</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 426</LINK>; [1986] 2 MLJ 30]. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;56.;;">Section 56 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> deals with facts that the court will take judicial notice while <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;57.;;">s 57</LINK> enumerates facts which the court shall take judicial notice. As regards <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;57.;;">s 57</LINK>, we are satisfied that the Certificate does not fall within any of the class of facts which the court shall take judicial notice. It is necessary therefore to consider whether the fact relating to the Certificate falls under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;56.;;">s 56 the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It is established law that matters for which the court may take judicial notice must be the subject of common and general knowledge and its existence is accepted by the public without qualification or contention. The test is whether sufficient notoriety attaches to the fact involved as to make it proper to assume its existence without proof [see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_583;"><i>Lee Chow Meng v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 583</LINK>; [1976] 1 MLJ 287]. This is done upon the request of the party seeking to rely on the fact in issue. Facts which are admitted under judicial notice are accepted without any necessity to be formally proved by a witness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned judge, in taking judicial notice of the existence of the Certificate relied on two cases. The first case is <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1950_1_537;"><i>Woo Chee Meng &amp; Ors v. The Collector Of Land Revenue Lower Perak</i> [1950] 1 MLRA 537</LINK>; [1950] 1 MLJ 262. In that case the court took judicial notice of the facts stated in the statement made by the Collector which he was required to state under s 23 of the Land Acquisition Enactment when making a reference to the High Court. <i>Woo Chee Meng</i>'s case in our opinion, can be distinguished from the present case as there the statement was referred to and argued by the parties in the course of the trial and it was made as a statutory requirement under s 23 of the Land Acquisition Enactment for the purpose of the land reference before the High Court. In the case before us, there was no evidence to show that the parties were aware of the existence of the Certificate and no arguments were made urging the court to take judicial notice of the same and admit it in evidence. Thus <i>Woo Che Meng</i>'s case is of little assistance to justify His Lordship's treatment of the Certificate by applying the doctrine of judicial notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The second case relied on by the learned judge was <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_565;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad v. Teobros Development Sdn Bhd</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 565</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 391. However, the learned judge of the High Court in that case quite clearly said that "what was indisputable, what was notorious and what was known to the community would attract the doctrine of judicial notice". While admittedly, His Lordship in the instant case did refer to the above passage, His Lordship, with due respect, obviously failed to appreciate and comprehend the significance of that statement which in fact had laid down the correct principle and test for the doctrine to apply. Reverting to the present appeal, the Certificate was only known to the learned judge. There was nothing notorious about the Certificate. The instant case, in our view does not pass this test. Accordingly we hold that the learned judge had erroneously admitted the Certificate in evidence when the doctrine of judicial notice clearly does not apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It is an elementary proposition of law, that cases must be decided on the evidence and that the evidence must be such as is relevant and admissible under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, that is, it must be either from admitted documents or the statement of witnesses or be something of which the court can take judicial notice. The learned judge cannot without giving evidence as a witness import into a case his own personal knowledge of particular facts so as to help out evidence for the respondent which would otherwise be inadequate to rebut the appellant case [<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_1_384;"><i>PP v. Sharma Kumari</i> [2000] 1 MLRH 384</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 254; [2000] 3 CLJ 596; [2000] 2 AMR 2359, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1953_1_534;"><i>Low Moh &amp; Anor v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1953] 1 MLRH 534</LINK>; [1954] 1 MLJ 14 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1953_1_608;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Lee Ee Teong</i> [1953] 1 MLRH 608</LINK>; [1953] MLJ 244].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The learned judge had, in connection with the condition in para 16 of the Conditions of Sale, decided that it had no statutory force adding that the condition in para 16 was based on the Practice Directions No 1/2013 dated 29 January 2013. In our opinion the applicable Practice Directions should be the Practice Directions Of The Registrar Of The High Court No 1/2011. This is because when the property was auctioned off on 29 November 2012 the said Practice Directions of No 1/2013 was non-existent. However, the condition in para 16 of Annexure C to the earlier Practice Directions is identical with para 16 of Annexure 2 to the Practice Directions No 1/2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We should say that while it may be true that para 16 of the Conditions of Sale is not based on any legal provision of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code</LINK>, it must be remembered that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2) of the National Land Code</LINK> requires the chargee to prepare the conditions of sale in accordance with the terms of the Order for Sale and any determination thereunder by the Registrar of the Court [see <i>Malayan United Finance Bhd, Johore Bahru v. Liew Yet Lan (supra)</i>]. Thus even though the conditions for sale are based on the Practice Directions of the Registrar of the High Court, in law it is made by the chargee pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2) of the National Land Code</LINK>. The Practice Directions are intended to facilitate the imposition of the term and conditions of sale and ensure consistency and uniformity of practice by the High Court throughout Peninsula Malaysia. But the Conditions of Sale derive its legal force from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;258.;;">s 258(2)</LINK> and the Order for Sale made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">ss 256</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;257.;;">257 of the National Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Even if we are wrong in this regard, the Conditions of Sale and the Orders for Sale, as we have stated earlier in our judgment, constitute the sale and purchase agreement. A breach of any of the conditions set out in the Conditions of Sale including the condition in para 16 would cause the contract secured by the respondent under the public auction to lapse and thus become null and void [see <i>Wong Sze Soon v. Pegawai Pemegang Harta Malaysia &amp; Anor (supra)</i> and <i>Rajamanikam Adaikalam v. Bolton Finance Bhd (supra)</i>].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> There remains the question whether the court was functus officio after it had made the Orders for Sale in foreclosure proceedings when the order had been drawn up and perfected. The court has no power to vary or set aside the order made. Accordingly the respondent's counsel argued, the court had no power to annul the auction unless the appellant fully satisfied the whole debt claimed. It would suffice for us to say, in answer to this argument, that the appellant is not seeking the annulment or setting aside of the Order for Sale. All that the appellant is asking is for the Memorandum of Sale to be annulled and set aside. In our judgment the court has power to annul and set aside the Memorandum of Sale and order for the land to be resold where circumstances necessitate the court to do so. In the instant appeal, we have already delved into the reasons leading to our finding that the contract which the successful bidder had secured pursuant to the sale had lapsed and become null and void. We are mindful of the fact that the defaulting chargor abdicates his right as registered owner of the land, <i>vis-a-vis</i> selling it, in favour of the chargee [<i>Malayan United Finance Bhd, Johore Bahru v. Liew Yet Lan (supra)</i>]. However, that is a far cry from saying that a chargor's right to the land vanishes as soon as the auctioneer brings down his hammer. This general proposition does not mean that if an auction sale has been conducted fraudulently, collusively or otherwise improperly to the prejudice of the chargor, or if we may add, if the contract for the sale of the property had lapsed due to a breach, he cannot intervene to set aside the sale whether or not the purchaser is privy to it [<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1990_2_706;"><i>Siland Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. M&amp;J Frozen Food Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1990] 2 MLRH 706</LINK>; [1990] 2 MLJ 502; [1990] 3 CLJ 94 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_2_334;"><i>Kuala Lumpur Finance Bhd v. Yap Poh Khian &amp; Ors</i> [1991] 2 MLRH 334</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 472; [1991] 3 CLJ 75]. Each party to the contract of sale had to perform his part of the obligation and until then, no executed or actual sale would have been concluded [see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_688;"><i>M&amp;J Frozen Food Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Siland Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 688</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 294; [1994] 2 CLJ 14; [1994] 1 AMR 137]. In our judgment until and unless the contract of sale has been concluded with the proprietary right conveyed from the vendor to the purchaser, the appellant being the owner and chargor is still an interested party whose rights may be affected or prejudiced due to certain event such as a breach of the contract as is in this case where the resultant effect would be the liability on the appellant to pay additional interest on his loan. He certainly has the right to come to the court at this stage to have the sale annulled and set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> On a critical examination of the whole of the evidence and for the reasons discussed, we accordingly at the conclusion of this appeal hold that the appellant is entitled to the reliefs sought. The Memorandum of Sale is revoked and set aside. The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. There is no order as to costs. The deposit shall be refunded to the appellant.</p>
