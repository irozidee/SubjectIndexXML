    <p>The plaintiffs in the High Court had alleged <i>inter alia</i> conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent misrepresentation and negligence against the defendants ("the 2010 Suit"). Just prior to the hearing of the 2010 Suit, the defendants introduced a new defence to the effect that pursuant to the terms of a consent order dated 29 September 2009, ("2009 Consent Order"), recorded in another civil suit ("the 2004 Suit"), the plaintiffs had compromised and/or settled all claims that the plaintiffs might have had in relation to the claims in the 2010 Suit and/or that all such claims had been satisfied and accordingly all the defendants had been released from any further liability and alternatively, pursuant to the terms of the 2009 Consent Order, the plaintiffs were estopped and/or precluded from pursuing the 2010 Suit. The defendants simultaneously filed separate applications to have certain questions of law or of construction of the 2009 Consent Order be determined before trial, and prayed that should the answers to those questions be in the affirmative, the plaintiffs' 2010 Suit was to stand dismissed. The High Court allowed the applications and dismissed the plaintiffs' action. The plaintiffs thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the plaintiffs' appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Where parties apply to resolve a matter by an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A Rules of Court 2012 ("ROC")</LINK> process, it was for the court to rule whether the question posed was one that was suitable for determination without a full trial of the action in the particular circumstances involved and also whether there was a need for oral evidence to be adduced for a just outcome of the matters in controversy. Any such determination by the court could have the effect of totally disposing the cause or matter, a very drastic outcome that should be uppermost in the mind of the court when dealing with such an application. (paras 31-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> A consent order was by nature similar to a contract between the parties to the suit or binding in respect of matters adumbrated in such a consent order. The usual rules for construing a commercial contract would accordingly be relevant in the construction of a consent order. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The particular issues that fell for determination by the High Court could not be answered by a mere <i>ex facie</i> reading of the 2009 Consent Order and its terms. The divergent positions canvassed to be given to the terms of the 2009 Consent Order, had to be tested against direct evidence of the parties who negotiated the terms of the 2009 Consent Order. (para 44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> While the court was required to objectively assess the intention of the parties from the language employed in the 2009 Consent Order and perhaps evidence would not be admissible to vary or contradict the terms contained in the 2009 Consent Order, it was established that extrinsic evidence could be accepted by the court to determine the factual context and the parameters of the exact dispute that formed the background to the recording of the 2009 Consent Order. This would include evidence as to the 'genesis' and, objectively, the 'aim' of the transaction concerned. (para 46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The court had to first and foremost, in the particular circumstances surrounding the 2009 Consent Order, identify what had been agreed to be settled. This could only be achieved after considering such further evidence as may be led before the court, before proceeding to conclude on an 'objective basis' whether the ambit of any 'release' was as contended for by the defendants. In the light of conflicting submissions, this could not and ought not to have been determined summarily. The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A ROC</LINK> process was therefore not suitable or appropriate in the circumstances. (para 48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The issues that arose from the affidavits/submissions of the parties when the defendants' respective applications were dealt with by the court, were therefore not purely questions of law. They involved questions of mixed fact and law. The four questions posed to or considered by the judge could not be summarily determined or disposed, as was done here, leading to the plaintiffs' suit being dismissed. (para 49)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In this judgment, the parties will be referred to as they were at the High Court in Suit: D-22NCVC-2317-2010 (the 2010 Suit).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> There were seven appeals before us. They were all by the plaintiffs against the decisions of the High Court of 12 June 2013 which upon the separate applications of the defendants had ordered that the plaintiffs' action be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The defendants' applications were brought pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> and/ or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order33.;;">O 33 of the Rules of Court 2012 (ROC 2012)</LINK> (although in the respective Notis Permohonan filed by 5th &amp; 6th defendants, 7th defendant, 10 &amp; 11th defendants and the 13th &amp; 14th defendants, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19(1) of ROC 2012</LINK> was also referred to).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> A perusal of paras 12 to 17 of the re-amended statement of claim showed that the plaintiffs' cause of action was grounded on allegations of 'conspiracy' (carried out in two stages it is stated), breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent misrepresentation or trading, in the tort of negligence and/or for being party to or assisting in such wrongful acts. The net result of the aforesaid, it was claimed, was to injure and cause loss to the plaintiffs by deprivation of their assets, more specifically by vesting the ownership of 'MBf Taylors Shares' and 'Taylors Land' in others to the exclusion and to the detriment of the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Basically there were three categories of persons who were being sued by the plaintiffs in the 2010 Suit:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The 'MBf Taylors Shares' referred above were the shares in the 5th defendant. The 6th defendant was a wholly owned subsidiary of the 5th defendant and currently running the institution known as 'Taylors College'.</p>
    <p>The 'Taylors Land' was registered in the name of the 6th defendant. The 'MBf Taylors Shares' had been or were being now held by the 7th defendant and/or the 13th and 14th defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The plaintiffs in this action sought for, <i>inter alia</i>, the following relief:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The trial of the 2010 Suit was fixed to commence on 14 January 2013. Just prior to that date the defendants applied for and obtained leave to further amend their respective re-re-amended statements of defence. A new defence somewhat in uniform terms was introduced by the defendants against the plaintiffs' action, namely that by virtue of the terms of a Consent Order of Court dated 29 September 2009 (2009 Consent Order) recorded in another suit, Civil Suit No: D3-22-1497-2004 (the 2004 Suit) (and a Solicitor's letter of 30 September 2009) the plaintiffs had compromised and/or settled all claims that the plaintiffs might have had in relation to the claims in the 2010 suit and/ or that all such claims had been satisfied and accordingly all the defendants had been released from any further liability; alternatively, by the terms of the 2009 Consent Order, the plaintiffs were estopped and/or precluded from pursuing with the 2010 Suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The defendants simultaneously with the application to amend their defences filed separate applications to have certain questions of law or of construction of a document (that is, the 2009 Consent Order) be determined before trial, and should the answers to those questions be in the affirmative, it was further prayed that the plaintiffs' suit was to stand dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> There were four questions that were eventually considered by the learned judge as would appear from the grounds of decision, and they were the following: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The 2009 Consent Order And Salient Background Of The 2004 Suit</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The 2009 Consent Order and the Solicitor's Letter of 30 September 2009 are reproduced below for ease of reference:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The 1st plaintiff was part of the MBf Group of Companies controlled by one Tan Sri Loy (since deceased) who was the father of the 1st defendant. The 2nd plaintiff was a wholly owned subsidiary of the 1st plaintiff. The 1st defendant was at some point of time the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the 1st plaintiff and also of another company in the same group, known then as MBf Capital Berhad.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Pursuant to a restructuring exercise, another related company in the Group, MBf Corporation Bhd, took over the listing status of MBf Capital Berhad and the 1st defendant was appointed to the Board of MBf Corporation Berhad on 2 July 2003.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> There were certain arrangement entered into between the 1st defendant and one Tan Sri Ninian Mogan Lourdenadin (Tan Sri Mogan) in or about 2002 which eventually saw Tan Sri Mogan taking over the controlling interest in the 1st plaintiff and the 1st defendant in turn reducing his personal stake in 1st plaintiff. On 16 January 2004 the 1st defendant resigned from the Boards of the 1st plaintiff and subsidiaries of the 1st plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> There had been in existence various intercompany loans between the companies in the MBf Group. Such intercompany loans included a series of loans from one MBf Leasing Sdn Bhd (MBf Leasing) to the 1st plaintiff. MBf Leasing was a subsidiary of MBf Corporation Berhad, subsequently controlled by the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> There however arose differences as between the 1st defendant and Tan Sri Mogan in the exercise of hiving off the various entities within the original MBf Group into their respective stables, namely under MBf Corporation Berhad in the case of the 1st defendant, and the 1st plaintiff in the case of Tan Sri Mogan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> MBf Leasing (now under MBf Corporation Berhad) issued a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;218.;;">s 218-Notice (Companies Act 1965)</LINK> on the 1st plaintiff, and four other subsidiaries of the 1st plaintiff, threatening to wind-up those companies, unless certain of the outstanding inter-company loans were settled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The 2004 Suit was filed by the 1st plaintiff, and the four subsidiaries of the 1st plaintiff named there, to restrain MBf Leasing from proceeding with the threatened winding-up of those entities. At the same time, MBf Leasing had also commenced certain other actions to similarly recover inter-company loans (the Recovery Actions), some of which also cited the 1st plaintiff as a defendant as well in those proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On 29 September 2009, the High Court Judge who was to hear the 2004 Suit and the Recovery Actions persuaded the parties to resolve those cases and accordingly after negotiations, the 2009 Consent Order was entered in court. The terms of the 2009 Consent Order was further clarified by the contents of the Solicitor of Letter of 30 September 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Summary Of The Submission Before Us</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The thrust of the arguments of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants was that the terms of the Consent Order reflected an all encompassing final settlement that had been reached as between the two groups of interests that had evolved out of the original MBf Groups of Companies, namely, one group controlled by the 1st defendant (Dato' Loy Group) and the other controlled by Tan Sri Mogan (Tan Sri Mogan Group).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Emphasis was placed on Item 3 of the 2009 Consent Order which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It was also pointed out that in this alleged settlement reached, the 1st plaintiff (the 1st plaintiff in 2004 Suit too) had to only pay RM7.5 million as a compromised sum against a total claim of some RM100 million that apparently the companies Dato' Loy Group had against the 1st plaintiff and its subsidiary companies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In so far as the other defendants were concerned, namely, those who were nominees or were subsequently holders or ultimately vested with the MBf Taylor Shares or the Taylors Land, it was submitted that since the settlement reached vide the 2009 Consent Order amounted to a complete release and discharge of whatever liability between the groups, any liability attached onto them as joint, or as concurrent or even as several tortfeasors or as alleged parties to the alleged conspiracy, had been similarly compromised and settled.</p>
    <p>For the professional advisers in turn, it was contended that they too were absolved of any liability whatsoever arising since what was being sought to be recovered against them in this 2010 Suit constituted the 'same loss' that had been discharged by the plaintiffs in the light of the terms of the 2009 Consent Order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The plaintiffs on the other hand contended that the cause of action relied upon and the relief sought in this 2010 Suit was totally different from that which formed the subject of the 2004 Suit and/or the Recovery Actions. Further, none of the defendants cited here in this 2010 Suit were any of the named defendants or parties in the 2004 Suit and any of the Recovery Actions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It was urged upon us that this 2010 Suit was in substance a classic case of a corporate entity seeking to recover its 'crown-jewel'/assets taken out of its possession by wrongful and fraudulent acts of its own former officers and agents of such officers. Hence the basis or causes(s) of the action upon which the 2010 Suit was premised was distinct and separate from that in the 2004 Suit or the Recovery Actions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Focussing then on Item 3 of the 2009 Consent Order, particularly the specific words therein used - "... including all claims against officer bearers of the said groups of companies.", it was argued that in this 2010 Suit, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants were not being sued as officers of the Dato' Loy Group (of companies) but in their individual capacities as former officers of the 1st plaintiff and/or 2nd plaintiff for breach of their fiduciary obligations and statutory responsibilities owed to the 1st and/or 2nd plaintiff; the other defendants had assisted in or were otherwise agents or parties to the alleged wrongdoings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In any event, it was pointed out that by law, the ambit of any documented 'release' relied upon had still to be construed within reasonable bounds (per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <i>BCCI v. Ali &amp; Ors</i> [2002] 1 AC 251 at p 268) and an ordinary and natural reading of the 2009 Consent Order, particularly Item 3 thereof, did not in this case, carry the wide purport or reach as argued for by the defendants. The written terms of the 2009 Consent Order had to be objectively determined by the court, but this did not however preclude the court, it was submitted, from considering the particular context of the 2004 Suit/Recovery Actions, and more significantly, the actual negotiations or matters forming the background to and leading up to the terms of the 2009 Consent Order being drawn up as they were here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It was the plaintiffs' position that the primary cause of action raised in the 2010 Suit ( conspiracy to deprive the 1st plaintiff of their right and interest in MBf Taylors Shares and Taylors Land) was in any case never within the contemplation of the parties in this 2010 Suit at the time the 2009 Consent Order was entered into.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In the light of obvious disputes as to the surrounding facts leading to and the conflicting arguments as to the meaning to be accorded to the terms of the 2009 Consent Order (particularly the scope of Item 3 there), it was counsel for the plaintiffs' submission that the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A ROC 2012</LINK> process was not a suitable one to summarily dispose off the plaintiffs' action without calling for oral evidence; the learned judge, it was urged upon us, had therefore erred in allowing the respective applications of the defendants and dismissing the 2010 Suit outright.</p>

      <b>Our Observations And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">Order 14A ROC 2012</LINK> proceedings.</p>
    <p>There was no doubt about the scope and efficacy of using <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A ROC 2012</LINK> procedure where a core legal issue or the construction of the terms of a written document could be determinative of the whole or substantial issues in the case. It was on the other hand also clear on decided authorities that such a process was not appropriate where there arose conflicting allegations of facts or where disputes as to facts were interwoven with legal issues. Similarly, the determination of the question or the construction of a document was not suitable by this procedure where it was being invoked based on assumed facts.</p>
    <p>In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_744;"><i>Low Chee &amp; Sons Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Extreme System Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 744</LINK>; [2013] 1 MLJ 650; [2012] 2 AMR 704, the Court of Appeal had recently once again reaffirmed the principle that for an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> process to be availed of, all material facts must be admitted and the court should not be called to give a ruling <i>in vacuo</i> or based on hypothetical facts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Where parties apply to resolve the matter by an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A ROC 2012</LINK> process, it was still for the court when deliberating through the affidavits/submissions before it, to rule whether the question posed was one that was suitable for determination without a full trial of the action in the particular circumstances involved and also whether there was a need for oral evidence to be adduced for a just outcome of the matters in controversy. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_1;"><i>Bato Bagi &amp; Ors v. Kerajaan Negeri Sarawak &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 297; [2011] 8 CLJ 766; [2011] 5 AMR 493).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Another significant aspect involved in an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A ROC 2012</LINK> process that had to be given particular attention to was the fact that any such determination by the court could have the effect of totally disposing the cause or matter. This was a very drastic outcome at that, and should be in the uppermost mind of the court when dealing with such an application. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A;SN1.;;">Order 14A r 1(1)</LINK>, it will be noted stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(See also the Court of Appeal in <i>Low Chee &amp; Sons</i>' case, <i>supra</i>)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We accept that it is settled law that a consent order was by nature similar to a contract between the parties to the suit or binding in respect of matters adumbrated in such a consent order. The usual rules for construing a commercial contract would accordingly be relevant in the construction of the consent order. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2008_8_604;"><i>Malaysia Discounts Bhd &amp; Ors v. Pesaka Astana (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2008] 8 MLRH 604</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 839).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Counsel for the plaintiffs apart from highlighting that, firstly, none of the defendants here in the 2010 Suit were parties in 2004 Suit or were referred directly in 2009 Consent Order, and secondly, that the basis of complaint in the 2010 Suit against the defendants here was distinct in itself, also identified two principal areas of controversy that arose in the light of the affidavits filed and the submissions of the respective parties <i>vis-a-vis</i> the defendants' application. Both centred on Item 3 of the 2009 Consent Order, and how it should be construed. We were in agreement that it boiled down to the following issues, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> As noted earlier, the test of whether the question of law or of construction of a document was 'suitable' to be determined under an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A ROC 2012</LINK> process required careful consideration of whether all the necessary and material facts relating to the subject matter of the question (here surrounding the Consent Order) had been duly proved or, alternatively, admitted. This therefore presupposed that there was no dispute or any further dispute as to the surrounding facts at the time the court proceeded to make the determination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In that respect, it should be noted here, that in this instant situation, there was no 'statement of agreed facts' settled as between the parties. The court, in our considered view, was being asked to assume or accept as a given 'fact', matters which allegedly constituted the agreed reach or scope of the 2009 Consent Order in terms of the parties implicated or even in terms of the matters meant to be encompassed within the terms of the 2009 Consent Order and the release or discharge stated to be incorporated thereunder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> At the expense of repetition, It needs to be particularly highlighted that all the defendants named in the 2010 Suit were strangers to the 2004 Suit or the said Recovery Actions. The defendants were attempting to extend the so called release or discharge of liability as per the terms of the 2009 Consent Order to themselves as well, although they were not directly named or included there and this too, in respect further of a cause of action patently different from which was the subject of the 2004 Suit or the Recovery Actions, and the settlement specifically stated at Item 2 of the 2009 Consent Order itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Although the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants in this 2010 suit l (the alleged conspirators) were office bearers in MBf Leasing or Dato' Loy Group of companies, this action was clearly not being brought against them in that capacity/those capacities. They were being sued in this 2010 Suit for their actions or omissions as former officers of the 1st plaintiff.</p>
    <p>We found merit in this important distinction drawn by learned counsel for appellant, Mr Tommy Thomas. The words "... <i>vice versa</i> including all claims against office bearers of the said group of companies" at Item 3 of the 2009 Consent Order was definitely open to an interpretation that it only extended to the respective officers/Directors of the two groups of companies (Mogan Group and Dato' Loy Group) if there were cross-claims that might exist as between those entities within the respective groups.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The pertinent question that arose then was-whether whatever settlement and discharge reached had a wide sweeping effect to extinguish cause(s) of action then existing (or which were discovered subsequently) arising from acts, omission or breaches of fiduciary duties committed by individual Director/ officers of 1st and/or 2nd plaintiffs during the tenure of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd defendants as Directors or officers of the plaintiffs, as was the subject of this case?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The other question that could not be readily answered purely by a literal or ordinary reading of Item 3 of the 2009 Consent Order was as to when in point of time the cause of action in the 2010 Suit arose (alleged here in conspiracy, breach of fiduciary obligations). In other words, when did the Tan Sri Mogan group, represented by the 1st plaintiff, become aware that it had a legal recourse in the matter to commence proceedings to nullify the impugned transactions involving MBf Taylors Shares and Taylors Land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> There were divergent submissions on this issue as well. The defendants pointed out that the 1st plaintiff (Tan Sri Mogan group) had in 2007 itself obtained legal advice as to their legal recourses in respect of the transactions now being challenged (as confirmed in a Board Minutes of 21 August 2007) but had not expressly excluded/reserved such right to bring separate or subsequent proceedings against Dato' Loy Group (or some of them within the group) in the 2009 Consent Order entered into at a later point in time. It was argued that this meant that the 1st plaintiff (or Tan Sri Mogan Group) had 'abandoned' any such related rights.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In our view the converse could also have been true. The absence of any such express reservation of the right to bring an action on the impugned transactions, could also well mean that it was not intended to be abandoned at all by the 1st plaintiff. In short the answer in any event, did not patently lie within the terms of Item 3 of the 2009 Consent Order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The issue of whether all prior claims which the 1st plaintiff may have had on or before 16 January 2004 against the defendants or those affiliated to the Dato' Loy Group had been intended to, if not agreed, to be waived or not, could not be determined merely by examining the wording of Item 3 of the 2009 Consent Order, notwithstanding the use of the phrase- "... of all claims up to the cut-off date of 16 January 2004" there. What had to be considered also was the factual matrix or background against which the 2009 Consent Order was entered into after negotiations between the parties, which indisputably was essentially in the nature of a compromise only of the 2004 Suit, the Recovery Actions and certain interpleader proceedings all identified specifically in the 2009 Consent Order itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The particular issues that fell for determination by the High Court as identified above, therefore could not be answered by a mere <i>ex facie</i> reading of the Consent Order and its terms. The divergent positions canvassed to be given to the terms of the 2009 Consent Order, in our view, had to be tested against direct evidence of the parties who negotiated the terms of the 2009 Consent Order, including the principal players in that episode in court, namely Dato' Loy Teik Ngan, Tan Sri Mogan and possibly their legal and other advisers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_1;"><i>Berjaya Times Square Sdn Bhd v. M-Concept Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 597; [2010] 1 CLJ 269; [2010] 2 AMR 205 had this to say with respect to the court being entitled to look at the factual matrix or background of the transaction involved in construing a contract (at pp 17-18):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> While the court was required to objectively assess the intention of the parties from the language employed in the 2009 Consent Order and perhaps evidence would not be admissible to vary or contradict the terms contained in the 2009 Consent Order (as a written contract <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;91.;;">ss 91</LINK>-<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;92.;;">92 Evidence Act 1950</LINK>), it was established that extrinsic evidence could be accepted by the court to determine the factual context and the parameters of the exact dispute that formed the background to the recording of the 2009 Consent Order. This would include evidence as to the 'genesis' and, objectively, the 'aim' of the transaction concerned (here the entering of the 2009 Consent Order). (See <i>Prenn v. Simmonds</i> [1971] 3 All ER 237, per L Wilberforce at p 241).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> As also noted by Gibbs J in the case of <i>Australian Broadcasting Commission v. Australasian Performing Rights Association Ltd</i> [1973] 129 CLR 99:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The court had to first and foremost, in our considered opinion, in the particular circumstances surrounding the 2009 Consent Order, identify what had been agreed to be settled. This could only be achieved after considering such further evidence as maybe led before the court, before proceeding to conclude on an 'objective basis' whether the ambit of any 'release' was as contended for by the defendants; in the light of conflicting submissions, this could not and ought not to have been determined summarily. The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A ROC 2012</LINK> process was therefore not suitable or appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> It need also be stressed that the issues that have presented itself on the affidavits/submissions of the parties when the defendants' respective applications were dealt with by the court, were therefore not purely questions of law. It involved questions of mixed fact and law. With respect the learned judge had misdirected herself to this scenario and its implications. The four questions posed to or considered by the learned judge could not be summarily determined or disposed, as it was done here, leading to the plaintiffs' suit being dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Whatever legal consequences flowing from such alleged 'discharge' (whether it was a release or a waiver or a covenant not to sue) or that the other defendants excluding the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants, were equally discharged as joint or concurrent or several tortfeasors, was another matter altogether. This was to be determined only after the language employed in the 2009 Consent Order was first objectively interpreted and ruled upon, in the context of the background in which the 2009 Consent Order was entered into.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> We were therefore of the unanimous view that all the appeals ought to be allowed and the respective orders of the High Court dismissing the plaintiffs' suit (including the award of costs to the defendants) be set aside. We further ordered that the plaintiffs' suit be remitted to the High Court for case management and full trial.</p>
