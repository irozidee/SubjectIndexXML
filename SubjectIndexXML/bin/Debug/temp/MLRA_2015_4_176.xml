    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiffs/respondents suffered loss and damage as a result of a fire at the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's warehouse. The respondents contended that the fire originated from the defendant's/appellant's container, parked on land adjoining the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's warehouse, which contained highly flammable nitrocellulose. The respondents thus sued the appellant for damages in the High Court. The appellant however submitted that the fire originated from the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's warehouse which then spread to the appellant's container on the adjoining land. At the trial, the High Court accepted the evidence of PW8 who had prepared a detailed report. The report concluded that the fire originated from nitrocellulose remains in the appellant's container and then spread to the warehouse. The report determined that it was unlikely for the fire to have started from the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's warehouse and ruled out other potential causes of the fire at the warehouse. The High Court held that there was sufficient credible and cogent evidence that the fire originated from the appellant's container parked in the adjoining premises and was caused by highly inflammable nitrocellulose that was present in significant amounts, which had self-ignited and caused the fire. The High Court thus allowed the respondents' claims. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was little, if any, in the way of a finding of fact made by the High Court for itself. PW8's findings and conclusions were matters of opinion. However, the High Court failed to address the preliminary question of the experience and expertise of PW8 such as to warrant giving her opinion any weight as an expert witness in a court of law. Acceptance of the opinion or conclusion of a witness is a critical error, the only exception being a specific finding as to the experience and expertise of that witness to give that opinion or draw that conclusion - in the instant case as to spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose and the conditions causing spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose. (paras 7-8)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The issue was whether the respondents had proved upon a balance of probabilities that the fire started from the appellant's container. It was not necessary for the appellant to establish that the fire started from the respondent's warehouse. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The reasoning in the report was somewhat incomplete in its consideration of the various possibilities that it was unsafe to be accepted as the basis to hold that, on a balance of probabilities, the fire that caused the damage to the respondents' warehouse started from the spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose in the container in the appellant's yard. This was consistent with the reports of the fire department and the testimonies of PW6 and DW6 that the cause of the fire was unknown. (paras 21-22)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/defendant, Timur Permai Holdings Sdn Bhd ("the appellant") appealed against the decision allowing the claim by the respondents/plaintiffs, Jasa Kita Warehousing Service Sdn Bhd, Klang Hock Polystyrene Industries Sdn Bhd and NKR Continental (M) Sdn Bhd ("the respondents") in respect of losses arising from the damage to the goods and warehouse of the respondents caused by fire on 7 November 2005. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent rented the land and the five warehouses thereon from the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. The 3<sup>rd</sup> respondent was a client of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent and had stored his goods in the warehouses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The case for the respondents was that the fire originated from the appellant's container which contained highly flammable nitrocellulose, had spread to the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's warehouse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The case for the appellant was that the fire originated from the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's warehouse which then spread to the appellant's container parked on land adjoining the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The issue, as correctly identified by the High Court, was where the fire originated from. More precisely, the issue was did the fire originate from the appellant's container.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In considering the balance of probabilities, the High Court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings And Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The primary basis of the findings of the High Court was not the report and testimony of PW8 as to what she observed at the scene after the fire, but also PW8's conclusions or findings of fact that the fire originated from the appellant's container, that the nitrocellulose spontaneously ignited and there was "physical evidence of a second explosion". When asked if she could tell the court where the fire originated from, PW8, a witness called by the respondents said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> There was otherwise little, if any, in the way of a finding of fact made by the High Court for itself. While PW8's testimony as a witness as to what she saw at the scene is entirely reliable and may be accepted, PW8's findings and conclusions are matters of opinion. Where the fire originated from was the issue of fact before the High Court. In accepting the testimony and report of PW8, the High Court accepted PW8's assessment of other witnesses at the scene, namely Encik Mohammad, Encik Fauzi, Encik Yubaraj and Mr Leong (see QA39):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The High Court failed to address the preliminary question of the experience and expertise of PW8 such as to warrant giving her opinion any weight as an expert witness in a court of law. Acceptance of the opinion or conclusion of a witness is a critical error, the only exception being a specific finding as to the experience and expertise of that witness to give that opinion or draw that conclusion, in this case as to spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose and the conditions causing spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose in this case. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_137;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Muhamad Sulaiman</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 137</LINK>; [1982] 2 MLJ 320; [1982] CLJ 292). The necessity to refute opinions of PW8 did not arise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The witness statement of Encik Mohamad Bin Yaacob (PW1) shows PW1 to be the better witness, being the person who discovered the fire, sought help and tried to fight the fire. The High Court inexplicably not only failed to address the evidence of PW1, but also failed to explain why the testimony of PW1 was rejected as it appeared to be. Nor did the counsel for the respondents before us referred to the testimony of PW1 to support a finding that the fire originated from the appellant's side.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> According to PW1, the first timr he knew of the fire was when he went to investigate the sound of a loud explosion (QA22). It was evident there was a big fire after the explosion. But the key issue before the court was what caused the explosion. On the face of it, it could have been a small fire on the appellant's side that caused it, or for that matter a small fire from the respondents' side spreading to the appellant's container. If indeed the nitrocellulose in the container was the source of spontaneous combustion, the container would have exploded and then if there was ensuing fire, the fire spread out to other parts, including the respondents' building. But in its grounds of decision, the High Court spoke of a "second explosion". In other words, the explosion was caused by the fire.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We sought guidance from the submissions for the respondents made before us. The origin and source of the fire was dealt with, commencing para 12 of the written submissions. The argument was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> As we have said earlier above, the issue more precisely put was whether the respondents had proved upon a balance of probabilities that the fire started from the appellant's container. It was not necessary for the appellant as defendant to establish the fire started from the respondent's warehouse. It was not for the appellant to be aggrieved with PW2 and PW3 if their reports did not list the cause of the fire that damaged the respondents' warehouse and goods. Where a fire truck arrived first, or who lodged a report did not determine the location of where the fire started. Nor did labelling a witness partisan or unreliable provides any contribution to discovering the truth. The arguments as to DW5 were irrelevant. We have addressed the evidence of PW8 earlier above. We observed that it emerged from the submissions for the respondents that the "second explosion" was in fact an earlier explosion involving the same container.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We examined the Forensic Report by PW8 at Rekod Rayuan Bah C (Jilid 1) pp 736-886. It was clearly marked "Private and Confidential For the Purposes of Litigation". The report was made at the behest of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> That part of the report that pertained to the container began at p 754. At s 4.4, PW8 dealt with the subject of origin of the fire and its spread. It began as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The reasoning for the conclusion was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The PW8's report proceeded to address the probabilities of "Container v. Warehouse Fire". It considered how a fire originating at the container could have spread into the warehouse and caused the damage in the warehouse, that an explosion and the venting of hot gases through gaps in the hoarding towards the wall of the warehouse would ignite the goods, especially the corrugated cardboard and polystyrene packaging inside the warehouse which would have been stacked close to the wall.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We observed that it involved a number of assumptions, of not mere explosion but a fire burning hot enough outside the warehouse wall to cause cardboard and polystyrene inside the warehouse to ignite and burn. Although there was a ruptured ethylene oxide gas cylinder projected into the appellant's yard from the warehouse, and evidence of other ruptured cylinders in the warehouse, PW8 accepted the indication of Mr Leong Kee Leong, the Operations Manager of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent that the cylinders were empty:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We observed that the reasoning applied was that the material in the appellant's container was dangerous, with a history of catching fire and exploding, ergo the cause of fire could not have been the ethylene oxide gas cylinders despite that ethylene oxide gas is flammable gas used in welding operations, and a ruptured cylinder had been thrown out from the warehouse into the appellant's yard. In other words, from the mute evidence observed after the fire, it remained not possible to say from where or how the fire started. The container was the subject of two explosions. The state of the container after the first explosion was not compared to the state after the explosion on 7 November 2005. It was simply accepted that there was a spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose causing the explosion on 7 November 2005 and the ensuing fire, when a fire outside the container could also cause temperatures to rise in the container to the auto-combustion temperature of 140 degrees Celsius of nitrocellulose, and then causing the ejection of hot air through the gap in the hoarding and to the walls of the warehouse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The statement was made at p 26 of the report that after the earlier explosion:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It would seem, from inspection of the photographs of the container after the earlier explosion, that the statement there was considerable amount of nitrocellulose, unburnt, still remaining, was an overstatement. Further it was not shown how, from an explosion of spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose in the container, there could be fire hot enough and sustained long enough from the container to cause cardboard and polystyrene on the inside of the warehouse to catch fire.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In short, we found the reasoning in the report somewhat incomplete in its consideration of the various possibilities that it was unsafe to be accepted as the basis of a decision to hold that it proved upon a balance of probabilities that the fire that caused the damage to the respondents' warehouse started from spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose in the container in the appellant's yard.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> This conclusion was consistent with the reports of the fire department (see the 16 November 2005 Report and the 7 December 2005 Reports) and the testimonies of PW6 Mohd Puzi bin Mohd Tabot and DW6 Jamaluddin bin Ismail that the cause of the fire was unknown. They were far more disinterested witnesses than PW8 and their reports must be given due weight (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_1_626;"><i>Yung Kong Co Bhd v. HHH Tyre Retreading Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Case</i> [2009] 1 MLRH 626</LINK>; [2009] 4 CLJ 424.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Accordingly, we allowed the appeal with costs in the sum of RM20,000.00, set aside the order of the High Court and ordered that the deposit be refunded.</p>
