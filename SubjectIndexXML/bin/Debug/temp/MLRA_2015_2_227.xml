    <p>The appellant had been convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of the deceased under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. In this appeal, the appellant did not challenge the findings of fact by the learned judge. The main issue raised by the appellant was that the autopsy report by Dr Savior Selva Suresh MD ("Dr Suresh"), a forensic specialist at Sibu General Hospital, Sibu, Sarawak, admitted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC")</LINK> was inadmissible because Dr Suresh was not a medical doctor authorised under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the Medical Act 1971 ("MA 1971")</LINK> to perform functions specified in that section, one of which was to perform a post-mortem on the deceased to establish the cause of death. Therefore it was argued that Dr Suresh was not a medical officer within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(2)(b) of the CPC</LINK> as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK>. Further, Dr Suresh was not called by the prosecution to testify as to his autopsy report at the trial. As such it was argued and submitted that there was no medical evidence as to the injuries suffered by or inflicted on the deceased that allegedly caused his death. On the other hand, the deputy prosecutor submitted that the autopsy report was admissible as the prosecution had complied with the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of the CPC</LINK>. Furthermore, the autopsy report was served on the appellant before the trial and the appellant had acknowledged receipt of the report. It was also submitted that the appellant was informed of his right to call Dr Suresh to testify in court, but no such notice was given to the prosecution by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Here, the choice of the word 'includes' instead of the word 'means' by the draftsman or the legislature in the definition of the terms 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK> was deliberate. Thus, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK> was not confined to a medical officer, either provisionally registered or fully registered, who was employed by the Government of Malaysia and appointed to a medical service in the public service of Malaysia, but could be extended to embrace any other medical officer for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(2) of the CPC</LINK> if such medical officer was authorised in writing by the Director General of Health pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the MA 1971</LINK>, including a private practitioner. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant appeal, there was no merit in the argument that Dr Suresh was not a medical officer within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK>. At the material time, Dr Suresh was a registered medical practitioner in the employment of the Government of Malaysia and was a member of the medical service of the public service of Malaysia. Being a government medical officer, Dr Suresh did not require any written authorisation by the Director General of Health of Malaysia to perform the autopsy or the postmortem on the deceased. A government medical doctor was deemed to have such authorisation or the authorisation could be implied by virtue of their appointment in the medical service of the public service of Malaysia. Accordingly, the written authorisation by the Director General of Health under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the MA 1971</LINK> was only required by a registered medical practitioner other than those in the employment of the Government of Malaysia and a member of the medical service of the public service of Malaysia.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, Yii Ming Tung was charged for murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging after a full trial. This is his appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Material Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 8 May 2009 at about 9.00pm a group of friends comprising Mansorah bin Su'ud (PW2), Rajis ak Akau (PW3) and Regina ak Francis (PW4) and the deceased Alexander ak Ganok gathered at the five-foot way in front of a shop near to the Standard Chartered Bank at Jalan Blacksmith, Sibu for a drinking session.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> While they were there drinking, the appellant approached the deceased and attacked him with a sharp object. He also attacked and injured PW2 who tried to protect the deceased. Five days later the deceased passed away due to complication of the penetrating injury to the abdomen. The appellant was subsequently charged in court for the offence of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The prosecution relied on the testimonies of PW2, PW3 and PW4 who were the eye-witnesses to the incident. Their testimonies show that they were having drinks at the five-foot way. PW2 was leaning against the wall about 3 meters away from PW3 and PW4. PW3 was about 2½ meters from the deceased and PW4 was sitting just next to the deceased at an arm's length distance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> PW2 said that while they were having drinks, the appellant came and stabbed the deceased on the back with a sharp object which he estimated to be about 5½ inches long with the width the size of his thumb, ie 1.5 cm, without saying a word. But he could not see clearly what the sharp object was as it was dark. He said he was already drunk (having consumed five-six bottles) at the time the appellant appeared and stabbed the deceased. Nevertheless, he tried to stop the appellant from attacking the deceased and the appellant also attacked and hurt him. PW2 fled and was subsequently admitted to the Sibu Hospital for treatment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In cross-examination PW2 said the appellant stabbed the deceased only once at the back and at the waist. PW2 said he was not really drunk at the time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> PW3 testified that he was drunk at the time of the incident but still alert to the happening around him. He saw the appellant coming towards where they were drinking and there was at first a fight between the deceased and the appellant. Thereafter the appellant stabbed the deceased's back first and then the chest. He did not see the weapon used by the appellant as he was some distance from the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> He confirmed that after stabbing the deceased, the appellant also stabbed PW2, who then fled from the scene. He and PW4 also ran away from the scene.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> PW4 testified that the appellant suddenly appeared at the scene and she heard him said "I want to stab Alexander for revenge" prior to stabbing the deceased on the back, chest and waist with a knife.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In cross-examination PW4 said the appellant stabbed the deceased at the waist first followed by the chest and then at the back. According to PW4, they had consumed one bottle of liquor before the incident and they were not really drunk. PW3 admitted that with only street light lighting the five-foot way, she could not see things very clearly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> PW2, PW3 and PW4 were all able to positively identify the appellant in the dock as the assailant as they used to see the appellant around before the incident. They had also identified the appellant in the ID parade held by the police.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The autopsy report (exh P7), admitted pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)</LINK>, stated the findings of the autopsy performed on the deceased by one Dr Savior Selva Suresh, forensic specialist at the Sibu Hospital, on 14 May 2009. It reveals, amongst others, the following injuries:</p>

    <p>
      <b>The Issue And The Appellant's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The main issue raised by the appellant in this appeal is that the autopsy report (exh P7) by Dr Savior Selva Suresh MD a forensic specialist at Sibu General Hospital, Sibu Sarawak admitted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">under s 399 of CPC</LINK> is inadmissible because, it was submitted for the appellant, Dr Suresh is not a medical doctor authorized under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of Medical Act 1971 (Act 50)</LINK>. Dr Suresh, who conducted the post-mortem on the deceased, was not called by the prosecution to testify as to his autopsy report at the trial. As such it was argued and submitted that there is no medical evidence as to the injuries suffered by or inflicted on the deceased that allegedly caused his death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is no evidence to show that Dr Suresh had authorisation in writing by the Director General of Health of Malaysia under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the Medical Act 1971</LINK> to perform functions specified in that section - one of which is to perform post-mortem on the dead to establish the cause of death. Therefore it was argued that Dr Suresh was not a medical officer within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(2)(b)</LINK> as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> For the purpose of this appeal the relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(2) CPC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the Medical Act 1971</LINK> are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> To support his argument learned counsel for the appellant cited to us an unreported Court of Appeal case of <i>Winnie Yek Leh Cheng v. PP</i> (Rayuan Jenayah No: Q-05-261-2010) (unreported) where the prosecution sought to admit into evidence the autopsy report by the same witness Dr Suresh on the deceased in that case under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of CPC</LINK> without calling the doctor to come and testify at the trial. It was impressed upon us that in that case the Court of Appeal ruled that the autopsy report was not admissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of CPC</LINK> because Dr Suresh was not a government medical officer under that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(2)(a)</LINK>; accordingly the conviction in that case was set aside and the appeal was allowed. Our comment on this submission by the learned counsel for the appellant is that we are unable to express any views on that case because no written grounds of judgment was made available to us and the case was not reported. We were only shown the sealed copy of the order of the Court of Appeal in that case. We have to take the learned counsel's word for it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondent's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned deputy prosecutor submitted that the autopsy report (exh P7) is admissible. The prosecution had complied with the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(1) of CPC</LINK>. The autopsy report exh P7 was served on the appellant two months before the trial and the appellant had acknowledged receipt as evident in exh P4. It was also submitted that the appellant was informed of his right to call the doctor who prepared the autopsy report to testify in court by giving the prosecution a three days notice. There was no such notice given to the prosecution by the appellant. The learned deputy public prosecutor cited a string of authorities - <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1990_2_60;"><i>Public Prosecutor v.

    <p>
      <b>Our Opinions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We will begin by observing that the appellant did not dispute the fact that Dr Suresh is a qualified medical doctor and was at the material times the forensic specialist at Sibu General Hospital, Sibu, Sarawak. Being attached to the Sibu General Hospital which is a government hospital, Dr Suresh was no doubt a government medical officer unless there is evidence to show otherwise; and there was no such evidence produced by the appellant. The one and only complaint by the appellant is that Dr Suresh was never authorised under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the Medical Act 1971</LINK> by the Director General of Health of Malaysia to perform any of the functions under that section; and one of the functions is to perform autopsy or post-mortem investigation of any deceased person. Therefore, according to the appellant, Dr Suresh is not a government medical officer within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(2) of CPC</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of CPC</LINK> which defines 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' for the purpose of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;;">CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In our view the answer to the appellant's complaint lies in the construction of the definition of the term 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We note that the definitive section reads 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' includes a medical practitioner ...' In our opinion the expression 'medical practitioner' in the definition would naturally refer to the 'provisionally registered medical practitioner' or 'fully registered medical 'practitioner' as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;2.;;">s 2 of the Medical Act 1971</LINK> since it is the only Act that registers all medical practitioners in this country who wish to practice medicine.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The emphasis is on the word 'includes' in the definition of the terms 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK>. In our view the choice of the word 'includes' instead of the word 'means' by the draftsman or the legislature in the above definition is deliberate. It is to show that the reference to 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' under the relevant section is not confined to a medical officer, either provisionally registered or fully registered, who is employed by the Government of Malaysia and appointed to a medical service in the public service of Malaysia. The usage of the word 'includes' in the definition is to extend the meaning of the term 'government medical officer' to embrace any other medical officer who is not a member of the medical service in the public service of Malaysia or in the employment of the Government of Malaysia and deemed to be a government medical officer or a medical officer for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;399.;;">s 399(2) of the CPC</LINK> if such medical officer is authorised in writing by the Director General of Health pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the Medical Act 1971</LINK>. What this means is that, a fully registered medical practitioner who is a private practitioner may be authorised by the Director General of Health of Malaysia under the said section of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;;">Medical Act 1971</LINK> for the purpose of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;;">CPC</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[23]</b> The meaning of the word 'includes' to indicate extension instead of limitation was discussed in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1984_1_256;"><i>Public Prosecutor v.

    <blockquote>

    <p>had this to say with regards to the word 'includes' in the definition:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The two cases cited above support the view that the usage of the word 'includes' in the drafting of the definition 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK> shows that the definition is non exhaustive as compared to the usage of the word 'means' which indicates an exhaustive definition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Textbook writers on legislative drafting and interpretation of statutes also support the view that the usage of the word 'includes' in drafting a provision of a legislation indicates an extended meaning of the terms or things that the provisions were meant to describe. GC Thornton in his authoritative book "<i>Legislative Drafting</i>" (4th edn) said at p 146 on the usage of the word 'includes' as a drafting tool to extend a particular definition or meaning of a term in the statute as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The authors of "<i>NS Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes</i>" (9th edn) (Publisher: LexisNexis Butterworths) have these to comments on the usage of the word 'includes' in the drafting of a provision of a statute:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Therefore, it is our considered view that the definition of 'government medical officer' or 'medical officer' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of the CPC</LINK> has an extended meaning to include a private medical practitioner who is not a government medical officer or a medical officer who has been authorised in writing under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of the Medical Act 1971</LINK> to perform the functions specified under the section.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Accordingly, we find no merit in the argument by the learned counsel for the appellant that Dr Suresh is not a medical officer within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;2.;;">s 2 of CPC</LINK>. We observe that there is no question about Dr Suresh being, at the material time, a registered medical practitioner in the employment of the Government of Malaysia and is a member of the medical service of the public service of Malaysia and served in the capacity of forensic specialist attached to the government hospital at Sibu General Hospital, Sarawak. Being a government medical officer, Dr Suresh did not require any written authorisation by the Director General of Health of Malaysia to perform the autopsy or the postmortem on the deceased. In our view, a government medical doctor is deemed to have such authorisation or that the authorisation can be implied by virtue of their appointment in the medical service of the public service of Malaysia. The written authorisation by the Director General of Health under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of Medical Act 1971</LINK> to perform autopsy or post-mortem on a deceased person is only required by a registered medical practitioner other than those in the employment of the Government of Malaysia and a member of the medical service of the public service of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> On the foregoing arguments we hold Dr Suresh is a government medical officer and that the autopsy or post-mortem report (exh P7) prepared by him in this case was properly admitted in evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Besides the issue of Dr Suresh not being authorised under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of Medical Act 1971</LINK>, the appellant also raised other grounds in his petition of appeal. However, in the course of submission and arguments before us, learned counsel for the appellant did not pursue these grounds. He was content only to rely on the principal issue discussed above relating to the authorisation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_50;34C.;;">s 34C of Medical Act 1971</LINK>. We therefore deem it that the appellant has abandoned all these other grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> That being the case, and in view of what we have said above on the principal issue, we find no merits in this appeal and we accordingly dismiss it. We affirm the conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court on the appellant.</p>
