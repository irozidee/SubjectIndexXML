    <p>The appellant trade union ("appellant") and the respondent employer failed to conclude a collective agreement ("CA") proposed by the respondent on terms and conditions of employment of the respondent's employees represented by the appellant. The matter was referred to the Industrial Court which handed down an Award. The respondent was dissatisfied with the Award and applied to the High Court for certiorari to quash the Award. The High Court found <i>inter alia</i> that the Industrial Court had stated the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ("the Act")</LINK> without indicating how the principles had been applied. In short, the Industrial Court had failed to give effect to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4) of the Act</LINK>. The High Court thus allowed the application with costs and the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In making an Award in respect of a trade dispute, the Industrial Court is obliged by law to have regard to: (a) the public interest; (b) the financial implications and the effect of the Award on the economy of the country and on the industry concerned; and (c) the probable effect in related or similar industries. Strict compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4) of the Act</LINK> is necessary. (paras 25-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> A mere statement of compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4) of the Act</LINK> is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of that provision. In the instant case, the decisionmaking process was flawed and the Award was made without compliance with the relevant and mandatory provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4) of the Act</LINK>. The Industrial Court had committed an error of law which rendered the whole Award invalid. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Inferior courts, statutory tribunals and other authorities are not given the jurisdiction to make an error of law and such error of law, whether on the face of the record or not, in reality goes to jurisdiction. (paras 33-34)</p>

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aziah Ali JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, Paper and Paper Products Manufacturing Employees' Union and the respondent Tri-Wall (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, had failed to conclude the first collective agreement ("CA") proposed by the respondent on terms and conditions of employment of the respondent's employees who came under the scope of representation of the appellant. The effective date of the CA was from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2010.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The Honourable Minister then referred the trade dispute to the Industrial Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;26.;;">s 26(2) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ("the Act")</LINK>. The reference culminated in the Award No: 444 of 2011 ("the Award").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Dissatisfied with the Award, the respondent then filed an application to the High Court for judicial review for an order of certiorari to quash the Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The High Court allowed the application with costs, hence this appeal. We had dismissed the appeal. The deposit was awarded as costs to the respondent. We now give our reasons below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At the Industrial Court, the parties had agreed to 32 articles but five articles were in dispute namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Industrial Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Article 3 (Scope Of The Ca And Some Job Categories In Appendix A To The Ca)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The respondent identified four job categories with either Managerial, executive or confidential functions that ought to be excluded from the scope of the CA. The job categories which the respondent identified were Factory Supervisor, Store Supervisor, Purchasing Supervisor and Assistant Supervisor. The appellant had proposed four new job categories/salary groups namely Skilled Operators, Senior Skilled Operators, Office Boy and Office Cleaner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Industrial Court rejected the appellant's proposal because it was of the view that it was the prerogative of the management to decide on job categories/ salary groups. However the Industrial Court deleted some of the job categories and added some job categories in the salary scale proposed by the appellant to conform with that proposed by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Article 7 (Rest Days)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Industrial Court accepted the respondent's proposal on rest days which the Industrial Court finds are similar to the provisions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_265;60.;;">s 60(3)(b) of the Employment Act 1955</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Article 14 (Medical Attention)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Industrial Court accepted the respondent's proposal on medical attention with some amendments. The Industrial Court also increased the limit of medical coverage for employees who had not been hospitalised to RM2,000.00 per employee per year.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Article 29 (Transport Subsidy)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The respondent had proposed an increase of transport subsidy for employees who were not provided transport from RM40.00 per month to RM50.00. The appellant on the other hand proposed an increase to RM100.00. The Industrial Court allowed an increase to RM80.00 per month.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Article 38 (Salary Adjustment And The Salary Structure In Appendix A To The Ca)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> From 2006 to 2010 the respondent had given a cumulative annual salary adjustment which ranged from 7.5% to 34.2%. The cumulative increase in the consumer price index from 2007 to 2009 was 7.5%. The salary adjustments took into consideration the increase in costs of living and the increase in the consumer price index. The respondent therefore proposed no salary adjustment. The appellant had proposed a salary adjustment of 9% of the basic salary. The Industrial Court allowed a salary adjustment of 8% of the basic salary as at 30 June 2007 in order to provide job stability for employees.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The respondent followed the 'Hays competency benefit system' ("the Hays system") in respect of the appraisal of the employees' performance. The Hays system requires assessors to undergo training. However none of the assessors except for COW1 has had any training.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> According to the Hays system, 70% of the points were given for performance and 30% for attendance. The average appraisal rating was taken from four appraisal ratings. Deductions will be made from the appraisal rating if an employee takes more than two days of medical leave or unpaid leave in the particular year.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The respondent's employees were paid attendance allowance of RM50.00. If an employee took two days of medical leave, RM25.00 would be deducted from the allowance. If the employee took unpaid leave, a further RM25.00 would be deducted. No deduction would be made for hospitalisation. The Industrial Court found this practice to be unfair on the basis that the employee would be penalised twice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The Industrial Court found that the salary system practiced by the respondent does not reflect a fair value for the work the employees are doing. The Industrial Court is of the view that if the respondent intends to implement a salary/wage system LINKed to performance, the best system would be the 'Productivity LINKed Wage System' (PLWS) where there is consultation with the union on the criteria for the assessment of the employees' performance and the formula for ascertaining the profitability of the company. There is a fixed component and a variable component for annual increments in salary and bonus.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The respondent had proposed a salary scale with a minimum and maximum salary for each group/job category but no fixed annual increment. The annual increments were given based on an employee's last drawn salary as at 31<sup>st</sup> March of each year and on his/her performance in the previous year. The appellant had proposed a salary scale with a minimum and maximum salary and fixed annual increment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The Industrial Court accepted the salary scale proposed by appellant which it found to be fair and reasonable after having considered the increase in the consumer price index for the period prior to the commencement date of the CA and the respondent's financial capacity to pay.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Industrial Court awarded annual increments on the 1<sup>st</sup> April of each year to all confirmed employees but employees with less than 12 months of continuous service as at 30<sup>th</sup> March will be paid annual increments on a prorata basis. With regard to employees who are earning the maximum salary or more than the maximum salary in his salary group, the Industrial Court had decided that these employees will continue to draw that salary on a personal to holder basis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The respondent was also ordered to pay one lump sum <i>ex gratia</i> payment of RM1,000.00 to each confirmed employee covered by the CA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The job categories/salary groups and salary scale as determined by the Industrial Court can be found at pp 460-461 of the Appeal Record.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Before the High Court, the respondent's contentions are essentially as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Briefly, the High Court Judge found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The High Court found that the Industrial Court has failed to give effect to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4) of the Act</LINK>. At p 7 of the grounds of judgment, the High Court Judge states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Chairman of the Industrial Court had clearly stated that she had taken into account <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4) of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">Section 30(4)</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_1_303;"><i>Mersing Omnibus Co Sdn Bhd v. Kesatuan Pekerja-Pekerja Pengangkutan Semenanjung Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1998] 1 MLRH 303</LINK>; [1999] 1 MLJ 44, Nik Hashim J stated amongst others that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus in making an award in respect of a trade dispute, the Industrial Court is obliged by law to have regard to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The strict compliance of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4)</LINK> was emphasised by Nik Hashim J in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_5_145;"><i>Lam Soon (M) Bhd v. Kesatuan Pekerja-Pekerja Perkilangan Perusahaan Makanan</i> [1998] 5 MLRH 145</LINK>; [1999] 3 MLJ 347 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We have perused the Award and we find that, in respect of the salary scale, the Industrial Court had stated that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> With regard to salary adjustment, this is what the Industrial Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The Award concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1982_2_193;"><i>Malayan Commercial Banks' Association v. National Union Of Bank Employees</i> [1982] 2 MELR 193</LINK> [1982] 2 ILR 288a, which was referred to by Nik Hashim J in his judgment in <i>Lam Soon (M) Bhd v. Kesatuan Pekerja-Pekerja Perkilangan Perusahaan Makanan (supra)</i>, Harun J said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We find from the Award that, in accepting the salary scale as proposed by the appellant, and in allowing salary adjustment of 8%, there is no indication that the Industrial Court has considered the salary levels in related or similar industries, the effect of the award on the industry concerned and the probable effect in related or similar industries, and on the economy of the country.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We agreed with the learned High Court Judge that a mere statement of compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4)</LINK> is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of that provision. We find that the decision making process is flawed and the Award was made without compliance with the relevant and mandatory provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(4)</LINK>. The Industrial Court has committed an error of law which rendered the whole Award invalid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Inferior courts and statutory tribunals and other authorities are not given the jurisdiction to make an error of law and it follows that such error of law, whether on the face of the record or not, in reality goes to jurisdiction. (Per VC George JCA in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_268;"><i>Syarikat Kenderaan Melayu Kelantan Bhd v. Transport Workers Union</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 268</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 317; [1995] 2 CLJ 748; [1995] 2 AMR 1601).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We find that the High Court had decided correctly in allowing the application to set aside the whole Award as prayed. For the aforesaid reasons we dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
