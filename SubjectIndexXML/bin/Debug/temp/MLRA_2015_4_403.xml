    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his conviction and sentence for trafficking in dangerous drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('the Act')</LINK>. Following a drug raid by the police on the appellant's hotel room ('the room'), the police found a packet containing substances believed to be drugs and accordingly arrested the appellant. The said packet was later confirmed by the chemist to contain methamphetamine ('the drugs'). During the trial, the appellant put forward a defence of no knowledge in regards to the possession of the drugs found in the room. At the end of the defence case, the trial judge found that the appellant's explanation that he did not have exclusive use of the room was "unworthy of belief" and accordingly found him guilty. Hence, the main issues for determination were, whether the prosecution needed to prove exclusive possession of the drugs before the presumption of trafficking could be invoked; whether the appellant had disproved the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>; whether the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> ceased to operate and became a dead letter of the law once the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> was invoked; and whether the trial judge erred in her findings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (unanimously dismissing the appeal)</p>
    <p>Per Abdul Rahman Sebli, JCA delivering the judgment of the court:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> With regard to the question of possession, in PP v. Denish Madhaven the apex court decided that proof of possession need not be exclusive to the accused. It was therefore unnecessary for the prosecution to prove exclusive possession of the drugs before the presumption of trafficking could be invoked against the appellant. By the same token, if possession of the subject matter of the charge need not be exclusive, there was no reason why exclusive use of the room in this instance must be established. Once <i>mens rea</i> possession was established against the appellant, it was immaterial if he had exclusive use of the room or otherwise. (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The amount of said drugs found in the appellant's possession exceeded the minimum prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. Therefore, the court must act on the supposition that the drugs in the appellant's possession was for the purpose of trafficking, "until the contrary is proved" by the appellant. The fact that the prosecution adduced no evidence to prove that the drugs were for the purpose of trafficking was irrelevant. It was for the appellant to displace the presumption. (paras 32-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The intention of Parliament in enacting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> was to relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving knowledge. By the reversal of the onus of proof, it was for the appellant to prove in the negative that he had no knowledge of the drugs and not for the prosecution to prove positively that he had the requisite knowledge. That was the proper construction to be given to the words "until the contrary is proved" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>. Those words mean that until and unless the appellant proved to the contrary on the balance of probabilities, the law presumed as a matter of fact that he had knowledge of the drugs. The word "shall" used in the section meant it was mandatory. Hence, the only question for the trial court to consider was whether the presumption applied on the facts. If it applied then the appellant must be deemed to have had knowledge of the drugs. In the instant case, since the trial judge's finding was that the drugs were in the appellant's possession at the time of his arrest, he must as a matter of common sense have had custody or control of the drugs as well. Therefore, by operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>, he was deemed to have had knowledge of the drugs. The legal burden then shifted to the appellant to prove that he had no knowledge. (paras 36-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Having regard to the legislative scheme of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37 of the Act</LINK>, the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> continued to operate against the accused person even where the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> operated against him. This did not offend the rule against double presumption because the question of invoking the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to further invoke the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> did not arise at all. Trafficking was presumed because the accused was found in "possession" of the drugs whilst knowledge was presumed because he was found in custody or control of the drugs. Thus, the factual elements that triggered the activations of those two presumptions were entirely different. (paras 43-44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the present case, despite bearing the burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>, being in possession of more than the minimum weight prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(xvi) of the Act</LINK>, the appellant chose not to discharge that burden. Not a shred of evidence was adduced by the appellant to show that the drugs were not for the purpose of trafficking. What the appellant did in this case was to sidestep his burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking by raising a defence of "no knowledge" which did not go towards proving that the drugs were not for the purpose of trafficking. The presumption of trafficking therefore remained unrebutted. (<i>Cohen Lorraine Philis &amp; Anor v. PP (distd)</i>). (paras 45-46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Given the line of defence adopted by the appellant, the trial judge was not expected to make a finding that the drugs were not for the purpose of trafficking for the simple reason that there was no material before the court for her to make such finding. What was before the trial judge was only the appellant's claim that he had no knowledge of the drugs. It was axiomatic that the court acted on evidence laid before it and nothing else. Nevertheless, the trial judge proceeded to consider whether the presumption of trafficking had been rebutted and it was her finding that the appellant failed to rebut the presumption. (para 51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> In dealing with the defence case the trial judge's approach was to determine whether the appellant's explanation had cast a reasonable doubt in her mind as to the truth of the prosecution's case. In doing so she had duly drawn her attention to the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. Having looked at the totality of the evidence, the trial judge concluded that the appellant's defence was "a fabrication concocted only at a late stage in his attempt to avoid culpability". On the evidence before her, there was nothing wrong with the trial judge's conclusion to warrant appellate intervention. (paras 61-62)</p>
    <p>Per Ahmadi Asnawi JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was not necessary for the trial judge to invoke the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> where there was sufficient evidence of direct possession from which knowledge could be inferred from the facts without resorting to the aid provided under the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>. The presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> was only to enable the court to attribute knowledge where there was, under the circumstances, no direct evidence upon which an inference of knowledge could be drawn against the accused person. (para 78)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The presumption of possession of the dangerous drugs was in respect of any person who was found to have had in his custody or under his control anything whatsoever containing any dangerous drugs and not a presumption of possession of any dangerous drugs found in the physical custody or control of the accused person. It would be completely absurd to mandatorily suggest the invocation of the presumption of possession over one who had been found to be in physical custody or control of the drugs. Hence, it makes complete sense to have the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs under the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to run in tandem with the presumption of possession under the first limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> which was grounded solely upon proved custody or control of anything whatsoever containing dangerous drugs. Mere custody or control without more was insufficient to attribute knowledge. The presumption of knowledge was thus a requisition to complete the mental element of possession. (paras 80-81)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant appeal, the trial judge found that the appellant had actual <i>mens rea</i> possession and went on to find that once actual <i>mens rea</i> possession had been proved, the statutory presumption of trafficking of the drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(xvi) of the Act</LINK> could be invoked as the amount of the drugs was in excess of the statutory limit and accordingly, ordered the appellant to enter his defence on the charge of trafficking in the drugs. Therefore, the issue of the appellant having to carry the burden of rebutting the presumption of knowledge and possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> did not arise. In this instance, to earn an outright acquittal, there were two imperatives which must necessarily be embedded in the defence of the appellant, ie the burden to rebut, on the balance of probabilities, the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> and/ or the evidential burden to raise a reasonable doubt in respect of possession of the drugs. Hence, the issue of breaching the rule against double presumption on account that the presumption of trafficking in the drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> was invoked, was in fact a non-issue altogether.

    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, an Iranian national was charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug and the charge against him was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the conclusion of the trial he was found guilty and sentenced to death by the Kuala Lumpur High Court. This is his appeal against the conviction and sentence. Having heard arguments by both parties, we dismissed his appeal by a unanimous decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> My learned brothers Justice Mohtarudin Baki and Justice Ahmadi Asnawi have read this judgment and have approved the same except that for Justice Ahmadi Asnawi, His Lordship has a dissenting view on the application of the statutory presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the DDA")</LINK> and has written separate grounds in respect thereof.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The facts may briefly be stated as follows. On 20 February 2011 at about 8.00pm Chief Inspector Suresh a/l D Muniandy (PW4) was carrying out "Operasi Tapis" at Jalan Tun Razak with five other police officers. When they were in the vicinity of Cabbana Inn Hotel ("Cabbana Hotel"), PW4 saw a male Indian walking towards the hotel in a suspicious manner. He was seen entering Cabbana Hotel and into the lift. PW4 noticed that the lift stopped at the 11<sup>th</sup> floor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> PW4 and his team went up to the 11<sup>th</sup> floor using the lift. On their arrival at the floor, the male Indian was standing in front of the door to room 1109 and the door was opened from inside by a man later identified as the appellant. There is no dispute that this room was registered under the appellant's name.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> A search was then carried out on the male Indian by two members of the police team but nothing incriminating was found on him. He was also tested for methamphetamine but the test result was negative. This male Indian turned out to be a taxi driver by the name of Murugan a/l Ayyavoo who had merely gone to the room to fetch the appellant on a prior appointment. He was called as a prosecution witness (PW7).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> PW4 and the rest of the team entered room 1109 and carried out a search. From inside the upper drawer of a small cabinet located on the right side of the bed, PW4 found a plastic packet containing substances believed to be drug along with the appellant's personal belongings, namely his wristwatch and passport. From the dressing table the police found a Sony Erricson handphone, RM20 cash, Iranian currency 10500 and the key to room 1109.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant's urine sample that was taken later at the police station tested positive for methamphetamine. According to PW4, the accused panicked when the search was being carried out in room 1109 and after the drug was found, he was in a state of shock and asked to be released ("dalam keadaan terkejut, takut dan minta dilepaskan").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The cross-examination of PW4 revealed that when the search in the room was over, someone knocked the door from the outside. It was an Iranian man by the name of Hameed Reza. He was arrested and later charged with possession of a dangerous drug under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1) the DDA</LINK>. His arrest was the subject of a separate police investigation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The plastic packet that was found in the drawer of room 1109 was sent for analysis and confirmed by the Chemist Maimonah binti Sulaiman (PW3) to contain 61.74 grams of methamphetamine, a dangerous drug listed in the First Schedule of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK>. The learned trial judge found no issue with the identity of the drug. Possession without lawful authority of 50 grams or more of this drug triggers the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the DDA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On these facts, the learned trial judge was satisfied, relying on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_333;"><i>Magendran Mohan v. PP</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 333</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 1; [2011] 1 CLJ 805; [2011] 2 AMR 680 that a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking had been established against the appellant and accordingly called for his defence. It was her finding that the appellant was in <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drug, meaning to say he was knowingly in possession of the drug. The appellant was therefore presumed to be trafficking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In stating his defence the appellant chose to give evidence on oath. His explanation was as follows. Before his arrest on 20 February 2011 he worked as a pilot in Iran. He came to Malaysia on 11 February 2011 on a holiday and it was only his second visit to Malaysia. On this occasion he said he came with three other Iranians namely Mohamad, Hameed Afshar and Parna. He confirmed that room No 1109 of Cabbana Hotel was rented under his name. He said Mohamad and his girlfriend (Parna) stayed in the room to the left of room 1109 while Hameed stayed with his relative in Ampang.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant went on to explain that room 1109 was not used exclusively by him as his friends Mohamad, Hameed Afshar, Parna, Nilofar (a female) and Iman (a male), all Iranians had also been to the room from 11 February 2011 to 20 February 2011. According to him Iman even stayed with him in the room for one night before he left for Thailand. He said he "might" have given the room key to Iman and Hameed when they wanted to use the washroom or when they wanted to put their shopping bags inside the room.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant added that shortly before his arrest on 20 February 2011, PW7 came over to his room to fetch him as he had an appointment with Nilofar. He explained that prior to 20 February 2011 he had used PW7's taxi for "clubbing" and going to Nilofar's house. According to him PW7 stayed in the room for 5-10 minutes. Then he heard a knock on the door and when he opened it, a gun was pointed into the room. He said he was then handcuffed from behind by PW4.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> There was no suggestion in cross-examination nor in argument before us that PW7 had anything to do with the drug. Therefore nothing more should be read into the appellant's evidence that PW7 was present in room 1109 for 5-10 minutes before the arrival of the police. With regard to the discovery of the drug, the appellant confirmed PW4's evidence that the plastic packet was found from the drawer in room 1109. This is what he said in his evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> He was however unable to identify if exh P8 was the plastic packet that the police found in the drawer. He denied that he was in a state of shock and had asked to be released after the drug was found. He said he had no idea how the drug came to be in the drawer. He denied that the drug belonged to him. He said he did not know anything about the drug.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Without a doubt the appellant's defence was that he had no knowledge of the drug. It was his suggestion that the drug "could have" been left behind by any of his Iranian friends or the hotel maid. According to him the hotel maid cleaned the room daily regardless of whether he was present in the room or otherwise. There was even a suggestion that someone hoping for a reward "could have" placed the drug inside the drawer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In the light of the evidence established by the prosecution at the close of its case, particularly the appellant's conduct during the search and after the discovery of the drug, his defence can be described as nothing more than a bare denial. He offered no plausible explanation as to why he panicked when the search was being carried out and then asking to be released when the drug was found. If indeed he had nothing to do with the drug, there was no reason for him to panic and asking to be released.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;9.;;">s 9 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> the appellant was duty bound to explain his conduct: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717. A bare denial is not sufficient to dislodge the evidence established by the prosecution. Nor did the appellant explain how his wristwatch and passport came to be in the same drawer where the drug was found except to contradict the prosecution's evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Having weighed all the relevant facts, the learned trial judge found that the appellant failed to cast any reasonable doubt as to the truth of the prosecution's case. She was satisfied that the case against the appellant had been proved beyond any reasonable doubt. She rejected the defence suggestion that the drug could have been left behind by his friends. Her finding is at p 142 of the Record of Appeal, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> As for the appellant's suggestion that it could be the work of the hotel maid, the learned judge's finding was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In this appeal, counsel for the appellant raised three issues, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Ground (1) relates to the learned DPP's statement in the opening address (P3) that the plastic packet containing the drug was found "di bahagian atas laci di tepi katil". According to counsel this contradicted PW4's testimony that the plastic packet was found "pada laci sebelah kanan katil di bahagian atas". We found no substance to the argument as it is clear that the plastic packet was found inside the upper drawer of the cabinet and not on the cabinet itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We found nothing in the learned DPP's opening statement to support counsel's suggestion that the plastic packet was found on the cabinet. The words "di bahagian atas laci di tepi katil" in the opening statement must be understood in the context of PW5's description of the cabinet as "meja jenis laci, ada dua laci". Clearly it was a cabinet with two drawers, one on top of the other and the drug was found inside the top drawer. It is worth noting that even the appellant himself in his evidence described it as "a cabinet with two or three drawers." More importantly he confirmed that the plastic packet was taken by PW4 from inside a drawer. Ground (1) must fail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Grounds (2) and (3) relate to a common issue and we shall deal with them together. The first thing to note with regard to these grounds is that they were directed at the learned trial judge's finding that the appellant was knowingly in possession of the drug. In her judgment the learned trial judge made it clear that she rejected the appellant's story that the drug could have been put in the drawer by his Iranian friends or the hotel maid without his knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned trial judge's finding was that the appellant's explanation was "unworthy of belief ". We found no reason to interfere with this finding of fact which no doubt depended on the credibility and reliability of the appellant as a witness. On the evidence before her and having seen the appellant giving evidence, the learned trial judge was perfectly entitled to arrive at such finding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The thrust of the appellant's argument in the High Court and repeated before us was that the prosecution failed to prove exclusive use of room 1109 and that therefore the appellant had no exclusive possession of the drug. It follows, going by the argument, that the appellant could not have been trafficking in the drug. We found no merit in the argument. First of all there is no law to say that the prosecution must prove exclusive use of a room before a conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the DDA</LINK> can be sustained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> What the prosecution needs to establish to bring home a charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the DDA</LINK> is possession of the drug and that the accused was trafficking in it. To prove these two elements the prosecution is aided by the statutory presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the DDA</LINK>. We shall come back to these two presumptions shortly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> With regard to the question of possession, it has been decided by the apex court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_116;"><i>PP v. Denish Madhavan</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 116</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 194; [2009] 2 CLJ 209 that proof of possession need not be exclusive to the accused. It is therefore unnecessary for the prosecution to prove exclusive possession of the drug before the presumption of trafficking could be invoked against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> By the same token, if possession of the subject matter of the charge need not be exclusive, there is no reason why exclusive use of the room must be established. Once <i>mens rea</i> possession is established against the appellant, it is immaterial if he had exclusive use of the room or otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> If exclusive use of a hotel room was a relevant factor in considering whether possession is established, it will virtually be impossible for the authorities to enforce the drug laws as it will always be open to the defence to point out, and rightly so, that at one point or another, someone else would have had prior access to the room. Surely the hotel management itself would have had access to the room.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The amount of drug found in the appellant's possession exceeded the minimum prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the DDA</LINK>. The court must therefore act on the supposition that the drug in the appellant's possession was for the purpose of trafficking, "until the contrary is proved" by the appellant: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_560;"><i>PP v. Zulkifli Arshad</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 560</LINK>; [2011] 1 MLJ 599; [2010] 6 CLJ 121.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In point of law, if the appellant failed to adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption of trafficking, he must be convicted of the offence charged as the fact presumed, ie that the drug was for the purpose of trafficking would have remained unrebutted. The fact that the prosecution adduced no evidence to prove that the drug was for the purpose of trafficking is irrelevant. It was for the appellant to displace the presumption. This is implicit in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;102.;;">s 102 of the Evidence Act 1950 ("the Evidence Act")</LINK> which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> This brings us to the issue of knowledge, which is an essential ingredient of the offence of trafficking as knowledge is the sine qua non of "possession". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">Section 37(d) of the DDA</LINK> is relevant and stipulates as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The golden rule of statutory interpretation is that ordinary words must be given their ordinary meanings and technical words their technical meanings, unless absurdity would result. It is be noted that there are two things presumed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>, the first being "possession" of the drug and secondly "knowledge" as to the nature of the drug. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2015_101;"><i>PP v. Hamid Shamsi Kavishasi</i> [2015] MLRAU 101</LINK> this court held the view that the word "possession" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> cannot mean possession as the word is understood in criminal law, ie possession with both the physical and mental elements. This is what the court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Obviously the intention of Parliament in enacting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK> is to relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving knowledge, which is another way of saying that the prosecution need not prove knowledge. By the reversal of the onus of proof, it is for the accused to prove in the negative that he had no knowledge of the drug and not for the prosecution to prove positively that he had the requisite knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In our view that is the proper construction to be given to the words "until the contrary is proved" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. These words mean that until and unless the accused proves to the contrary on the balance of probabilities, the law (and not the judge nor the Public Prosecutor) presumes as a matter of fact that he had knowledge of the drug.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It is a supposition of law that requires no deliberation on the part of the trial judge in deciding whether to apply or not to apply the presumption once custody or control is established: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_311;"><i>Muhammed Hassan v. PP</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 311</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 273; [1998] 2 CLJ 170; [1998] 1 AMR 829. The word "shall" used in the section connotes its mandatory nature. This is different from, for example drawing inferences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114 of the Evidence Act</LINK> which uses the word "may". The only question for the trial court to consider is whether the presumption applies on the facts. If it applies then the accused must be deemed to have had knowledge of the drug.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In the present case, since the learned trial judge's finding was that the drug was in the appellant's possession at the time of his arrest, he must as a matter of common sense have had custody or control of the drug as well. Therefore, by operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK>, he is deemed to have had knowledge of the drug. The legal burden then shifted to the appellant to prove that he had no knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Before the present <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1) of the DDA</LINK> came into effect on 15 February 2014, it was not permissible to invoke the presumption of "possession" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> to further invoke the presumption of "trafficking" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK>: <i>Muhammed Hassan (supra)</i>. It was held in that case that the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> can only be invoked upon affirmative proof of possession and not by way of presumption upon presumption. In other words knowledge must be proved by affirmative evidence and not by invoking the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. The present appeal, being a case prior to the amendment, is still subject to this pronouncement of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The question is whether the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> ceases to operate and becomes a dead letter of the law once the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> is invoked. This is an important question as it relates to the fundamental question of burden of proof. If the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> applies alongside the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK>, the burden on the appellant would be to rebut both presumptions on the balance of probabilities and not merely to cast a reasonable doubt on the facts presumed, ie firstly that he had knowledge of the drug and secondly that the drug was for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> If the appellant had succeeded in rebutting the presumption of "trafficking" he would of course have been acquitted of the offence charged, which is trafficking. But even if he did, he still had to rebut the presumption of knowledge failing which he would be convicted of the lesser offence of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">12(2)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39A.;;">s 39A(2) of the DDA</LINK> because failure to do so would mean that he was in possession of the drug, short of trafficking. The appellant would only be entitled to a total acquittal if he succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Having regard to the legislative scheme of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37 of the DDA</LINK> we are of the view that the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> continues to operate against the accused person even where the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> operates against him. This does not offend the rule against double presumption because the question of invoking the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> to further invoke the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> does not arise at all. Trafficking is presumed because the accused was found in "possession" of the drug whilst knowledge is presumed because he was found in custody or control of the drug.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Thus the factual elements that trigger the activations of these two presumptions are entirely different. Trafficking is presumed from "possession" whereas knowledge is presumed from custody or control. To our mind the position is this: If there is affirmative evidence to prove "possession" independent of the presumption under s 37(d), trafficking is presumed. If there is no such evidence of "possession" but nevertheless custody or control has been established, trafficking is not presumed but knowledge is by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. In that situation trafficking can still be proved by some other affirmative evidence without relying on the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK>: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_319;"><i>PP v. Abdul Manaf Muhamad Hassan</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 319</LINK>; [2006] 3 MLJ 193; [2006] 2 CLJ 129; [2006] 4 AMR 477.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the present case, despite bearing the burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK>, being in possession of more than the minimum weight prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(xvi) of the DDA</LINK>, the appellant chose not to discharge that burden. Not a shred of evidence was adduced by the appellant to show that the drug was not for the purpose of trafficking, as was done by the appellant in the Supreme Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_124;"><i>Cohen Lorraine Philis &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 124</LINK>; [1989] 3 MLJ 289; [1989] 1 CLJ 18.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> What the appellant did in this case was to sidestep his burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking by raising a defence of "no knowledge", which did not go towards proving that the drug was not for the purpose of trafficking. The presumption of trafficking therefore remained unrebutted. The question that remains to be considered is whether he had discharged his burden of rebutting the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> For all intents and purposes the defence of no knowledge raised by the appellant is a defence that he was not even in "possession" of the drug because without knowledge possession would only be physical possession, which is not an offence. It is a defence of total avoidance in the sense that if the appellant succeeded in proving, on the balance of probabilities that he had no knowledge of the drug (and therefore no possession), he would not even be liable to be convicted of the lesser offence of possession, custody or control under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39A.;;">s 39A(2) of the DDA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In Cohen Lorraine Philis (supra) the appellant admitted "possession" (meaning to say she admitted knowledge of the drug) but went on to produce proof that the drug was not for the purpose of trafficking, in rebuttal of the presumption of trafficking that applied against her. She failed in the High Court but succeeded in the Supreme Court whereby her conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B of the DDA</LINK> was set aside and substituted with a conviction for the lesser offence of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39A.;;">s 39A of the DDA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The Federal Court decision in Muhammed Hassan (supra) is authority for the proposition that the presumption of "possession" under the first part of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> cannot be used to further invoke the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK>. However this must not be understood to mean that where the presumption of trafficking is triggered by affirmative evidence of possession, the presumption of knowledge as to the nature of the drug, which falls under the second part of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> ceases to have effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We appreciate the appellant's right to decide on his line of defence, but by adopting the defence of "no knowledge", ie "no possession" rather than the defence of "no trafficking", he had completely failed to discharge his burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking, which clearly applied against him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Given the line of defence adopted by the appellant, the learned trial judge was not expected to make a finding that the drug was not for the purpose of trafficking for the simple reason that there was no material before the court for her to make such finding. What was before the learned trial judge was only the appellant's claim that he had no knowledge of the drug. It is axiomatic that the court acts on evidence laid before it and nothing else. Be that as it may the learned judge nevertheless proceeded to consider whether the presumption of trafficking had been rebutted and it was her finding that the appellant failed to rebut the presumption.</p>

      <b>[52]</b> The consequence of a failure to rebut a statutory presumption of fact which forms a necessary factual ingredient of the offence has been explained by Lord Diplock speaking for the Privy Council in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1968_1_606;"><i>PP v. Yuvaraj</i> [1968] 1 MLRA 606</LINK>; [1969] 1 MLJ 89 where he said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The pronouncement is clear. It is to the effect that if the accused succeeds in discharging his burden of proof, he will be acquitted of the offence charged but if he fails, he must be convicted. The case had been cited with approval by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1970_1_370;"><i>Ng Eng Kooi v. PP</i> [1970] 1 MLRA 370</LINK>; [1970] 1 MLJ 267 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337 and by the then Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_124;"><i>Cohen Lorraine Philis &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 124</LINK>; [1989] 3 MLJ 289; [1989] 1 CLJ 18 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_759;"><i>Ng Chai Kem lwn. PP</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 759</LINK>; [1994] 2 MLJ 210; [1994] 2 CLJ 593; [1994] 1 AMR 889. In the former case the Supreme Court recognised that the law on statutory presumptions as stated in Yuvaraj has become "part of our law". It may be argued that the passage quoted in bold above is obiter dictum (the issue in that case being quantum of proof) but the fact remains that the decision has crystallised into our law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In <i>Abdul Rahman Akif (supra)</i> the Federal Court in allowing the prosecution's appeal and reinstating the conviction and death sentence imposed by the High Court found that since the respondent did not offer any explanation whatsoever to rebut the presumption of trafficking, the presumption therefore stood unrebutted. This aligns with the principle laid down in Yuvaraj.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> We are of course mindful of the decision of the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311. We refer in particular to the following passages in the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> It is clear that the judgment of Suffian J (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1963_1_400;"><i>Mat v. PP</i> [1963] 1 MLRH 400</LINK>; [1982] 1b MLJ 13 was the guiding principle in the above decision. It also seems clear that the Supreme Court was speaking in terms of a case which had to be decided on the basis of the truth of the prosecution case as against the falsity of the defence story. But that is not the legal and factual matrix of the present case under appeal. What the court had to consider in the present appeal is whether the statutory presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">ss 37(d)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">37(da) of the DDA</LINK> applied and had been rebutted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> Indeed the Supreme Court in <i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob (supra)</i> recognised that the quantum of proof required to rebut a statutory presumption is proof on the balance of probabilities. <i>Mat v. PP</i>, it must be noted, does not involve any statutory presumption. It was a case of theft of two chickens and alternatively of dishonestly retaining a stolen chicken. Clearly the accused in that case had no duty to prove or to disprove anything, let alone a legal duty to rebut any statutory presumption. All that Mat had to do to earn an acquittal was merely to raise a reasonable doubt in the Magistrate's mind as to whether or not he stole the two chickens or dishonestly retaining one of the chickens. It is in this legal and factual context that Mohamad Radhi Yaakob must be understood.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Counsel's argument on the question of knowledge is that anybody could have left the drug in the drawer, particularly the appellant's friends or the hotel maid. According to counsel there is a real possibility that the drug was left behind by Hameed. To this argument we can only say "of course it is possible but not in the least probable" (to borrow the words of Lord Denning in <i>Miller v. Minister of Pensions</i> [1947] 2 All ER 372).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The "possibility" that counsel was speaking of must be tested against and in the light of the evidence that the appellant panicked when the search was in progress and in a state of shock and asking to be released when the drug was found. As alluded to earlier, this conduct is inconsistent with innocence. No plausible explanation was proffered by the appellant for behaving in this way other than to say that he was in shock because he realised by then that the plastic packet contained drug.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The appellant denied ever taking drugs but the unchallenged and uncontradicted evidence is that he tested positive for methamphetamine. It is not surprising therefore that the learned trial judge disbelieved his explanation. The explanation could not have been sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In dealing with the defence case the learned trial judge's approach was to determine whether the appellant's explanation had cast a reasonable doubt in her mind as to the truth of the prosecution case. In doing so she had duly drawn her attention to the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Having looked at the totality of the evidence, the learned trial judge concluded that the appellant's defence was "a fabrication concocted only at a late stage in his attempt to avoid culpability". On the evidence before her, the burden of proof and the probabilities of the case, we found nothing wrong with this conclusion to warrant our intervention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In the circumstances we dismissed the appellant's appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence.</p>

      <b>[64]</b> I have read the draft judgment of my learned brother Justice Abdul Rahman Sebli. I am on all fours with him except on the purport and application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK>, as set out in paras 38, 39 and 41 of the draft judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> Indeed, of particular interest is His Lordship's proposition that once a positive finding of custody or control has been established, then the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the said drugs must be invoked against the accused pursuant to the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> until the contrary is proved by the accused person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> At para 39 His Lordship alluded to the fact that since the trial judge's findings was that the drugs was in the appellant's possession at the time of his arrest, he must as a matter of common sense have had custody and control of the drugs as well. By operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>, he must be presumed to have had knowledge of the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> Whilst custody or control may be proved by direct evidence, knowledge, which is a mental element involving one's state of mind, undoubtedly is always difficult to prove by direct evidence in the absence of an express admission. However, it is trite that knowledge, though cannot be proved by direct evidence, it would be quite sufficient to prove facts from which it could be properly inferred that the accused knew or had the requisite knowledge that he had prohibited drugs in his custody or control as decided by a long line of cases - see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_143;"><i>Wong Nam Loi v. PP</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 143</LINK>; [1997] 3 MLJ 795; [1998] 1 CLJ 37; [1997] 4 AMR 3603; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_808;"><i>Emmanuel Yaw Teiku v. PP</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 808</LINK>; [2006] 5 MLJ 209; [2006] 3 CLJ 597; [2006] 4 AMR 753; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_565;"><i>Samundee Devan Muthu Kerishnan v. PP</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 565</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 607; [2010] 3 CLJ 269; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_204;"><i>PP v. Salleh Zakaria &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 204</LINK>; [2010] 4 MLJ 25; [2010] 4 CLJ 671; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337. These cases were all in similar vein, ie knowledge can be proved by inference from the surrounding facts and circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> I would hasten to add that this issue has been settled decades ago wherein Thomson J (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_44;"><i>Chan Pean Leon v. PP</i> [1956] 1 MLRH 44</LINK>; [1956] 1 MLJ 1 23, held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> More recently the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717, through Augustine Paul FCJ decided, at para 25 p 778:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The presumption afforded by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> is an additional weapon at the disposal of the prosecution to prove possession and knowledge. Presumptions are to aid the prosecution to prove its case or to fill a gap in the evidence as adverted by Thomson J in <i>Chan Pean Leon v. PP (supra)</i>. On account of the difficulty in proving knowledge by direct evidence and hence possession, the law allows the prosecution to resort to the aid of the said presumption. However, as seen from the authorities cited above, it does not and is not designed to ouster the prosecution's prerogative to prove its case (on possession and knowledge) by whatever means or in whatever manner it deems fit. Simply put the presumption does not preclude the prosecution from employing other means to prove knowledge of the nature of the said drugs on the part of the accused person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> It is to be noted that in the appeal herein the trial judge's finding was that the appellant had actual <i>mens rea</i> possession based on the evidence adduced that the drugs were found in a drawer together with the accused's personal belongings, including his passport, in a hotel room rented under the appellant's name to which he was given a key. Upon prove of the same (actual <i>mens rea</i> possession), she went on to invoked the statutory presumption of trafficking in the said drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(xvi) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> It is clear that the trial judge did not invoke the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to attribute possession and knowledge of the said drugs on the part of the appellant. She was entirely correct. She is under no compulsion to invoke the said presumption where the totality of the evidence adduced is sufficient to prove possession and knowledge from the surrounding facts and circumstances. The proposition that the presumption of knowledge under the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> must be invoked on account that the appellant have had custody and control and hence possession of the said drugs is only relevant and applicable where the trial judge choose to invoke the said presumption to attribute possession of the said drugs by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Thus acquiescence to His Lordship's proposition would have the consequential effect of imposing limitations upon the prosecution's options to choose which presumption to apply on account of the prohibition against double presumption (the position of the law prior to the coming into effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A of the Act</LINK> on 15 February 2014, allowing the application of double presumption). Needless to say, the presumption need not be applied where the evidence available is sufficient to prove knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Equally the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> is not an automatic mechanism compelling the court to invoke the presumption of possession and knowledge once custody or control has been established. I could do no better than regurgitate the statement of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_808;"><i>Emmanuel Yaw Teiku v. PP</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 808</LINK>; [2006] 5 MLJ 209; [2006] 3 CLJ 597; [2006] 4 AMR 753, which verily is on point:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> In my view <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_311;"><i>Muhammed Hassan v. PP</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 311</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 273; [1998] 2 CLJ 170; [1998] 1 AMR 829 is not the authority to compel the automatic application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> on account that where there is direct evidence to prove custody or control and knowledge of the drugs, the court may make a positive finding of possession independent of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>. The case merely prohibits the application of double presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">37(da) of the Act</LINK> and to arrive at the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> there should be a positive finding of actual possession of the drugs by the accused person by the trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> The ratio for the decision in <i>Muhammed Hassan (supra)</i> was explained by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_319;"><i>PP v. Abdul Manaf Muhamad Hassan</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 319</LINK>; [2006] 3 MLJ 193; [2006] 2 CLJ 129; [2006] 4 AMR 477, in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> Additionally, the Federal Court in <i>Emmanuel Yaw Teiku v. PP (supra)</i> stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> Hence it is not necessary upon the trial judge to invoke the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> where there is sufficient evidence of direct possession from which knowledge can be inferred from proved facts without resorting to the aid provided under the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>. The presumption under s<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;"> 37(d)</LINK> is only to enable the court to attribute knowledge where there is, under the circumstances, no direct evidence upon which an inference of knowledge can be drawn against the accused person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> It is also trite that the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> is two pronged. It covers both the presumption of possession and presumption of knowledge as possession without knowledge is not possession in the criminal sense of the definition as suggested by the long line of authorities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> The presumption of possession of the said drugs is in respect of any person who is found to have had in his custody or under his control anything whatsoever containing any dangerous drugs and not presumption of possession of any dangerous drugs found in the physical custody or control of the accused person. It would be completely absurd to mandatorily suggest the invocation of the presumption of possession over one who has been found to be in physical custody or control of the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> Hence it makes complete sense to have the presumption of knowledge of the nature of said drugs under the second limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> to run in tandem with the presumption of possession under the first limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> which was grounded solely upon proved custody or control of anything whatsoever containing dangerous drugs. Again, it is trite that mere custody or control without more is insufficient to attribute knowledge. The presumption of knowledge is thus a requisition to complete the mental element of possession as required under our criminal law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> As said earlier, in the appeal presently before us, the trial judge found that the appellant had actual <i>mens rea</i> possession and went on to find that once actual <i>mens rea</i> possession has been proved, the statutory presumption of trafficking in the said drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(xvi)</LINK> can be invoked as the amount of the said drugs was in excess of the statutory limit. Henceforth she ordered the appellant to enter his defence on the charge of trafficking in the said drugs. The decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_4_99;"><i>Siew Yoke Keong v. PP</i> [2013] 4 MLRA 99</LINK>; [2013] 3 MLJ 630; [2013] 4 CLJ 149; [2013] 3 AMR 202 is on point and clearly fortified the reading and application of the law as applied by the trial judge. At para 37, Ahmad Maarop FCJ stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In the upshot, the issue of the appellant herein having to carry the burden of rebutting the presumption of knowledge (and possession) under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> did not arise as the trial judge, based on the facts and evidence before her had correctly decided not to invoke the presumption of possession and knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>. In such event to earn an outright acquittal, there are two imperatives which must necessarily be embedded in the defence of the appellant, ie the burden to rebut, on the balance of probabilities, the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> as the said presumption was invoked and/or the evidential burden to raise a reasonable doubt in respect of possession (<i>mens rea</i>) of the said drugs which encompasses the elements of custody or control, knowledge and the power of disposal if the need arises. Hence, it follows through that the issue of breaching the rule against double presumption on account that the presumption of trafficking in the said drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> was invoked, is in fact a non-issue altogether.</p>
