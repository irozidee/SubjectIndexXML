    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant's appeal herein stemmed from the dismissal of its application for a stay of proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the Arbitration Act 2005 ('AA 2005')</LINK>, in respect of the respondent's action against the appellant for sums owing for the supply of building materials for a development project. The appellant argued that the respondent's claim should be determined by way of arbitration as the respondent's contract with the appellant was subject to the arbitration clause in the main contract between the appellant and the owners of the project, namely Hunza Properties (Penang) Sdn Bhd and Hunza Properties (Gurney) Sdn Bhd (collectively referred to herein as the 'employers'). The appellant's appointment as the main contractor of the project (pursuant to a Letter of Award granted by the employers and part of the main contract) was terminated following serious disputes between the said parties. The said parties had commenced arbitration proceedings. The appellant claimed that the respondent, the nominated supplier of building materials identified for the project as per cl 4 of the Letter of Award ('cl 4'), was also subject to the arbitration clause, ie Condition 34.1 of the main contract. Hence, the appellant's argument that the respondent's claim should be determined by way of arbitration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondent was not a signatory to the Letter of Award or any of the related papers that constituted the main contract between the employers and the appellant. The arbitration clause was found only in the conditions of contract between the employers and the appellant. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The intention behind cl 4 was to provide a safety net for the employers against price fluctuations in the market for the supply of building materials. The cost of such materials was to be pegged to the prices, provided that all supplies were procured from the supplier nominated by the employers. If the nominated supplier should increase such price, then the employers were to reimburse the appellant for any such increase. Conversely, if the appellant chose to procure the designated material from any other supplier, the employers would not be liable to bear any such increase in price of those materials. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was no statement or representation, expressly or by implication, in cl 4 which held out that the supply of the material by the respondent was as "agent" of the employers or that the supply arrangement pursuant to that clause would entail the respondent to be bound by the terms and conditions of the main contract. It was a matter of choice left up to the appellant whether or not to purchase the designated materials from the respondent in any case. To hold that the supply of the designated materials by the respondent as per the terms of cl 4, was part and parcel of the main contract, would therefore be stretching the words found in the language employed in cl 4 to unreasonable and unintended ends. The sale and supply arrangement with the respondent for the materials was a distinct and independent contract envisaged always to be separately entered into between the appellant and the respondent, if the appellant should choose to go that route. (paras 31-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was no direct arbitration agreement in writing between the appellant and the respondent as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9(3) of the AA 2005</LINK>. In the absence of such express written agreement between the appellant and the respondent, it was incumbent upon the appellant to establish on facts that such an agreement existed by "reference" to the adoption of Condition 34.1 of the main contract in so far as the supply of materials by the respondent was concerned. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The parties to the main contract and the nominated supply contract were not the same parties. Those two contracts were separate and distinct. The arbitration clause provided in Condition 34.1 of the main contract was restricted only to the differences and disputes between those parties specifically defined therein. Condition 34.1 did not state that the arbitration mode was also the agreed disputed resolution process for all disputes "in relation to" or "arising from" or "in connection with" the project in all cases. There was not shown any "record of agreement" on the part of the respondent that Condition 34.1 was also applicable in respect of the sale and supply of building materials. The appellant too did not make any reference to or stipulate in its Nomination Confirmation Letter confirming the respondent's nomination as supplier that Condition 34.1 was to bind the parties. Further, it was always open to the appellant whether to use the respondent as supplier of the materials in the first place (as per the terms of cl 4). (paras 36-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> As to the terms of payment by "contra of accounts" against monies due from the employers to the appellant, what was provided for was merely an agreed convenient mode for settlement of payment due to the respondent. It was not exclusive and did not in any manner delimit the "contra account" as the only mode of payment. Flowing from the separate and independent nature of the supply contract between the respondent and the appellant and, given further that there were no more payments from the employers to the appellant, the respondent had the right to pursue like any ordinary creditor to recover monies still owing to it from the appellant for the supplies delivered. (para 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> As regards the appellant's assertion that the same amount claimed in the suit had been included in the original arbitration proceedings between the employers and the appellant, the employers had now filed a revised Bundle of Documents that excluded the respondent's claim. The only complaint of the appellant was that the main pleadings in the arbitration itself had not been amended as yet to reflect the abandonment of that part of the originally included claim in the arbitration. Such original pleading was, in any event, subject to proof and in the circumstances of the revised Bundle of Documents that had been filed, that part of the claim was no longer a matter for determination in the arbitration. There was no cause for any concern in the circumstances that there arose a duplicity or multiplicity of proceedings, as was urged upon the court by the appellant as a further reason why the stay ought to be allowed. (paras 41-42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The appellant's argument that the respondent and the employers were related companies within the Hunza Group and so should be a ground to impose or extend the arbitration clause in Condition 34.1 of the main contract to apply to the respondent's transaction in respect of the project, would require the court to lift the "corporate veil" and to put aside the entrenched concept that incorporated companies were separate legal entities, with its own rights and liabilities. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> There was no convincing reason shown why corporate independence should be disregarded in this case. There was no assertion of any fraud by the appellant such as any impropriety committed by the respondent at the behest of the employers (even if there was evidence of direct ownership or control by the employers - which it was contended was not the case here) or that the supply of the identified materials separately was an "abuse" by the employers to conceal some wrongdoing. (para 44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> The answer to the question of whether the filing by the appellant of the application to strike out the whole suit after the application for stay was dismissed but before the notice of appeal against the latter was filed, was a step in proceedings acceding to the jurisdiction of the court, lay within the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the AA 2005</LINK> itself. It was clear from that provision that for a stay to be considered by the court, the party applying had to file for the same before taking any other step in the subject proceedings itself. The application for stay by the appellant had been filed first in time and the application to strike out was a subsequent application. Therefore the appellant was not disentitled of its right to seek a stay or to pursue with this appeal against the dismissal of the prior application for stay before the court. The appellant had not abandoned its application for stay under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1) of the AA 2005</LINK> nor was this appeal rendered academic.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal was against the decision of the High Court which had dismissed an application for stay of proceedings. The appellant/defendant had sought the stay pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the Arbitration Act 2005 (AA 2005)</LINK> and for the respondent/plaintiff 's claims in the action to be referred to arbitration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We had dismissed the appeal unanimously and now set down our reasons for doing so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondent/plaintiff (Hunza Trading) was a trading company who supplied certain designated building materials for a project known as 'The Basement Construction for the Proposed Mixed Development on Lots 39, 296, 1237, 1238, 2347, 2348 and 23450, Section 1, Persiaran Gurney, Bandar Georgetown, Pulau Pinang (the project). The owners of the project were Hunza Properties (Penang) Sdn Bhd and Hunza Properties (Gurney) Sdn Bhd (collectively, the employers).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant/defendant (PLB-KH Bina) was the main contractor engaged by the employers to undertake the project under the terms of a Letter of Award dated 14 January 2008 (Letter of Award) for a total contract sum of RM30.408 million.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Clause 4 of the Letter of Award provided as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> PLB-KH Bina by a letter of 30 April 2008 to Hunza Trading confirmed that the employers had appointed Hunza Trading as the employers' nominee for the supply of the identified building material for the Project (Nomination Confirmation Letter). The material parts of the letter read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Letter of Award and the Articles of Agreement and Condition of Building Contract (between Employers and PLB-KH Bina) contained an arbitration clause.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Hunza Trading had proceeded to supply the identified building material from 31 March 2008 to 15 May 2009 for the project. Pursuant to the statement in the Nomination Confirmation Letter that payment for the material supplied by Hunza Trading would be way of 'contra of accounts' (as against periodic progress payments due from the employers to PLB-KH Bina) a total of 30 debit notes had been issued by Hunza Trading directly to the employers and had been paid for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In May 2009 there arose serious disputes as between the employers and PLB-KH Bina as to the amounts owing and payable to the latter and no further progress claims were certified by the architect. PLB-KH Bina's appointment as the main contractor was subsequently terminated on 26 August 2009 by the employers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The employers and PLB-KH Bina thereafter commenced arbitration proceedings (in 2010) and have referred disputes as have arisen between them for determination through that dispute resolution process (the Arbitration).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 20 December 2012 Hunza Trading through their solicitors demanded from PLB-KH Bina settlement of the sum of RM587,128.61, allegedly the sums still outstanding and owing by PLB-KH Bina for the delivery of the identified building materials for the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> This suit was filed on 7 January 2013 when the demand to pay was not met. On 30 January 2013 PLB-KH Bina filed the subject application for stay pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of AA 2005</LINK> relying principally on the ground that by virtue of cl 4 of the Letter of Award read together with the terms of the Nomination Confirmation Letter, Hunza Trading's claim had to be determined by way of arbitration proceeding as well rather than through the courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Hunza Trading had also at the High Court filed an application for summary judgment on 15 February 2013. PLB-KH Bina had subsequent to the dismissal of their stay application (17 July 2013) filed an application on 23 July 2013 to strike out Hunza Trading's action; the notice of appeal against decision of the High Court, subject of this appeal was only filed on 12 August 2013. All the above interlocutory proceedings referred to in this paragraph have since been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> However Hunza Trading contended that the application to strike out the action filed by PLB-KH Bina was a fresh step in the proceedings and it ought therefore to be construed as an intention to submit to the jurisdiction of the court to proceed with the suit rather than have the dispute referred to arbitration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellant's Contentions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> PLB-KH Bina's argument before us was primarily that by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9</LINK> in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9(4)(b) of the AA 2005</LINK>, there was an arbitration agreement between Hunza Trading and PLB-KH Bina to refer all disputes to be resolved by arbitration. It was contended that the arbitration clause in the main contract between the employers and PLB-KH Bina extended to include Hunza Trading, who it was further argued, in the circumstances of the relationship obtaining between the parties was an 'agent' of the employers at all material times.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was submitted that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>offered clear proof that it was always intended that any dispute related to payments to Hunza Trading would also be arbitrated rather than litigated in the courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> PLB-KH Bina also wanted the court to take note that Hunza Trading (although a separate company) was a related company in the Hunza Group of Companies (of which the employers were part) and hence the supply of the designated material by this nominated supplier for the project was an internal arrangement of the employers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was also argued that since Hunza Trading had been acknowledged by the employers as their 'nominee' supplier (Nomination Confirmation Letter - 30 April 2008), there was not in existence any separate contractual relationship between PLB-KH Bina and Hunza Trading in any event, and the operative contract was only that as between PLB-KH Bina and the employers, (ie the main construction contract).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Respondent's Contention</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Hunza Trading on the other hand maintained that the main contract (employers and PLB-KH- Bina) and the Nomination Confirmation Letter - 30 April 2008 evidenced two separate and distinct contractual arrangements. They had to be treated on a stand-alone basis, the latter being an independent sale/supply contract directly between Hunza Trading and PLB-KH Bina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It was also argued that the fact that a mode of payment was provided for (namely by contra payment), as set out in the Nomination Confirmation Letter - 30 April 2008) did not <i>ipso facto</i> make the supply agreement part of the main construction contract. The raising of debit notes and the deductions from progress payments effected by the employers had to be considered in that context and restricted in scope to merely an arrangement to facilitate payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It was further submitted that since there had since arisen dispute between the employers and PLB-KH Bina over payments (and the dispute had since been referred to arbitration), whatever 'contra accounts' envisaged could not be given further effect. It was highlighted to us that there was no express limitation or restriction placed on Hunza Trading in the terms of cl 4 of the Letter of Award or the Nomination Confirmation Letter from bringing a claim directly against PLB-KH Bina for recovery of sum still due and outstanding to Hunza Trading as the nominated supplier of the material.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It was stressed that Hunza Trading was not a party or signatory to the main contract (where the Arbitration Clause was found) and that Hunza Trading had not agreed anywhere to refer all and any dispute arising, in so far as the supply of designated materials was concerned, to be determined by only arbitration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It was argued also that Hunza Trading was an independent corporate entity (although within the Hunza Group) and no acceptable grounds to go beyond or to lift the corporate veil had been made out or adduced by PLB-KH Bina in this instance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> As regards the inclusion of the similar sum as part of the employers' claim in the Arbitration, it was submitted for Hunza Trading that although this did appear in the original pleading and was comprised in documents initially adduced during discovery by the employer, this item of claim has since be excluded (and the pleadings was in the process of being amended); the claim which was the subject of this suit no longer formed therefore part of the employers' claims in the arbitration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It was not in dispute that Hunza Trading was not a signatory to the Letter of Award or any of the related papers that constituted the main contract between the employers and PLB-KH Bina. The arbitration clause in the following terms was found as Condition 34.1 in the Conditions of Contract only:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(Discussed further at para 36 of this judgment).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Counsel for PLB-KH Bina's submissions, as we could perceive it, was two prongs, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9(3) and 9(4) of AA 2005</LINK> were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For completeness, it was also necessary to have reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9(5) of AA 2005</LINK> which was in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The question then that was before us was whether cl 4 of the Letter of Award (set out at para 5 above) by itself or when read together with the material contents of the Nomination Confirmation Letter of 30 April 2008 (set out at para 6 above) had the effect of binding Hunza Trading to an obligatory arbitration process:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In our assessment upon a careful reading of cl 4 of the Letter of Award it was clear that the intention behind that provision was to provide a safety net for the employers against price fluctuation in the market for 'supply of concrete and steel reinforcement bars'. The cost of such material was to be pegged to the prices (listed in Appendix B) provided all supplies were procured from the supplier nominated by the employers. Further if the nominated supplier should increase such price, then in such event the employers were to reimburse PLBKH Bina for any such increase. Conversely, it therefore meant that if PLB-KH Bina chose however to procure the designated material from any other supplier, the employers would not be liable to bear any such increase in price of those materials. This in our view was the net effect of cl 4 of the Letter of Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> It should also be noted that nowhere in cl 4 was there any statement or representation, expressly or by implication, which held out that supply of the material by Hunza Trading was as 'agent' of the employers or that the supply arrangement pursuant to that clause would entail Hunza Trading to be bound to the terms and condition of the main contract. It must be stressed that it was a matter of choice left up to PLB-KH Bina whether or not to purchase the designated material from Hunza Trading in any case.</p>
    <p>Of significance was the following words in cl 4, which bore this out clearly:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In our view, to hold that the supply of the designated material by Hunza Trading as per the terms of cl 4, was part and parcel of the main contract, would therefore be stretching the words found in the language employed in cl 4 to unreasonable and definitely unintended ends. We agreed with counsel for the Hunza Trading that the sale and supply arrangement with Hunza Trading for concrete and steel bars was a distinct and independent contract envisaged always to be separately entered into between PLB-KH Bina and Hunza Trading, if PLB-KH Bina should choose to go that route.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It was an accepted fact that that there was no direct arbitration agreement in writing between PLB-KH Bina and Hunza Trading as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9(3) of AA 2005</LINK>.</p>
    <p>In the absence of such express written agreement between PLB-KH Bina and Hunza Trading, it was incumbent upon PLB-KH Bina to establish on facts that such an agreement existed by 'reference' for the adoption of Condition 34.1 in so far the supply of materials by Hunza Trading was concerned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">Section 9(3),(4) and (5) of AA 2005</LINK> has been considered by our courts in various recent cases. The Court of Appeal in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_155;"><i>Duta Wajar Sdn Bhd v. Pasukhas Construction Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 155</LINK>; [2012] 5 MLJ 27; [2012] 4 CLJ 844 (involving a similar application for stay as in this case) instructively noted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Court of Appeal there reversed the High Court decision (which allowed a stay on the grounds of 'conduct of the plaintiff') saying that the standard of proof to hold that an 'arbitration agreement in writing' existed had not been met in that case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> There was also a helpful excerpt from Gary Born's <i>International Commercial Arbitration</i> (vol 1) quoted in the judgment of the court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1540;"><i>KNM Process Systems Sdn Bhd v. Mission Biofuels Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] MLRHU 1540</LINK>; [2013] 1 CLJ 993. The High Court in that case allowed a stay under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 AA 2005</LINK> holding that the wording of an existent written arbitration clause should be given a wide construction where linking words like 'in connection with' or 'in relation to' are used. The relevant part of the judgment was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

      <b>[36]</b> We need to pause here and note that in the appeal before us, the parties to the main contract (Employer and PLB-KH Bina) and the nominated supply contract (PLB-KH Bina and Hunza Trading) were not the same parties and those two contracts were separate and distinct as discussed above. The Arbitration Clause was set out in the conditions to the main contract and as provided in Condition 34.1 (see para 25 above) the envisaged dispute or difference which had been agreed to be arbitrated was expressly those that '... arise(s) between the employer, or the architect on his behalf, and the contractor ...' It was restricted only to the differences and disputes between those parties more specifically further defined therein.</p>
    <p>Condition 34.1 did not state that the arbitration mode was also the agreed disputed resolution process for all disputes 'in relation to' or 'arising from' or 'in connection' with the project in all cases (unlike in <i>KNM Process System (supra)</i> and in <i>Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corp &amp; Ors v. Privalor &amp; Ors</i> [2007] 4 All ER 951).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_5_85;"><i>Ajwa For Food Industries Co (MIGOP), Egypt v. Pacific Inter-Link Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] 5 MLRA 85</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 625; [2013] 7 CLJ 18; [2013] 4 AMR 789, the Federal Court speaking through Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin (CJM) stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b>
      <i>Ajwa For Food</i> was a case which involved an application to set aside an Arbitral Award. The matter in contention there revolved around the fact that the Sales Contract did not set out any 'arbitration clause' whilst the Standard Terms and Condition (STC) (separately issued) contained an arbitration clause. It was held there that the intention of the parties had always been for the sales contracts to be subject to the STC and accordingly the arbitration clause was held to be binding (although unsigned) and by reference had become part of the contract between the same parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> However that was not the case in the instant appeal before us. Firstly, there was not shown to us any 'record of agreement' on the part of Hunza Trading that Condition 34.1 was also applicable in respect of the sale and supply of building arrangement. Secondly, PLB-KH Bina themselves, who were the issuers of the Nomination Confirmation Letter, did not make any reference to or stipulate therein that Condition 34.1 was to bind the parties. One could not in this respect disregard the overriding facts that it was always open to PLB-KH Bina whether to use Hunza Trading as supplier of those material or not in the first place (as per the terms of cl 4 of the Letter of Award) and further that the parties were not similar in the two contracts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Returning then to the terms as to payment by 'contra of accounts' against monies due from the employers to PLB-KH Bina, it was our considered view, what was provided for was merely an agreed convenient mode for settlement of payment due to Hunza Trading. It was not exclusive and did not in whatsoever manner, it must be noted, delimit the 'contra account' as the only mode of payment. We found merit in the contention of Counsel for Hunza Trading that flowing from the separate and independent nature of the supply contract between Hunza Trading and PLB-KH Bina and, given further that there was no more payments from the employers to PLB-KH Bina after May 2009, Hunza Trading had the right to pursue like any ordinary creditor to recover monies still owing to them from PLB-KH Bina for the supplies delivered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> As regards PLB-KH Bina's assertion that the same amount claimed in the suit had been included in the original arbitration proceedings between the employers and PLB-KH Bina, it needs to be pointed out that counsel for the latter did not dispute that the employers have now filed a revised Bundle of Documents titled 'Claimant's Bundle of Documents Category R vol 1 to IV' which set out what is stated to be 'Statement of Claim (Rev 1)' in the arbitration proceedings and this did not now include Hunza Trading's claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> This corroborated the submission of counsel for Hunza Trading. The only complaint of PLB-KH Bina, as it would appear then, was that the main pleadings in the arbitration itself had not be amended as yet to reflect the abandonment of that part of the originally included claim in the Arbitration. We accept the contention of counsel for Hunza Trading that such original pleading was however in any event subject to proof and in the circumstances of the revised Bundle of Documents that had been filed, that part of the claim was no longer a matter for determination in the arbitration. There was no cause for any concern in the circumstances that there arose a duplicity or multiplicity of proceedings, as was urged upon us by counsel for PLB-KH Bina as a further reason why the stay ought to be allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> PLB-KH Bina's one further argument was that Hunza Trading and the employers were related companies within the Hunza Group and this should be a ground to impose or extend the 'arbitration clause' (Condition 34.1) to apply to Hunza Trading's transaction in respect of the project. In effect what was being contended here was that the court ought to in the circumstances lift the 'corporate veil' and to put aside the entrenched concept that incorporated companies are separate legal entities, with their own rights and liabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We agreed with counsel for Hunza Trading that there was no convincing reason shown why corporate independence should be disregarded in this case. There was no assertion of any fraud by PLB-KH Bina such as any impropriety committed by Hunza Trading at the behest of the employers (even if there was evidence of direct ownership or control by the employers - which it was contended was not the case here) or that the supply of the identified materials separately was an 'abuse' by the employers to conceal some wrongdoing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Now as for the submission of counsel for Hunza Trading on the other hand that the filing by PLB-KH Bina of the application to strike out the whole suit (filed on 23 July 2013 after the application for stay was dismissed but before the notice of appeal against the latter was filed) ought to be construed as a step in a proceeding acceding to the jurisdiction of the court, we were of the view that the answer to that contention lay within the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 AA 2005</LINK> itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">Section 10(1) of AA 2005</LINK> was in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> It was clear from that provision that for a stay to be considered by the court, the party applying had to file for the same before taking any other step in the subject proceedings itself. The application for stay here by PLB-KH Bina had been filed first in time and the application to strike out was a subsequent application. In our view therefore PLB-KH Bina's was therefore not disentitled of their right to seek a stay or to pursue with this appeal against the dismissal of the prior application for stay before the court. We could not agree with counsel for Hunza Trading, therefore, that PLB-KH Bina had abandoned their application for stay under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10(1) AA 2005</LINK> or that this appeal had been rendered academic now.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> It was trite that arbitration was always a consensual process, depending upon the intentions of the parties either expressly in writing or by virtue now of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;9.;;">s 9(4) and (5) of the AA 2005</LINK>. As shown by us, the main contract between the employers and PLB-KH Bina was distinct and separate from the optional contract for supply of concrete and steel bars that PLB-KH Bina could chose to procure from Hunza Trading.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The condition to the main contract contained the arbitration clause was obligatory only on the parties to that main contract to refer the differences and disputes as further defined in that clause (Condition 34.1) for resolution by the arbitration process. The arbitration clause did not extend by 'reference' to Hunza Trading at all in respect of the sale and supply of the building materials transactions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> On those principal grounds and for the other reasons discussed and elaborated above, it was our decision that learned judge at the High Court was correct in refusing the stay applied for by PLB-KH Bina. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal.</p>
