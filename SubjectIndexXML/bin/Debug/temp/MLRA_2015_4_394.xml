    <p>The respondent/plaintiff was convicted and sentenced to a fine of RM150,000 in default of six months' imprisonment on each of two charges under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1983_280;41.;;">s 41(2) of the Securities Industry Act 1983 ("the Act")</LINK>. He thus faced a total fie of RM300,000. The plaintiff only paid a sum of RM220,000. He had paid fully for one charge but only paid half for the second charge. A warrant of committal was issued against the plaintiff stipulating that if RM150,000 was not paid, he would face six months' imprisonment. The plaintiff failed to object or produce receipts of payment on the day of imprisonment. During his detention in prison, the plaintiff alleged that he had informed the prison authorities of the error on the warrant of committal, but the authorities had ignored him. The plaintiff alleged that because of the negligence of the prison authorities, he was detained for an extra 74 days. He thus claimed damages for wrongful imprisonment in respect of those 74 days. The High Court found the appellants/defendants liable and allowed the plaintiff's action, awarding the plaintiff exemplary damages. The defendants appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the defendants' appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The judgment did not pass the acid test of reasonableness. The Court of Appeal may affirm a decision of the High Court as correct even though the grounds of judgment may not be satisfactory in cases when the decision passes the acid test of reasonableness, due to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;69.;;">s 69 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. (para 9(i)-(ii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the trial judge had failed to consider <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1995_537;29.;;">s 29 of the Prison Act 1995</LINK>. The warrant had the force of law and needed to be followed. (paras 10-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Exemplary damages are granted only in extreme cases where authorities wrongfully and with knowledge breach their obligations under the law and the act is inimical to fundamental guarantees enshrined in the Federal Constitution. It is not awarded for negligent acts or tortious conduct <i>per se</i>. In the instant case, this was not a fi and proper case to consider exemplary damages. (paras 17-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> No man can take advantage of his negligence or wrong doing or omission based on the legal maxim "<i>nullus commodum capere potese de inuria sua propri</i>". This maxim is made applicable in various instances and not only confined to contractual principles as the maxim relates to common sense. In the instant case, the evidence showed that the plaintiff had already paid RM220,000 as early as 4 February 2008 and the warrant of committal was only issued on 4 August 2009. Upon seeing the warrant the plaintiff should have objected to the right channel with evidence, but he did not do so. On the facts of the case, the trial judge ought not to have found in favour of the plaintiff. (para 19)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants'/defendants' appeal in respect of damages awarded for wrongful imprisonment of the respondent/plaintiff came up for hearing on 8 May 2014 and upon hearing we allowed the appeal. My learned brother Azahar Mohamed JCA and my learned sister Aziah Ali JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It must be noted that the cross-appeal was withdrawn with the consent of the parties on the date of hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminaries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> A common sense approach needs to be applied to understand the case in the right perspective. Evidence will show the plaintiff/respondent was himself negligent and did not show receipt of payment of fie for which he was imprisoned notwithstanding that he was represented by solicitors as well as his family members having visited him regularly in the prison. The elementary jurisprudence involved in the instant case relates to 'no man can take advantage of his wrong or mistake or negligence, etc'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff was found guilty, convicted and sentenced to a fie of RM150,000.00 in default, six months' imprisonment in respect of two charges under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1983_280;41.;;">s 41(2) of the Securities Industry Act 1983</LINK>. That is to say he must pay a fie of RM300,000.00. He had paid RM220,000.00 and in consequence of not paying the balance, a warrant of committal was issued against the plaintiff stipulating RM150,000.00 if not paid, in default of six months imprisonment. That is to say for one charge he has paid in full and the other charge he has paid partly but the warrant says RM150,000.00. The plaintiff could have objected and produced the receipts of payment on the day of arrest and imprisonment and/or could have done so through his solicitors. The fact that he has to serve imprisonment for not having paid the balance RM80,000.00 is not in dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The plaintiff's complaint is that he has orally informed the Kajang Prison and later the Bentong Prison where he was detained but the prison authorities had ignored him. One need to pause here - the warrant of committal was issued by the court and if it was erroneous he ought to have informed the court and corrected the same. The prison authorities were purely acting on the warrant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The plaintiff says that because of the negligence of the prison authorities he was detained for extra 74 days and claims the portion of the days spent as wrongful imprisonment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned trial judge indeed found as a fact that he had orally informed the prison authorities and found the defendants liable without explaining how that could have been under the law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellants' memorandum of appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We have read the Appeal Record and thank the counsel for the comprehensive submission. After much consideration to the submission of the learned counsel for the plaintiff/respondent and the defendants/appellants in this appeal, we take the view the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the instant case, the learned trial judge had failed to consider <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1995_537;29.;;">s 29 of Prison Act 1995</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is trite warrant issued by the court has a force of law and need to be followed. This point was well articulated in the case of <i>McGarth v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Another</i> [2001] 4 All ER 334, where the court relying on the House of Lords decision of <i>Henderson v. Preston</i> [1888] 21 QBD 362 observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And further down in the judgment it was stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Quite recently the Court of Appeal in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_4_381;"><i>Ketua Polis Daerah Johor Bahru, Johor &amp; Ors v. Ngui Tek Choi</i> [2013] 4 MLRA 381</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 504; [2013] 4 CLJ 47; [2013] 3 AMR 235, relying on the case of '<i>McGarth</i>' in respect of remand order had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In <i>Olotu v. Home Office</i> [1997] 1 All ER 385 on a similar subject, the court observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And the court also endorsed the argument that there was no duty on the detaining authority to rectify the warrant and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In <i>R v. Governor of Brockhill Prison ex parte Evans (No 2)</i> [2004] 4 All ER 15, the court observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In <i>Quinland v. Governor of Swaleside Prison and Others</i> [2003] 1 All ER 1173, the English Court of Appeal had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2013_1275;"><i>Mohd Khirudin Yaakub v. Superintendant Of Central Prison Kuching &amp; Ors</i> [2013] MLRHU 1275</LINK>; [2013] 7 CLJ 654, the court had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In this case, the court has granted exemplary damages. Exemplary damages are granted only in extreme cases where authorities wrongfully and with knowledge breach their obligations under the law and the act is inimical to fundamental guarantees enshrined in the Federal Constitution. It is not ordered for negligent act or tortious conduct <i>per se</i>. This area of jurisprudence has been explored in detail by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_6_531;"><i>Nurasmira Maulat Abd Jaffar &amp; Ors v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 6 MLRA 531</LINK>; [2015] 2 CLJ 231 and the court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Based on established principles this is not a fit and proper case even to consider exemplary damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> It is also well established that no man can take advantage of his negligence or wrongdoing or omission, etc based on the legal maxim '<i>nullus commodum capere potese de inuria sua propri</i>'. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_199;"><i>Gimstern Corp (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Global Insurance Co Sdn Bhd</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 199</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 302; [1987] CLJ 102]. This maxim is made applicable in various instances and not only confined to contractual principles as the maxim relates to common sense. In the instant case, the evidence will show that the plaintiff had already paid RM220,000.00 as early as 4 February 2008 and warrant of committal was only issued on 4 August 2009. Upon seeing the warrant he should have objected to the right channel with evidence but he did not do so. On the facts of the case, the learned trial judge ought not to have found in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> For reasons stated above we are of the considered view that it is fi and proper case to allow the appeal with costs of RM5,000.00. The order of the High Court is set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We hereby ordered so.</p>
