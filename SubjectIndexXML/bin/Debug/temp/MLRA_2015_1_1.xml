    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant company herein, Maxis Communications Berhad ('Maxis'), granted options to its eligible employees under an Employees Share Option Scheme ('ESOS') to subscribe for shares in the company. The eligible employee who accepted the offer signed an acceptance form called a "Share Option Agreement" which specified the number of shares accepted, the price per share, the total amount payable and payment of RM1 resulting in a binding contract. The options would vest one-third on each anniversary (over a three-year period) from the date of the offer, and an eligible employee could exercise the option up to ten years from the date of the first grant. Subsequently, a company called Binariang GSM Sdn Bhd ('Binariang') acquired all voting shares in Maxis for a cash consideration under a conditional takeover. The Board of Directors of Maxis invoked cl 10 of the ESOS Bye-laws whereby the holders of the unvested options were entitled to payment of Equivalent Cash Consideration ('ECC'). The respondents herein, the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia ('IRB'), held that the ECC payment to Maxis' employees was a "perquisite" employment income taxable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1967 ('the Act')</LINK> and assessable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1) of the Act</LINK>. Maxis contended that it was a share based employment income assessable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK>. The High Court decided in favour of Maxis, finding that the ECC was taxable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> but the tax payable was to be assessed pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK>. The IRB appealed to the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal. The High Court decision was set aside and the ruling by IRB was affirmed. Hence, Maxis appealed before the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The ECC, being a cash payment, was an employment income under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. The ECC constituted a "perquisite" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a)</LINK>. The basis for taxation of an employment income was provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1) of the Act</LINK> in which the employment income was taxed in the year an employee received such income. (paras 16-17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was no definition of the word "perquisite" under the Act. Based on <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i>, "perquisite" meant "a privilege or benefit given in addition to one's salary or regular wages". In the present case, the employees of Maxis were offered shares at a discounted price, ie lower than the market value of the shares. That was a benefit amounting to a "perquisite" under the Act. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1A)</LINK>, the perquisite was taxed in the year the employee exercised the right to purchase the shares. The mechanism to tax the perquisite was under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">s 32(1A)</LINK> where the difference between the offer price and the lower market value of the shares on the date of offer was taxed. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The ECC was a cash payment in substitution of the unvested options under ESOS. The ESOS was cancelled following Binariang's conditional takeover of Maxis. Both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> were not applicable to determine the taxability of the ECC payment. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">Section 25(1A)</LINK> provided for taxability of gross income from an employment in respect of any right to acquire shares. The application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1A)</LINK> must be read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">s 32(1A)</LINK> which provided for the computation of the value of shares. Upon a plain reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1A)</LINK>, a right to acquire shares must exist and the employee must own the shares under his name. If the right to acquire the shares existed, the date when that right was exercised or released must be taken into account. When Maxis was taken over by Binariang, there were no shares to be offered to the employee thereafter. The date of the grant was not the date where the employees acquired the right over the shares. The option was only vested on the employee, one third of each anniversary and the employee must exercise the right on or after the anniversary date under the ESOS Bye-laws. (paras 20-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The payment of the ECC was not based on the ESOS. For the employee to be entitled for the shares under ESOS, they must purchase the shares. The payment based on the "adjusted offer price less option price" was only a mechanism for making the payment but did not reflect the ESOS. Since the Maxis tax consultant confirmed that Maxis was delisted from the main board of Bursa Malaysia, no listed share price could be attached to the shares. By that admission, the cash payment was not an ESOS. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> There was no ambiguity as regards to the interpretation of the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> which in its ordinary meaning meant that they were applicable to employment income (perquisite) in respect of any right to acquire shares and provide the mechanism to compute the value of shares/ perquisite. The words used and the intention of Parliament was clearly shown in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> in that the provisions applied to shares and not to cash payment or the ECC. Even if the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;15.;;">ss 15</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A)</LINK> were not clear and might include the payment of the ECC or cash payment, then the purposive approach to interpretation should be adopted (<i>Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia v. Alam Maritim Sdn Bhd</i>). Useful reference could also be made to the Finance Bill 2005 to ascertain Parliament's intention when enacting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A)</LINK>. The explanatory statement thereof showed that the provisions were introduced to clarify the tax treatment on income from employment on any right to acquire shares in a company. It made clear that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A)</LINK> did not apply to a benefit or perquisite received by an employee by way of cash payment. (paras 25-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The RM1 payment made by the employee merely indicated the employee's acceptance of the offer. It did not give the employee the right to acquire the shares as yet. The employees were only eligible to purchase the shares on the anniversary date in order to be the rightful owner of the shares. The employee could not maintain the offer to purchase the shares by reason of the takeover as Maxis was delisted. There were no longer any shares to be offered. The employee did not have any right to purchase the shares before the anniversary date as the shares had yet to be vested in the employee. It followed that an employee who had an unvested option in ESOS did not have a right to acquire the shares before the anniversary date. Therefore, the cash benefit received was not taxed in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK>, but was instead taxable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1) of the Act</LINK>.

      <b>Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin CJM:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant, Maxis Communications Berhad against the whole decision of the Court of Appeal in allowing the respondents' appeal against the decision of the High Court. The Court of Appeal set aside the order of the High Court and affirmed the ruling made by the respondents dated 10 October 2008 in relation to tax liable to be paid by the employees of the appellant on payment received under the appellant's employee share option scheme. We shall hereinafter refer to the appellant as Maxis and to the respondents as the Revenue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Leave To Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Leave to appeal was granted by this court on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The relevant background facts of the case are these. Maxis launched ESOS when it was listed on Bursa Malaysia. By this ESOS eligible employees were granted options to subscribe for shares in Maxis through ESOS. The options were granted by way of a letter of offer from Maxis to an eligible employee. Upon receipt of the letter of offer, an eligible employee would decide whether to accept the offer or not. If the eligible employee accepted the offer, he or she would sign an acceptance form referred to as the "Share Option Agreement".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The signed acceptance form specified the number of shares accepted, the price per share, the total amount payable and payment of RM1.00 resulting in a binding contract. The options vest one-third (⅓) on each anniversary (over a three year period) from the date of the offer. An eligible employee can exercise the option up to 10 years from the date of the first grant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On May 2007 Binariang GSM Sdn Bhd ["Binariang"] served a Notice of Conditional Take-over on the Board of Directors of Maxis. On 24 May 2007 Binariang made a Conditional Take-over to acquire all voting shares in Maxis for a cash consideration. By reason of the Take-over and the request of Binariang the Board of Directors of Maxis invoked cl 10 of the ESOS Byelaws where the holders of the unvested option were entitled to a payment of Equivalent Cash Consideration (ECC) in accordance with the vesting schedule of such unvested option. Under the ECC, the employees receive an alternative consideration in substitution or in cancellation of all outstanding unvested options. The cash amount would only be paid to them in tranches according to the original vesting schedule applicable to the outstanding options.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The issue to be decided in this case involves the question of how eligible employees were to be assessed for tax for cancellation of all outstanding unvested option in return for the payment of the ECC. The Revenue in a ruling dated 10 October 2008 took the position that the payment of ECC to Maxis' employees as perquisite arising from employment under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> and not as share based income as contended by Maxis which would be taxable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The High Court decided in favour of Maxis and ruled that the ECC was taxable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> but the value of tax payable was to be assessed pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK>. The High Court in its decision amongst others made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by the Revenue against the decision of the High Court. The order of the High Court was set aside and the ruling by the Revenue dated 10 October 2008 was affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Court of Appeal in its judgment inter alia made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions Of The Appellant [Maxis]</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Learned counsel for Maxis submitted that the High Court had correctly held that the fact that the options under the Share Option Agreement had not yet vested was not relevant. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">Sections 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> do not differentiate between vested options and unvested options. An eligible employee therefore has a valid and enforceable contractual right under the scheme despite the fact that his option only vests on an annual basis over a three year period.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was contended for Maxis the fact is that all eligible employees gave good and valid consideration for the contract and in return for that consideration, the employee acquired the right to participate in the scheme. The takeover by Binariang did not absolve Maxis from complying with its contractual obligations with the eligible employees. Maxis therefore resorted to Byelaw 10.1 of the Byelaws of the ESOS and paid an equivalent consideration, that is, the ECC to absolve itself from its obligation under the ESOS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It was submitted for Maxis in an ESOS, the taxable benefit to the recipient is the right to acquire shares in a company. This is clear from the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">s 32(1A) of the Act</LINK>. Learned counsel for Maxis further impressed upon us that such a treatment is also in accordance with the English position that a taxable benefit arises when a right to acquire shares is granted to the employee. [See <i>Abbott v. Philbin</i> [1961] AC 352 and <i>Williamson v. Dalton</i> [1981] STC 753].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was further submitted for Maxis that until 2006 which was the year when <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">s 32(1A)</LINK> were introduced the Act did not contain specific provisions for the taxation of share-based income. Instead, reliance was placed largely on principles of taxation established in English case law and the Inland Revenue Board's Public Ruling No 4/2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On the ECC payment it was submitted for Maxis an employee would receive payment in "cancellation" of all outstanding and unvested options that the employee would otherwise be contractually entitled to. In effect, therefore, the employee surrenders the right to unvested options in return for consideration, namely, the payment of ECC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is the contention of Maxis the applicable principle of law is that a payment made to an employee to compensate him for the lapse of or the removal of his share option rights is not a benefit provided to the employee by reason of the employee's employment. [See the case of <i>Wilcock (Inspector of Taxes) v. Eve</i> [1995] STC 18]. It is Maxis' case that the ECC payment does not constitute additional cash remuneration of Maxis employees and the ECC payment therefore need not be reflected in Maxis' employees income statement for the year in which the ECC payment is paid to Maxis' employees.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The issue under appeal is on the payment of the ECC to the Maxis employees and the basis for taxation of an employment income. It is not disputed that the ECC being a cash payment is an employment income under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">Section 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We are of the view the ECC constitutes a perquisite under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;13.;;">s 13(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. The question to be decided is on the mechanism to tax such income. The basis for taxation of an employment income is provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1) of the Act</LINK> in which the employment income is taxed in the year an employee received such income. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">Section 25(1) of the Act</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is noted there is no definition of the word "perquisite" under the Act. Based on the <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i>, "perquisite" means "a privilege or benefit given in addition to one's salary or regular wages". In the present case Maxis' employees were offered to purchase Maxis' shares at a discounted price. In other words, the shares offered by the employer are lower than the market value of the shares. The offer and other matters relating to the shares are regulated by the Maxis Bye-Laws.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We are of the view in the case of ESOS, the benefit arising from the ESOS to the Maxis' employee is considered as a perquisite under the Act. By virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1A) of the Act</LINK>, the perquisite is taxed in the year the employee exercised the right to purchase the shares. The mechanism to tax the perquisite is in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">s 32(1A) of the Act</LINK> where the difference between the offer price and the lower of the market value of the shares on the date of offer is taxed as a perquisite.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It is to be noted the peculiar facts of the present case is that the ECC is a cash payment in substitution of the unvested options under the ESOS. The scheme had been cancelled pursuant to a Conditional Take-Over Offer by Binariang to acquire all voting shares in Maxis for a cash consideration.</p>
    <p>We are in agreement with the contention of the Revenue that both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> are not applicable to determine the taxability of the payment of the ECC as argued by Maxis. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">Section 25(1A) of the Act</LINK> provides for taxability of gross income from an employment in respect of any right to acquire shares as follows:</p>

    <p>Upon a plain reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">s 25(1A) of the Act</LINK>, the following elements must be in existence:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Based on the facts of the present case the employees of Maxis were offered the right to purchase the shares on the vested date. However, before the option is exercised, Maxis has been subjected to a takeover by Binariang. Thus, there were no shares to be offered to the employee. It is also noted that the date of the grant is not the date where the employees have acquired the right over the shares. The option is only vested on the employees, one third of each anniversary and the employee must exercise the right on or after the anniversary date. This is evidenced by ESOS By-laws where cl 7.1.1 states that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On the facts of the present case it is our judgment that the payment of the ECC is not based on ESOS. This is clearly different from ESOS because for the employee to be entitled for the shares under ESOS, they must purchase the shares. The payment which is based on the "adjusted offer price less option price" is only a mechanism for making the payment but does not reflect ESOS. By a letter dated 13 February 2008, Maxis tax consultant had indeed confirmed as follows: "that Maxis was delisted from the main board of Bursa Malaysia on 13 July 2007 and hence no listed share price can be attached to the shares ..." Hence, by this admission we are in agreement with the contention of the Revenue that the cash payment is not an ESOS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We are in agreement with the contention of the Revenue that there is no ambiguity as regards to the interpretation of the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> which in its ordinary meaning means that they are applicable to employment income (perquisite) in respect of any right to acquire shares and provide the mechanism to compute the value of shares/perquisite.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is our view that the words used and the intention of Parliament is clearly shown in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> that the provisions apply to shares and not to cash payment or the ECC. Even if the court is of the view that the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> are not clear and may include the payment of the ECC or cash payment, then the purposive approach to interpretation should be adopted. On this point in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_1;"><i>Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia v. Alam Maritim Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2014] 2 MLJ 1; [2014] 3 CLJ 421; [2013] 6 AMR 717, the Federal Court held at p 8 as follows:</p>

    <p>Useful reference can also be made to the Finance Bill 2005 to ascertain the intention of Parliament when enacting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK>.

      <b>[27]</b> From the above explanatory statements on the amendment to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32 of the Act</LINK>, it clearly shows that the intention of introducing the provisions is to clarify the tax treatment on income from employment on any right to acquire shares in a company. From the explanatory statement it is also made clear that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;25.;;">ss 25(1A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;32.;;">32(1A) of the Act</LINK> do not apply to benefit or perquisite received by an employee by way of cash payment.</p>

      <b>[28]</b> For the reasons abovestated we would answer the questions posed in this appeal as follows:</p>
