    <p>In the instant case, the appellants were travelling in a motor van ("the van"), when they were stopped at a roadblock manned by police personnel. Upon conducting a search of the van, the police found a speaker box at the rear passenger seat of the van, in which 23 slabs of compressed plant material were found hidden in the speaker box. This plant material was later sent for analysis and was found to be cannabis ("the drug"). Subsequently, the appellants were charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act")</LINK>. In their defence, the appellants testified that they had rented the van, from one Hamdi Masor ("SD3"). The van had been rented to another person by SD3 before being rented to the appellants. While on their journey in the van, the appellants had stopped to take some food and while they were eating one Abang Lah came to borrow the van from them. After the van was returned to them they both proceeded with their journey, when they were caught at the said roadblock. The Judicial Commissioner ("JC") had at the end of the trial, convicted and sentenced the appellants to death. In this appeal, the appellants contended that the JC failed to consider or appreciate the defence; the JC failed to apply the facts and inferences favourable to the appellants; the JC's finding that the appellants had <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drug based on the conduct of the appellants was fatally flawed; the JC did not rely on the presumption of possession afforded by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>; and the appellants were highly prejudiced when they were required to support their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> No burden is placed on an accused person to prove or establish any aspect of his defence. The burden is always on the prosecution, to prove every ingredient of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. A breach of these principles, could adversely affect the integrity of any finding relevant to the prosecution's case. An essential ingredient of the offence in this case was<i> mens rea</i> possession of the cannabis found in the van. In this instance, the JC had made various transgressions which in no small measure affected the integrity of the finding of <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drug by the appellants (<i>Tan Foo Su v. PP (refd)</i>). Following that, on the authority of<i>Ibrahim Mohamad and Anor v. PP</i>, the JC was manifestly wrong in finding that the appellants had mens rea possession based on their conduct when the cannabis was discovered in the van they were both in when they were arrested. (paras 11-14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The approach taken by the JC in determining the question of possession of the drug was also misconceived because it was patently clear that there was a non-application of facts and inferences favourable to the appellants. The JC might well have rejected or disbelieved all the pieces of evidence favourable to the appellants but what the JC should have done was to determine one way or another whether those facts and inferences had cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. (<i>Mat v. PP (refd)</i>). (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellants were also highly prejudiced by a patent misapprehension of the law when they were required to support their defence by calling witnesses and their failure to call supporting witnesses was the subject of adverse comment. In doing so, the JC had in the circumstances precluded any prospect of casting a reasonable doubt on the guilt of the appellants. (<i>Goh Ah Yew v. PP (refd)</i>). (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the circumstances, there was a real doubt that the prosecution had established the essential ingredient of possession. Hence, the convictions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> were not only unsafe but also unsustainable. Further, it was also inappropriate to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to find the appellants guilty of the lesser offence of possession of the drug, as the prosecution had failed to consider if any other person had rented the van and the use of the van by Abang Lah who could have had custody or control of the drug. Accordingly, the appellants' convictions were set aside. (para 17)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Linton Albert JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants were charged and convicted for trafficking in 21,585 grams of cannabis under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. They were both sentenced to death. Thus their appeal against conviction and sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The facts were these. On 25 February 2009 they were travelling in a motor van driven by the 1st appellant while the 2nd appellant sat as a passenger beside the 1st appellant. They were travelling along the Lebuh Raya Utara Selatan, Bukit Kayu Hitam, Kedah, when they were stopped at a roadblock manned by ASP Muhammad Zuraidi (SP3) and some police personnel. They were asked to get out of the van so that a search could be conducted inside. Lance Corporal Hashim bin Yasin (SP4) saw a speaker box at the rear passenger seat of the van. SP4 opened the lid of the speaker box, and put his hand inside it and took out a slab of compressed substance wrapped in plastic. SP4 alerted SP3 on what he found and SP3 ordered the arrest of the appellants. Both of them appeared scared and anxious. The 1st appellant was also trembling. A total of 23 slabs of compressed plant material were found hidden in the speaker box. They were sent for analysis and were found to constitute 21,585 grams of cannabis. Hence the charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. ASP Ishak bin Ali (SP7) the head of narcotics crime investigation at Kubang Pasu who arrived at the roadblock soon after the appellants were stopped testified that the 1st appellant admitted that the van belonged to him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The defence relied on the testimonies of both appellants each of whom gave evidence on oath and two other witnesses called by the defence. Briefly, the evidence given by them were these. The 1st appellant testified that on 25 February 2009 he was in his house when the 2nd appellant came to the house intending to rent a van. Together, they went to see Hamdi Masor (SD3) and rented the van from him. After taking the key, they both travelled in the van to Danok. On their way, they stopped to take some food and while they were eating one "Abang Lah" came to borrow the van from them. Abang Lah needed the van for only half an hour to buy things. After the van was returned to them they both proceeded with their journey towards the Thai border and thence towards Lebuh Raya Utara Selatan, Bukit Kayu Hitam. The 1st appellant testified that he could see the roadblock one kilometer in front of him as he was driving and could easily have turned back but did not do so because he did not know there were drugs inside the van.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The 2nd appellant confirmed that Abang Lah did borrow the van from them while they stopped on the way to eat. He had earlier gone to the 1st appellant's house and together they went to rent the van from SD3.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> SD3, a clerk at the Chin Hoe Transport, Danok confirmed that on 25 February 2009 both appellants came to his house to rent the van. He rented the van to the 1st appellant. He produced documents which were admitted as evidence, which showed that the owner of the van was one Seman Yeetuwa and that prior to 25 February 2009 the van was rented out to one Kambri Podo. One Ayub (SD4) testified that on 25 February 2009 he met Abang Lah or Abdullah who was driving a van bearing the registration number of the van rented out to the 1st appellant and Abang Lah or Abdullah told him that he was going to buy cigarettes. SD4, however, admitted he could not remember the registration number of the van driven by Abang Lah or Abdullah who was not called as a witness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The main thrust of this appeal revolved around the failure of the learned Judicial Commissioner to consider or appreciate the defence which rendered her finding that the appellants had <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drug fatally flawed. The learned Judicial Commissioner did not find it necessary to rely on the presumption of possession afforded by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> which states that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Instead, the learned Judicial Commissioner had relied on the indisputable fact that the 1st and 2nd appellants were in the van in which the drugs were found hidden in the speaker box in the rear passenger seat coupled with the conduct of the 1st and 2nd appellants when the drugs were discovered; both of them looked scared and anxious and the 1st appellant was trembling as well which, according to the learned Judicial Commissioner showed that they had a "guilty mind" or <i>means rea</i> possession of the drugs found by SP3 and SP4 in the van.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Thus, relying on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337, the learned Judicial Commissioner made a finding that the 1st and 2nd appellants had mens rea possession of the cannabis found in the van. In <i>Abdul Rahman Akif</i>, the discovery of the cannabis there was similar to the circumstances in the present appeal. The facts in that case are as stated in the headnote as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Arifin Zakaria FCJ (as he then was) delivering the judgment of the Federal Court which had reinstated and affirmed the conviction and sentence by the High Court said at p 572:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In concluding that the prosecution had established the essential element of <i>mens rea</i> possession of the cannabis by the 1st and 2nd appellants, numerous aspects of their defence were wrongly met with derision by the learned Judicial Commissioner which clearly demolished the integrity of the finding on <i>mens rea</i> possession. It is perhaps important to set out the instances where the learned Judicial Commissioner specifically referred to various aspects of the defence case with derision. They were these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> No burden is placed on an accused person to prove or establish any aspect of his defence. The burden is always on the prosecution, to prove every ingredient of the offence for which they were charged beyond reasonable doubt and here an essential ingredient of the offence was <i>mens rea</i> possession of the cannabis found in the van. An accused person is not required to prove his innocence nor is he required to call witnesses to support his innocence and any remark by the trial judge unfavourable to the defence by reason of the failure of the accused to do so is a misdirection. These are principles that constitute the pillar of our criminal justice system. It stood to reason, therefore, that a breach of any of these principles, could adversely affect the integrity of any finding relevant to the prosecution's case and in the present appeal the various transgressions by the learned Judicial Commissioner had in no small measure affected the integrity of the finding of <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drug by the 1st and 2nd appellants. These principles were encapsulated in the judgment of Raja Azlan Shah (as His Majesty then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1967_1_272;"><i>Tan Foo Su v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1967] 1 MLRH 272</LINK>; [1967] 2 MLJ 19, an authority cited by learned counsel for the 1st appellant at p 273:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It is perhaps useful to refer to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_181;"><i>Ibrahim Mohamad &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 181</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 387; [2011] 4 CLJ 113 an authority cited by both counsel for the 1st and 2nd appellants not least because the facts there were almost identical to the facts in the present appeal. The facts of the case as set out in the headnote read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The headnote which consists of excerpts of the judgment of Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin FCJ (as he then was) delivering the judgment of the Federal Court is reproduced <i>in extenso</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On the authority of <i>Ibrahim Mohamad (supra)</i> the learned Judicial Commissioner was manifestly wrong in finding that the 1st and 2nd appellants had <i>mens rea</i> possession based on their conduct when the cannabis was discovered in the van they were both in when they were arrested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The approach taken by the learned Judicial Commissioner in determining the question of possession of the drug was also misconceived because it was patently clear that there was non-application of facts and inferences favourable to the 1st and 2nd appellants. For example, the conduct of the 1st appellant in not making an escape by turning the van away from the roadblock when he could easily have done so because he could see the roadblock one kilometer away, did not feature in the determination of possession by the learned Judicial Commissioner. Curiously, the incontrovertible evidence in exh D41A that the van did not belong to the 1st appellant, that SD3 was the owner was also totally disregarded. For what it was worth, there was evidence that the van was rented out to another person on 24 February 2009 and returned to SD3 on the evening of 24 February 2009 and left outside SD3's house for the night until it was rented to the 1st appellant on 25 February 2009. There was also evidence that before they reached the roadblock the 1st and 2nd appellants had stopped for a meal during which the van was lent to and taken by one Abang Lah or Abdullah for half an hour which was totally ignored by the learned Judicial Commissioner. It did not matter whether the learned Judicial Commissioner accepted or believed these pieces of evidence which were favourable to the 1st and 2nd appellants. The learned Judicial Commissioner might well have rejected or disbelieved all these pieces of evidence but what she must do was to determine one way or another whether they cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1963_1_400;"><i>Mat v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1963] 1 MLRH 400</LINK>; [1982] 1b MLJ 13). The statement or the law on this aspect of our criminal justice system was set out by the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK> at p 161; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The 1st and 2nd appellants were also highly prejudiced by a patent misapprehension of the law when they were required to support their defence by calling witnesses and their failure to call supporting witnesses was the subject of adverse comment. In doing so, the learned Judicial Commissioner had in the circumstances precluded any prospect of casting a reasonable doubt on the guilt of the 1st and 2nd appellants. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1948_1_651;"><i>Goh Ah Yew v. PP</i> [1948] 1 MLRA 651</LINK>, Spencer-Wilkinson said this at p 654:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the circumstances aforesaid, there was real doubt in our mind that the prosecution had established the essential ingredient of possession. Hence the convictions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> were not only unsafe but also unsustainable. We did not find it appropriate to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to find the 1st and 2nd appellants guilty of the lesser offence of possession of the drug. This was because the prosecution had failed to exclude Abang Lah or Abdullah and the person who rented the van on 24 February 2009 as having custody or control of the cannabis. There was totally no attempt to do so. The prosecution merely relied on the fact that the 1st and 2nd appellants were found in the van where the cannabis was discovered and their equivocal conduct when the cannabis was discovered in the van (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_4_456;"><i>Ang Kian Chai v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 4 MLRA 456</LINK>). For the reasons aforesaid, we allowed the appeal of the 1st appellant and the 2nd appellant. Their convictions and sentences for trafficking in cannabis were set aside. We set the 1st appellant and the 2nd appellant free.</p>
