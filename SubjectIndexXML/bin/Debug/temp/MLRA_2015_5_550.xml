    <p>The plaintiff had obtained a Consent Judgment against one YWP Builders Sdn Bhd ("YWP Builders") and one other defendant which were jointly and severally ordered to pay the plaintiff a sum of RM1.1m by way of four installments. It was further ordered that in default of the installment payment, the whole sum would immediately become due and payable. YWP Builders thereafter issued four post-dated cheques. The defendant, who was a Director and officer of YWP Builders, had signed the cheques. All the cheques were marked "A/C Payee Only". YWP Builders later changed its name to YWP Construction Sdn Bhd, though it retained the same company number as YWP Builders. When the first post-dated cheque was presented for payment, it was dishonoured and the whole judgment sum became due and payable. The cheques however did not contain the new name of the company, ie YWP Construction Sdn Bhd but was indorsed with its previous name - YWP Builders and contained the same company number. The plaintiff thus applied to the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the Companies Act 1965 ("CA")</LINK>, to declare the defendant as the officer of YWP Builders who signed the four post-dated cheques, and that pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the CA</LINK>, the defendant pay the plaintiff the sum of RM1.1m. The High Court granted the declarations sought by the plaintiff and the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs</p>
    <p>Per Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court judge had not embarked upon any analysis of the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121 of the CA</LINK>. The judge erred in allowing the plaintiff's claim and in assuming that the limb in question of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK> applied to cheques. Limb (c) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> has the word "cheque" apart from other words such as "bills of exchange", "promissory note" and "negotiable instrument". However, the limb following limb (c) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> does not have the word "cheque" though it does have the other words such as "bills of exchange", "promissory note" and "negotiable instrument". Thus, the limb following limb (c) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK>, like limb (c) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> applies to "bills of exchange", "promissory notes" and "negotiable instruments", but the limb following limb (c) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> did not apply to "cheques", since the word "cheque" was omitted from the limb following limb (c) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the CA</LINK>. If the limb following limb (c) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK>, does not apply to cheques, then the failure to state the current name of the company in each of the four cheques, as a matter of law, would not entitle the plaintiff to claim from the defendant for payment in respect of the sums specified in the cheques pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the CA</LINK>. (paras 25-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Where the legislature includes a particular term in one part or section of a statute but omits it in another part or section of the same, it must be presumed that the legislature acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion. Therefore, the inclusion of the word 'cheque' in limb (c) of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK> and the exclusion of the word 'cheque' in the limb following limb (c) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> was done intentionally and purposely by Parliament. The Court must give effect to the intention of Parliament, ie that whilst the former limb (limb (c)) applies to cheques, the latter (subsequent) limb does not. (paras 33-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The plaintiff had assumed erroneously that the four cheques were negotiable instruments. In the instant case the four cheques were not negotiable instruments. Each of the four cheques was crossed with the words "A/C PAYEE ONLY" and this made the cheques non-transferable. By crossing a cheque with the words "Account Payee" the cheque would become non-transferable, meaning that the right of the payee to transfer the instrument would be taken away by the instrument. According to the common law, such an instrument would then no longer be a negotiable instrument but would constitute a mere contract between the parties. (paras 35, 38, 39, 40 &amp; 41)</p>
    <p>Per David Wong Dak Wah JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">Section 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 ("IA")</LINK> dictates that the court should first look for the purpose or object of the statute which, in the instant appeal, was <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the CA</LINK>. (paras 59- 60)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The object of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the CA</LINK> is to ensure that the payees of cheques are not deceived into believing that the director is signing on behalf of a totally different entity from that which the director signing the cheques belongs to. The question to be asked was whether in the circumstances before this court there was any deception in the instant case. (para 64)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, it could not be said that the plaintiff had been deceived or that the defendant had the intention to deceive. When <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the CA </LINK>was enacted in 15 April 1966, the existence and requirement of having the company's number endorsed on the cheques was not envisaged. Applying the purposive approach in constructing statutes, one must take into account the present prevailing circumstances and then give it an interpretation that enhances the object of the Act. In the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK>, the appellant should not be held liable since there was no deception as envisaged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the CA</LINK>. (para 66)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In interpreting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the CA</LINK>, the High Court would be guided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17.;;">s 17 of the IA</LINK> to give an interpretation that not only enhanced the object of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the CA</LINK>, but also reflected current times.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at Kuching delivered on 25 October 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The learned High Court Judge, upon hearing the respondent's originating summons application, had granted the following declaration and order:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The above declaration and order are made in accordance with the prayers sought for in the originating summons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> This case involves an interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the Companies Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">Section 121</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We heard the appeal on 16 April 2015. We reserved judgment. We announced that the court will deliver its judgment on 24 July 2015.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> This is my judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In the year 2012 the plaintiff (Hunfara Construction Sdn Bhd) commenced a civil suit ('the 2012 civil suit') against a company called 'YWP Builders Sdn Bhd' in the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at Kuching (there are other defendants as well in that 2012 civil suit but we are not concerned with them for the purpose of this appeal). It is not stated in the cause papers of the present originating summons as to the cause of action in that 2012 civil suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Be that as it may, on 28 March 2013 a consent judgment was obtained by the plaintiff against YWP Builders Sdn Bhd and one other defendant (of that 2012 civil suit) who were jointly and severally ordered to pay the plaintiff the sum of RM1,100,000.00 by way of four installment payments. (It is further ordered that in default of any installment payment, the whole judgment sum shall immediately become due and payable.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In the light of the Consent Judgment, YWP Builders Sdn Bhd issued the four cheques as mentioned earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It is not disputed that the defendant (Yung Ing Ing) when she issued the four cheques was a Director of the YWP Construction Sdn Bhd and is an officer of the company by virtue of the definition of "officer" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;4.;;">s 4 of the Companies Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> All the four cheques are post-dated cheques.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Each of the four cheques is crossed with the words 'A/C PAYEE ONLY'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 30 May 2013 the first cheque was dishonoured upon presentation for payment. (By virtue of the Consent Judgment, the whole judgment sum became due and payable with interest at the prescribed rate.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 24 December 2012 YWP Builders Sdn Bhd changed its name to 'YWP Construction Sdn Bhd'. The company number for YWP Builders Sdn Bhd was 761221-D. When YWP Builders Sdn Bhd changed its name to 'YWP Construction Sdn Bhd' it retains the same company number. In other words, the company number for YWP Construction Sdn Bhd is still 761221-D.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> However, the new name 'YWP Construction Sdn Bhd' is not mentioned on any of the four cheques. But the previous name of the company, that is, 'YWP Builders Sdn Bhd' is mentioned. The company number for 'YWP Builders Sdn Bhd', that is, 761221-D, is also stated in each of the four cheques, next to the company's name.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The name of the company when the 2012 civil suit was commenced was 'YWP Builders Sdn Bhd' and the Consent Judgment was made in that name.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> To-date, neither the defendant nor the company has made any payment for the sum due under the Consent Judgment despite the company and the defendant having received the letter of demand dated 7 June 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The originating summons was filed on 12 July 2013. At the time of the filing of the originating summons only the first and second cheques (dated 30 May 2013 and 30 June 2013, respectively) were due for payment. The third and fourth cheques were not.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Except for the first cheque, the other three cheques were never presented to the bank for payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiff's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It is the contention of the plaintiff that pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the Companies Act</LINK>, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the sum of RM1,100,000.00 being the total 'amount due' on the four cheques, in default of payment by the company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is the further contention that the word 'negotiable instrument' in that limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> (the limb after limb (c)) that states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>includes cheques.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defendant's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It is the contention of the defendant that there was no breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the Companies Act</LINK> since the former name of the company (that is to say, 'YWP Builders Sdn Bhd') and the company number '761221-D' (which is also the same company number for YWP Construction Sdn Bhd) are stated on each of the four cheques. Thus, there was no intention to deceive anyone and it is clear to anyone receiving the four cheques that they were company cheques for 'YWP Builders Sdn Bhd.'/'YWP Construction Sdn Bhd', and not the personal cheques of the defendant. It is argued that in interpreting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the Companies Act</LINK> the Court must adopt a purposive approach, citing the following English cases:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is the further submission of the defendant that the plaintiff's claim in respect of the third and fourth cheques is premature as at the time of the filing of the originating summons (12 July 2013) these two post-dated cheques were not yet due for payment and were never presented to the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> At the High Court of Kuching the learned judge allowed the plaintiff's originating summons application. The learned judge ruled:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The learned High Court Judge, in her grounds of judgment, did not embark upon any analysis of the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121 of the Companies Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>My Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In my judgment the learned High Court Judge, with respect, erred in allowing the plaintiff's claim and in assuming that the limb in question of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121 of the Companies Act</LINK> applies to cheques.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is important to note that limb (c) of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121 of the Companies Act</LINK> has the word 'cheque' in it, apart from the words 'bill of exchange', 'promissory note' and 'other negotiable instrument'. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">Section 121(2)</LINK> limb (c) reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> And it is also pertinent to note that that limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> following limb (c) of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK>, whilst, like limb (c) of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK>, it has the words 'bill of exchange', 'promissory note' and 'other negotiable instrument' in it, yet there is a significant difference in the wording between the two limbs: for, unlike limb (c) of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK>, this latter limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)</LINK> does not have the word 'cheque' in it. It merely reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> This being the scheme of the drafting of the provision, in my judgment, it must be ruled that this particular (or latter) limb of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK>, although, like limb (c) of subsection (2), it applies to bills of exchange, promissory notes and negotiable instruments, it does not, however, apply to cheques. This must be the intention of the Act; for, otherwise, why is it that limb (c) of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK> has the word 'cheque' in it (besides the words 'bill of exchange', 'promissory note' and 'other negotiable instrument'), yet the word 'cheque' was omitted from the subsequent (or latter) limb of subsection (2) of that section, whilst references to 'bill of exchange', 'promissory note' and 'other negotiable instrument' were retained? If the latter limb does not apply to cheques then the failure to state the current name of the company in each of the four cheques, as a matter of law, does not entitle the plaintiff to claim from the defendant for payment in respect of the sums as specified in the cheques pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2) of the Companies Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In my judgment it is a principle of interpretation of statutes that where the legislature includes a particular term in one part or section of a statute but omits it in another part or section of the same, it must be presumed that the legislature acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion. There are the principles of construction as pointed out by <i>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</i> (LexisNexis 5<sup>th</sup> edn at pp 1157, 1160):</p>

      <b>[34]</b> Therefore, the inclusion of the word 'cheque' in limb (c) of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK> and the exclusion of the word 'cheque' in the latter limb of that subsection was done intentionally and purposely by Parliament; and the court must give effect to the intention of Parliament: that whilst the former limb (limb (c)) applies to cheques, the latter (subsequent) limb does not.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It appears to me that the plaintiff seems to be conscious of the absence of the word 'cheque' in the later limb of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK>; and that explains its reliance on the words 'other negotiable instruments' in its written submission to justify its contention that this latter limb applies to cheques as well. The plaintiff assumes, albeit rather erroneously, that the four cheques are 'negotiable instruments'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The defendant, however, in her written submission, unfortunately, appears to be oblivious to the absence of the word 'cheque' in the latter limb of the subsection. But assuming that the defendant (or her learned counsel) was in fact conscious of the omission of the word 'cheque' in the latter limb of the subsection in question, it is rather puzzling that she (or her counsel) could have overlooked the fact that such an omission does have an important implication in terms of statutory interpretation - an implication that would be to the defendant's favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The learned High Court Judge, as I have pointed out earlier, also did not touch on this issue (that is, on the omission of the word 'cheque') in her grounds of judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether The Four Cheques Are Negotiable Instruments?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In any event, even assuming for the moment that the words 'negotiable instruments' in the latter limb of subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121</LINK> include cheques, as contended by the plaintiff, it is, however, my view that in the present case the four cheques, in law, are not negotiable instruments. It is true that cheques, like bills of exchange and promissory notes, are forms of negotiable instruments. However, in the present case, each of the four cheques is crossed with the words 'A/C PAYEE ONLY'. This makes the cheques non-transferable. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;81A.;;">Section 81A of the Bills of Exchange Act 1949 ('the Bills of Exchange Act')</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Now, one of the basic attributes of a negotiable instrument is the right of the payee to transfer the instrument to another person. In Poh Chu Chai on <i>Law of Negotiable Instruments</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> edn, at p 6, the learned author enlightens us on the law governing negotiable instruments as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The common law of England continues to apply in Malaysia by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;3.;;">s 3 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> By crossing a cheque with the words 'Account Payee' the cheque becomes non-transferable meaning that the right of the payee to transfer the instrument is taken away by the instrument. According to the common law, such an instrument is then no longer a negotiable instrument but constitutes a mere contract between the parties (see Poh Chu Chai on Law of Negotiable Instruments, 5<sup>th</sup> edn at p 384).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In the light of the reasons as given the above, I am allowing the appeal with costs of RM10,000 to the appellant/defendant for here and below. The order of the High Court is set aside; and the deposit refunded to the appellant/ defendant.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the High Court in which the learned judge found the appellant personally liable for four cheques amounting to RM1,100,000.00 issued to the respondent on behalf of a company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> On 16 April 2015, we heard the appeal and reserved judgment to 24 July 2015. I now give my grounds and decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The factual matrix is fairly straightforward. They are undisputed and are as set out in both the submissions of counsel for the appellant and respondent which I adopt with the appropriate amendments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> YWP Builders Sdn Bhd changed its name to YWP Construction Sdn Bhd on 12 July 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The appellant was at the material time a Director of YWP Construction Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> On 28 March 2013, a Consent Judgment under Suit No: KCH-22-11- 1-2012 was obtained by the respondent against YWP Builders Sdn Bhd and Yung Wei Pong in which YWP Builders Sdn Bhd and Yung Wei Pong were ordered to jointly and severally pay the sum of RM1,100,000.00 by four instalments. It was also ordered that in default of any instalment payment, the whole remaining judgment sum shall be immediately due and payable together with interest at 5% per annum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Pursuant to the Consent Judgment, YWP Builders Sdn Bhd issued four cheques to the respondent wherein the name of the company stated in the cheques remained as YWP Builders Sdn Bhd as opposed to the new name YWP Construction Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The four cheques were for the following sums:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The company number for YWP Builders Sdn Bhd and YWP Construction Sdn Bhd is the same which is 761221-D. The reason is simply that in situation involving only in a change of a company's name the company number remains.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The name of the company when Suit No: KCH-22-11-1-2012 was commenced was YWP Builders Sdn Bhd and the Consent Judgment was made in the name of YWP Builders Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The cheques issued by YWP Builders Sdn Bhd each bear the name of "YWP Builders Sdn Bhd" and the aforesaid company number.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> As holder of the four post-dated cheques, the respondent filed in an application for an order that the appellant be made personally liable for the four post-dated cheques premised on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Decision And Grounds</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The learned judge sustained the respondent's application premised on her construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c) of the Companies Act</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The learned judge held that the aforesaid provision applies to the factual matrix before her and the rationale in her words is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> It is conceded by counsel for the appellant that the three elements listed above have been satisfied if the learned judge's construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK> is upheld. However, learned counsel urges the court to adopt a construction reflecting the time we live in now.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In construing any statute, the starting point in my view is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> It can be said then <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A</LINK> dictates that the court should first look for the purpose or object of the statute and in this appeal it is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant referred the Court to the English decisions (<i>F Stacy and Co (Limited) v. Wallis and Others</i> [1912] 106 LT 544, Penrose v. Martyr (EB and E, 499), <i>Atkin and Co v. Wardle and Others</i> [1889] The Law Times Vol LXI 23 and <i>Banque de' Indochine et de Suez SA v. Euroseas Group Finance Co Ltd and Others</i> [1981] 3 All ER 198) where the English Courts considered a similar provision to that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK> in s 63 of the British Companies Act 1908 which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The English Courts held that "the intention of the enactment plainly was to prevent persons from being deceived into believing that they had a security with the unlimited liability of common law when they had but the security of a company limited." (as per Justice Crompton in <i>Penrose v. Martyr</i> (EB and E, 499))</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Denman J in <i>Atkin and Co v. Wardle and Others</i> [1889] The Law Times Vol LXI 23 Commenting on ss 41 and 42 of the Companies Act 1862 (England) said as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Premised on the English authorities, it can be said that the object of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK> is to ensure that the payees of cheques are not deceived into believing that the director is signing on behalf of a totally different entity from that the director signing the cheques belongs to. The question to be asked whether in the circumstances before this court was there any deception here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> To recap, it is undisputed here that the appellant was never a party to the Consent Judgment which was between the respondent, YWP Builders Sdn Bhd and Yung Wei Pong. That Consent Judgment required payments from YWP Builders Sdn Bhd and not from the appellant. However the appellant being a Director of YWP Builders Sdn Bhd issued four cheques to comply with the Consent Judgment. The crucial undisputed fact is that YWP Builders Sdn Bhd has by then changed its name to YWP Construction Sdn Bhd and the four cheques though still carried the old name of YWP Builders Sdn Bhd had the same company number which in law never changes despite of any name changes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> With that same company number endorsed on the four cheques, can it be said that the respondent had been deceived or that the appellant had the intention to deceive. It is my view that the answer must be in the negative. It is undisputed that when <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK> was enacted in 15 April 1966, it can be said that the existence and requirement of having the company's number endorsed on the cheques was not envisaged. Applying the purposive approach in constructing statute, one must take into account of the present prevailing circumstances and then give it an interpretation which enhances the object of the Act. In the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK>, it is my interpretation that the appellant should not be held liable as there is no deception as envisaged in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> Further one must not lose sight of a basic principle of Company Law and that is the rule of <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> [1843] 67 ER 189 which prescribes that a company is a separate and independent legal entity which can be sued or sue. Only by clear legislation, can this basic principle be dismantled. Hence in interpreting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK>, this basic principle must be given its due regard which I have done so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> This is another case where there is no local case law on a specific provision of our Companies Act. Be that as it may, I am guided by the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> to give it an interpretation which not only enhances the object of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK> but also reflects the time which we live in. Legislations must continue to evolve and courts have a duty in this respect provided of course it does not do damage to the words employed therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The interpretation which I have given reflects what I said in the previous paragraph.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> Accordingly I find that the respondent does not have a cause of action under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;121.;;">s 121(2)(c)</LINK> and allow the appeal with costs in the sum of RM10,000.00 for here and below. I also order that the orders of High Court be set aside and the deposit be refunded to the appellant.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
