    <p>The defendant in this case had resolved the plaintiff's claim by paying a sum of money in full and final settlement of the plaintiff's debt. As a consequence of such settlement, the plaintiff withdrew its claim against the defendant. The defendant, however, sought to maintain its third party claim. The specific question that was determined in the High Court was whether the defendant's third party claim was sustainable in light of the withdrawal of the action by the plaintiff against the defendant. The High Court concluded that the defendant could no longer sustain its claim against the third party, by reason of the plaintiff having withdrawn its claim against the defendant. The High Court found that as there was no finding of 'liability' by way of a judgment against the defendant, his claim for an indemnity from the third party bank was extinguished. The defendant brought this appeal against the decision of the High Court.</p>

      <i>Stott v.

However that did not detract from the fact that the defendant effectively accepted responsibility in law for the loss suffered by the plaintiff, and made good that loss to the extent of the sum paid. To that extent therefore it was clear that he was effectively 'liable' or 'responsible in law' to the plaintiff for that sum of money. Having accepted such responsibility in law, he was entitled to seek contribution from the respondent third party bank who was another or joint tortfeasor. (paras 19-20)</p>

      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The primary issue of law, which arose for consideration in this appeal, was whether a third party claim by a defendant, stands extinguished by reason of the defendant resolving the claim between itself and the plaintiff. In the instant case, the defendant had resolved the plaintiff's claim by paying a sum of money in full and final settlement of the plaintiff's debt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> As a consequence of such settlement, the plaintiff withdrew its claim against the defendant. The defendant however, sought to maintain and prosecute its third party claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The specific question that was determined in the High Court, by way of an application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;14A.;;">O 14A of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>, was whether the defendant's third party claim was sustainable in light of the withdrawal of the action by the plaintiff against, <i>inter alia</i>, the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned judge concluded that the defendant could no longer sustain its claim against the third party, by reason of the plaintiff having withdrawn its claim against the defendant. It is against this decision that the defendant, who is the appellant here, founded his appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 24 November 2014 this appeal was heard and allowed. We determined that the appellant's third party claim against the respondent was in fact sustainable notwithstanding the resolution and subsequent withdrawal by the plaintiff of its action against the appellant who was the defendant in the court below. It followed as a consequence of this determination that the appellant is entitled to judgment against the respondent third party. As such we set aside the decision of the High Court in relation to this question only and awarded costs to the appellant. The full reasons for our decision are as set out below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Salient Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The largely undisputed, although somewhat convoluted facts have been comprehensively set out in both the judgment of the High Court and the submissions of the appellant, which we adopt:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned judge in the court below determined that the appellant was not entitled to proceed to prosecute its third party claim against the respondent third party bank premised primarily on the relief sought by the appellant against the respondent third party bank:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned judge concluded that the "fate" of the appellant's third party claim was directly linked and subject to, and hinges on the success of the plaintiff's main claim against the appellant. In view of the settlement as contained in the consent judgment which resulted in the plaintiff, (ie The Nova Scotia Bank) withdrawing its action against the appellant, it was determined by the High Court that the appellant's claim against the respondent third party bank was simply no longer sustainable. The rationale put forward was that upon withdrawal of the plaintiff's claim, such claim stood extinguished. As the claim by the plaintiff against the appellant no longer subsisted, the learned judge decided that the appellant could not maintain his claim against the respondent third party bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The fact that the issue of liability was not determined in the consent judgment contributed to the learned judge's decision that the second third party proceedings were no longer sustainable. Her Ladyship concluded that the appellant could only proceed against the third party if it was decided by the High Court in the main claim that the appellant is liable to the plaintiff. There was therefore no basis for the appellant's claim for an indemnity from the respondent third party bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reasons For Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The primary question for our determination was whether the appellant was entitled to pursue the second third party proceedings after having agreed to enter a consent judgment with the plaintiff by paying the sum of RM125,000.00 without any admission of liability. This in turn warranted a consideration of the question whether liability under third party proceedings could only arise and was confined solely to situations where there was a specific finding of liability as between the plaintiff and the defendant, or whether such liability could and did extend to situations where the primary dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant had been resolved amicably by way of settlement with no finding of liability, or by way of a consent judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The starting point for this issue must be a consideration of the nature of a third party proceeding. Third party proceedings are the adjectival or procedural 'vehicle', as it were, that enables a defendant in a suit brought against it by a plaintiff, to seek contribution from a third party who has contributed to, or caused such liability to arise as between the plaintiff and the defendant. The substantive provisions allowing for such a contribution or third party claim can arise both in contract and in tort. In the instant case, the allegation by the appellant against the respondent third party bank is premised on negligence. The appellant essentially seeks a contribution in terms of damages from the respondent third party bank, as another or joint tortfeasor. The substantive provisions in law in relation to contribution by joint tortfeasors is to be found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;10.;;">s 10(1)(c) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>. It provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Of relevance in the construction of this section is the Supreme court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1988_1_294;"><i>Mat Abu Man v. Medical Superintendent, General Hospital Taiping &amp;amp; Ors</i> [1988] 1 MLRA 294</LINK>; [1989] 1 MLJ 226; [1989] 1 CLJ 98 ('<i>Mat Abu</i>'s case') where Hashim Yeop Sani CJ (Malaya) held, <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Two salient points may be gleaned:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In the court below the learned judge concluded that as there was no finding of 'liability' by way of a judgment against the appellant (qua defendant), he enjoyed no right to claim an indemnity from the respondent third party bank as tortfeasor, for damages. The learned judge was also of the view, contrary to the foregoing passage in <i>Mat Abu</i>'s case that third party proceedings are not independent but instead, hinge upon, and are entirely dependent upon an express finding of liability between a plaintiff and a defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Is it then correct to say that third party proceedings can only be founded upon a finding of liability against the defendant in the primary suit between the plaintiff and the defendant? This in turn begs the question of what meaning is to be accorded to the term 'liable'? Is the term confined solely to a situation where a party is 'held liable by judgment' or is it to be accorded a wider connotation, so as to extend to a situation where a claim between the plaintiff and defendant has been settled by the payment of monies?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> This issue was considered in the English Court of Appeal decision of <i>Stott v. West Yorkshire Road Car Co Home Bakeries Ltd and Another</i> [1971] 2 QB 651. The case involved a road traffic collision between a motorcycle (the plaintiff), an oncoming bus (the defendants) and a parked van (the third party). The plaintiff who was injured in the accident brought an action against the defendants. The defendants in turn brought third party proceedings against the parked van, seeking contribution. Third party directions were given under which the third party issue was to be decided immediately after the main action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> However by a settlement in writing the plaintiff accepted a sum of money in discharge of his claim against the defendants and acknowledged that it was made without any contribution by the third parties. The settlement was also "without any admission of liability" by the defendants. Upon the registrar ordering that the third party proceedings should proceed and the matter be set down for trial, the third party appealed. The judge of first instance allowed the appeal determining that no third party proceedings should ensue in view of the settlement of the plaintiff's claim without admission of liability.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> His decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal. The primary issue for consideration there, as is the case here, was the meaning to be accorded to the term 'liability'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Lord Denning (MR) in dealing with the point considered the English equivalent of our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;10.;;">s 10(1)(c) of the Civil Law Act</LINK> in the form of the then Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 where the words used in relation to contribution by a joint tortfeasor are similar. More specifically he considered the definition to be accorded to the word 'liable' in relation to s 6(1)(c) of the 1935 Act. He concluded as follows (at p 656, para H last line):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The foregoing case is persuasive authority for the proposition that the word 'liable' ought to be construed so as to include situations where a defendant has been held liable in judgment, has admitted liability or has settled the matter by making payment to the plaintiff even though this is done without an admission of liability.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In the instant case it is evident from the records of the court that the appellant here not only settled the matter by paying out a sum of RM125,000.00 to the plaintiff, but entered a consent judgment to that effect. The only 'anomaly' as it were, was the appellant's insistence that the payment was without an admission of liability. However that does not detract from the fact that the appellant effectively accepted responsibility in law for the loss suffered by the plaintiff, and made good that loss to the extent of RM125,000.00. To that extent therefore it is clear that he was effectively 'liable' or 'responsible in law' to the plaintiff in that sum of money.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It therefore follows that having accepted such responsibility in law, he is entitled to seek contribution from the respondent third party bank who is another or joint tortfeasor. This is borne out by the decision in Suit 1353 where another judge of the High Court found the respondent third party bank negligent and therefore accountable in damages for all losses suffered by the appellant as a partner of the legal firm of K Siladass &amp; Partners.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> For these reasons we were of the view that the appellant's claim emanating from the second third party proceedings was not extinguished by the settlement reached between the plaintiff and the appellant (qua defendant) whereby the appellant paid a sum of RM125,000.00 to the plaintiff with no admission of liability by the appellant, and entered into a consent judgment, pursuant to which the plaintiff's claim was withdrawn against the appellant. The appeal was therefore allowed and the order of the High Court in relation to this question in prayer 1(i) of the application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As a consequence of our decision on this question of law (as explained above) the appellant was entitled to, and was therefore duly granted judgment against the respondent third party bank in terms of the prayers in their third party notice dated 16 May 2013. The parties agreed to costs of RM10,000.00 to the appellant for proceedings in both the High Court and the appeal. The deposit was refunded.</p>
