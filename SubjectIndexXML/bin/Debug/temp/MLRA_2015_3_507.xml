    <p>The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent had been in the employment of the appellant for 17 years when he was dismissed on 14 March 2001, after domestic enquiry proceedings. At the time of his dismissal, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was only 14 months away from the mandatory retirement age of 55 years. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent challenged his dismissal in the Industrial Court, which <i>inter alia</i> decided in his favour and awarded him compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement, and 24 months' backwages. The appellant applied to quash the award in the High Court, which application was dismissed. The High Court maintained the award for compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement but reduced the backwages from 24 months to 14 months. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court's decision, on the wrong appellant's appeal. The appellant obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court on the following question: "Whether compensation in lieu of reinstatement could be awarded to a person who cannot be reinstated and whether the issue of reinstatement would even arise where such person had already attained the age of retirement at the time of his filing of the claim (under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ("IRA 1967")</LINK>)".</p>

      <b>Mohamed Apandi Ali FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Leave Question</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This court had, on 6 January 2014, granted leave to the appellant to appeal on a single question of law, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The salient facts of this case which are not disputed are as follows. So Lai ("the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent") had been in the employment of the appellant company for 17 years when he was dismissed on 14 March 2001. He was then a Redistribution Stockist Operation Supervisor and his dismissal was consequential to a domestic enquiry conducted by the appellant company, based on allegations of receiving unauthorised payments from a complainant, one Tey Hup Heng Trading Sdn Bhd. At the time of his dismissal, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was, according to his terms and conditions of service, only 14 months away from his mandatory retirement age of 55 years. He was deemed to have started working with the appellant company since 22 February 1984, after the appellant bought over the business from his earlier employer company in 1995.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent challenged his dismissal by filing a complaint to the Industrial Court ("the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent") pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ("the IRA 1967")</LINK>. The Industrial Court decided in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent and proceeded to award compensation in lieu of reinstatement, calculated based on the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's years of service and in addition awarded backwages for 24 months.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Being dissatisfied with the Industrial Court's decision, the appellant filed for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> and applied for an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the said award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The application for <i>certiorari</i> was dismissed by the High Court. The award on dismissal was upheld. The award on compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement was also upheld but the award in respect of backwages was reduced from 24 months to 14 months, namely the period to the retirement age at 55, of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's appeal and affirmed the decision of the High Court, in respect of the compensation awarded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings By The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In view of the narrow scope of the leave question posed to this court, it is pertinent to highlight only parts of the judgment of the High Court relating to the issue at hand, namely compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement when the dismissed employee had already attained the age of retirement at the time of filing his claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the IRA 1967</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On this issue, the learned Judicial Commissioner in his grounds of judgment, observed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings By The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Court of Appeal merely affirmed the decision of the High Court, and <i>inter alia</i>, held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions By Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the primary remedy as reflected under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20(1) of the IRA 1967</LINK> is for a reinstatement of the complainant. He relied on a High Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1991_2_246;"><i>Holiday Inn Kuching v. Elizabeth Lee Chai Siok</i> [1991] 2 MELR 246</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_3_455;">[1991] 3 MLRH 455</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 230; [1992] 1 CLJ 141; [1992] 2 CLJ (Rep) 521 which held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant also argued that although <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the IRA 1967</LINK> empowers the Industrial Court to act in accordance with equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities and legal form, it does not confer the court the power to order compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement if a person is not in a position to be reinstated in the first place. Learned counsel, on this point, relied and referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2001_3_369;"><i>Nestle Food Storage (Sabah) Sdn Bhd v. Terrence Tan Nyang Yin</i> [2001] 3 MELR 369</LINK>; [2002] 1 ILR 280, where the Industrial Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant further relied on the Court of Appeal decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2014_3_401;"><i>Sabah Forest Industries Sdn Bhd v. Industrial Court Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2014] 3 MELR 401</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_5_543;">[2014] 5 MLRA 543</LINK>; [2014] 8 CLJ 876; [2014] 4 ILR 258, which held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Learned counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent however canvassed that compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement is permissible under the Industrial Court Practice Note No 1 of 1987 and in support of such argument, learned counsel relied on the Court Appeal decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_2_832;"><i>Telekom Malaysia Bhd v. Ramli Akim</i> [2007] 2 MLRA 832</LINK>; [2008] 1 MLJ 770; [2008] 1 CLJ 440; [2006] 1 AMR 179. Learned counsel also relied on the judgment of this very case at the Court of Appeal, where the court in essence held that "... such award is not limited to the remaining period of employment. This award should be distinguished from the award for backwages which is subject to such limitation".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent also relied on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2008_3_678;"><i>Chong Lam Hong v. Ka Panel Technology Printers Sdn Bhd</i> [2008] 3 MELR 678</LINK>, which relied on the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1981_1_472;"><i>Dr A Dutt v. Assunta Hospital</i> [1981] 1 MLRA 472</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 304 in his argument that the Industrial Court is authorised to award compensation where reinstatement is not appropriate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Analysis And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> At the outset, it must be acknowledged that under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA 1967</LINK> the Industrial Court has the power to make an order for reinstatement or an award of compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement. The core issue at hand, is whether an award of compensation can be given when reinstatement cannot be ordered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Before we embark on our analysis of the respective submission, it may be appropriate to appraise the facts of the case, namely the attainment of the age of retirement of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent. This undisputed fact can be seen from the findings of the Industrial Court, which, <i>inter alia</i> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The leave question speaks of a claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the IRA 1967</LINK>, where the relevant parts read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In making such an award, the court is governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30 of the IRA 1967</LINK>, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The leave question also speaks of "compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement". The key words "compensation", "<i>in lieu</i> of " and "reinstatement" are not defined in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA 1967</LINK>. The Law Lexicon defines "<i>in lieu</i> of "' as signifying "instead of " and "in place of ". Therefore reading the words "compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement" in plain English it means that such compensation was meant to be a replacement or a substitute or an alternative to reinstatement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> From the phrase "compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement", it is our judgment that the element of compensation will only arise when the employee is in a position or situation to be reinstated. It is a condition precedent to such compensation. Our view is fortified by the clear provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20(1) of the IRA 1967</LINK>, where the primary remedy of such a representation to the Director General is for the workman "to be reinstated in his former employment". If a workman cannot be reinstated because his age has exceeded his retirement age, the issue of compensation cannot arise. Corollary to that logic, it cannot be <i>in lieu</i> of his reinstatement. After all, reinstatement is a statutorily recognised form of specific performance. On that premise, such specific performance can only be ordered in a situation where the legal basis for such performance does exist. One cannot substitute when the one to be substituted does not or cannot exist. This can be seen in the legal maxim: <i>"lex non cogit ad impossiblia"</i>, ie the law does not compel the impossible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Even though <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the IRA 1967</LINK> speaks of the court shall act "according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities and legal form", there must be a legal basis for such as action. On this, it would be suffice to refer to the judgment of Salleh Abas FJ (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1979_1_197;"><i>Hotel Jaya Puri Bhd v. National Union Of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers &amp; Anor</i> [1979] 1 MLRH 197</LINK>; [1980] 1 MLJ 109, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In a similar vein, KC Vohrah J in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2001_3_480;"><i>Hj Md Ison Baba v. Swedish Motor Assemblies Sdn Bhd</i> [2001] 3 MELR 480</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_3_546;">[2001] 3 MLRH 546</LINK>; [2001] 8 CLJ 180, wrote as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The above analysis formed the rationale of the Court of Appeal's decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2014_3_401;"><i>Sabah Forest Industries Sdn Bhd v. Industrial Court Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2014] 3 MELR 401</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_5_543;">[2014] 5 MLRA 543</LINK>; [2014] 8 CLJ 876; [2014] 4 ILR 258, Raus Sharif PCA concluded that the Industrial Court "fell into error when it awarded compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement when clearly the second respondent cannot be reinstated beyond his retirement age. The Industrial Court had no legal basis to award ... compensation in lieu of reinstatement."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> For reasons explained above, we see no reason to disagree with that particular legal pronouncement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> For completeness, perhaps it is proper to analyse the reason for such errors to have been committed over the years. To our mind the error lies in the confusion that emanates from the misapprehension of what is known as <i>Practice Note No 1 of 1987</i>. Practice Note No 1 of 1987, is reproduced in <i>extenso</i> and reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> A careful reading of the said Practice Note will reveal that it is silent on the issue of whether the worker is still eligible to be reinstated at the material time when the award is made. The Practice Note is in reality an internal administrative circular meant to be a guideline in calculating compensation. Such circular does not have the force of law. The Practice Note cannot be construed as a statement of a legal principle. It will be erroneous to do so. The Practice Note cannot be taken to be a concept stipulating that it is a <i>carte blanche</i> for compensation to be awarded (in all cases) <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> For the above reasons, we will answer the leave question in the negative. In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the orders made by the courts below, in respect of compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent. Consequentially, we order the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent to return to the appellant, the sum paid by the appellant as compensation <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement. In the circumstances of the case, we shall not make any order as to costs.</p>
