    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the plaintiff's appeal against the dismissal of its claim against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants by the High Court which was upheld by the Court of Appeal. This appeal only concerned the 1st and 2nd defendants. The 2nd and 3rd defendants had teamed up to form a joint venture ('the AAY-MMN Joint Venture') in order to tender for a project. The plaintiff claimed that it had been invited by the defendants to jointly participate with them in submitting a tender for the project and asserted in its amended statement of claim that such understanding amongst the parties resulted in the formation of a joint venture between them as evidenced by the pre-tender agreement ('the agreement') which the plaintiff entered with the 1st defendant. The plaintiff claimed that under the joint venture it was understood that it would be awarded the sub sub-contract works in the project. Subsequently, the successful bidder for the project was AAY-MMN Joint Venture which was not the same as the joint venture alluded to by the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff claimed that, notwithstanding the award of the said project to the AAY-MMN Joint Venture, the defendants had breached the joint venture with the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiff claimed that while the 1st defendant was not awarded the sub-contract works, in fact it performed the works for the 2nd defendant thus circumventing its contractual obligations to the plaintiff. On the other hand, the 1st defendant claimed that as it was not awarded the sub-contract works, cl F of the agreement applied thereby making the agreement void. In this appeal, the leave questions centered on one legal issue, ie whether contractual obligations could be frustrated or avoided by shifting responsibility from one company to another within a group of companies belonging to the same family.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> From a perusal of the plaintiff's amended statement of claim, there was no allegation that the plaintiff was not awarded the sub sub-contract works as a result of manipulation or the abuse of the 'single' entity of the defendants. There was also no allegation in the amended statement of claim of fraud or equitable fraud or misrepresentation practiced by the defendants upon the plaintiff during the discussion in the preparation of quotation or tender documents for the project. Consequently, the allegations as pleaded were not sufficient as a plea for fraud or equitable fraud or to indicate special circumstances upon which on evidence adduced would justify the lifting of the corporate veil of the defendants. (paras 34, 35, 36, 37 &amp; 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It is trite law that the plaintiff is bound by its own pleadings. The plaintiff was not permitted to improve its pleading in any other manner other than by way of an application to amend. In this appeal, based on the plaintiff's pleadings, the plaintiff had no basis to seek for the lifting of the corporate veil of the defendants or to insist that there was an abuse by the defendants of the concept of corporate separate entities. (paras 41, 42 &amp; 47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> With respect to the plaintiff's pleadings, the plaintiff only alleged that the breach was on the joint venture. Since there was in fact no such joint venture, the issue of breach did not arise. Thus, assuming the breach was related to the pre-tender agreement, the evidence adduced disclosed the reason for the failure of the 1st defendant to get the sub-contract works in the project. As a result, cl F applied, thereby making the pre-tender agreement void. Accordingly, based on the pleaded case of the plaintiff, there was no necessity to answer the questions posed in this appeal. (paras 49-50)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Richard Malanjum CJSS:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 10 December 2013, this court granted leave to the appellant, the plaintiff in the action, to appeal on the following questions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This appeal is only against the 1st and 2nd respondents who were the 1st and 2nd defendants in the action. The appeal against MMN Bina Sdn Bhd, the 3rd defendant in the action, was discontinued at the Court of Appeal. As such, any claim against the 3rd defendant is no longer relevant before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> For ease of reference, in this judgment, the appellant will be referred to as the plaintiff while the 1st and 2nd respondents will be collectively referred to as the defendants and/or as the 1st and 2nd defendants, where the context so require. For convenience, MMN Bina Sdn Bhd will be referred to as the 3rd defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff is dissatisfied with the dismissal of its claim against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants by the High Court which was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The counterclaim by the 1st defendant against the plaintiff was allowed by the High Court but on appeal, was reversed by the Court of Appeal. There is no appeal against the dismissal of the counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The plaintiff is a company incorporated under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">Companies Act 1965 </LINK>('the Act'). It is engaged in the business of building and civil engineering construction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The 1st and 2nd defendants are companies incorporated under the Act. Both are also involved in the same activities as the plaintiff but with the 1st defendant principally engaged in earthworks.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 3rd defendant is also a company registered under the Act, but with Bumiputera status. It too, is involved in the business of building construction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> There was a project of the Jabatan Bekalan Air Negeri Pahang Darul Makmur, which was known as the "Rancangan Bekalan Air Greater Kuantan Fasa II - Pakej 3 Membina dan Menyiapkan Empangan serta Kerja-kerja Berkaitan di Sungai Chereh, Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur" ('the project').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 2nd and 3rd defendants teamed up to form a joint venture known as AAY-MMN Joint Venture ('the AAY-MMN Joint Venture') in order to tender for the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> After completion of the tender documents, the AAY-MMN Joint Venture submitted its bid to the Jabatan Bekalan Air Negeri Pahang Darul Makmur in the contract sum of RM69,300,000.00. It was successful in its bid. As to who prepared the tender documents and on what terms, those were the issues between the plaintiff and the defendants. However they are not material in this appeal. They involve factual findings and the courts below had already made these findings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiff's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was the plaintiff's case that owing to its experience in the field of engineering and construction work, it was invited by the defendants to jointly participate with them in submitting a tender for the project. The plaintiff dealt with the defendants through Ng Kai Wai and Yip Kok Weng.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The plaintiff asserted in its amended statement of claim that such understanding amongst them resulted in the formation of a joint venture between them as evidenced by the pre-tender agreement it entered with the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The plaintiff claimed that under the joint venture, it was understood that it would be awarded the sub sub-contract works in the project involving a portion described in the amended statement of claim as the 'agreement on the plaintiff's portion'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Meanwhile, cl F of the pre-tender agreement provided that it would be void in the event of the 1st defendant failing to secure the main sub-contract works in the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> And as indicated above, the successful bidder for the project was the AAY-MMN Joint Venture, which was not the same as the joint venture alluded to by the plaintiff in its amended statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In its amended statement of claim, the plaintiff complained that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> However, from the evidence adduced, the 1st defendant was not awarded the main sub-contract work by the AAY-MMN Joint Venture due to disagreement on the pricing. Hence, the plaintiff was not given the sub sub-contract works.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The plaintiff also claimed in its amended statement of claim that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> And the plaintiff prayed for the following relief:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Defendants' Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Basically, the 1st and 2nd defendants denied being related companies as defined under the Act or that they had common Directors. They also denied ever inviting the plaintiff into a joint venture.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The 2nd and 3rd defendants stated that through the AAY-MMN Joint Venture, they had orally agreed to appoint the 1st defendant as a sub-contractor for the project if they succeeded in the bid and provided that the terms were agreed upon, including the pricing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The 1st defendant admitted to have requested the plaintiff to submit a quotation for the project. And it was also agreed that in the event the 1st defendant securing the sub-contract work in the project, the plaintiff would be appointed to do the structural works subject to agreed pricing, which the plaintiff should be prepared to rationalise in order to have competitive rates. However, when requested to do so, the plaintiff was unwilling to rationalise the rates and pricings for the works in the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> As a result, the 1st defendant was not awarded the main sub-contract works in the project by AAY-MMN Joint Venture. Instead, the 2nd defendant was given the main sub-contract works. In turn, cl F of the pre-tender agreement applied thereby making the agreement void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned High Court Judge heard the respective versions of the plaintiff and the defendants. In dismissing the claim of the plaintiff, the learned High Court Judge made certain findings of fact and ruled, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The Court of Appeal did not find the findings of fact by the learned High Court Judge perverse. It held that being 'a trier of fact, the findings of the learned trial judge deserves great respect. Nothing is demonstrated before us to justify our intervention either in the learned trial judge's findings of fact or her assessment or appreciation of the evidence'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The Court of Appeal also held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The learned counsel for the plaintiff summarised the leave questions to one legal issue, that is, whether contractual obligations could be frustrated or avoided by shifting responsibility from one company to another within a group of companies belonging to the same family. He elaborated by submitting that the 'question is whether in reality the group of companies' function as a single economic unit and that their separate legal character is not a reality.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The learned counsel for the plaintiff further submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In response, the learned counsel for the 1st defendant submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Meanwhile, the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant contended:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Before we specifically address the questions posed for our consideration, it is pertinent to first deal with the pleading issue in view of the submissions of the learned counsel for the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> From a perusal of the amended statement of claim, it is obvious that the plaintiff premised its claim only on the assertions that there was a joint venture between the plaintiff and the defendants and that was quite different from the AAY-MMN Joint Venture between the 2nd defendant and the 3rd defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> And it was also pleaded that arising from the joint venture, the portion of the works in the project had been earmarked for the plaintiff. It was described in the amended statement of claim as 'the agreement on the plaintiff's portion'. The plaintiff asserted that the pre-tender agreement executed between it and the 1st defendant evidenced such agreement on the plaintiff's portion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> While it was pleaded that the defendants were 'part of a group of companies managed and/or controlled by the Yip family with common/connected officers and Shareholders', there is no further assertion or claim arising therefrom in the way as submitted before us by the learned counsel for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Indeed there was no allegation in the amended statement of claim that the plaintiff was not awarded the sub sub-contract works as a result of manipulation or the abuse of the 'single' entity of the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> It is also not pleaded that in the scheme of things, the defendants and the 3rd defendant were under the dominant control of Yip Kok Weng. There was also no allegation in the amended statement of claim of fraud or equitable fraud or misrepresentation practised by the defendants upon the plaintiff during the discussion in the preparation of quotation or tender documents for the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Yet in his submission, the learned counsel for the plaintiff urged us, <i>inter alia</i>, to consider lifting the corporate veil of the defendants. Unfortunately, we find nothing in the amended statement of claim that alleged the defendants committed fraud, actual or equitable fraud upon the plaintiff. There was also no allegation that the defendants had misled the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> At best, the plaintiff merely pleaded that the 1st and 2nd defendants:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> With respect, we do not think the foregoing allegations as pleaded are sufficient as a plea for fraud or equitable fraud or to indicate special circumstances upon which, on evidence adduced, would justify the lifting of corporate veil of the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In fact, as found by the courts below and which we are inclined to agree that the thrust of the plaintiff claim against the defendants is that there was a joint venture as evidenced by the pre-tender agreement. In fact, the relief sought for by the plaintiff also shows such is the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The courts below also held and which we are also inclined to agree that the alleged joint venture did not exist and that the actual claim of the plaintiff was premised on the pre-tender agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Now, it is trite law that the plaintiff is bound by its own pleadings. (See:<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_71;"><i>R Rama Chandran v. Industrial Court Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 1 MELR 71</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_725;">[1996] 1 MLRA 725</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 145; [1997] 1 CLJ 147; [1997] 1 AMR 433, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1968_1_846;"><i>Anjalai Ammal &amp; Anor v. Abdul Kareem</i> [1968] 1 MLRA 846</LINK>; [1968] 2 MLJ 92, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_199;"><i>Gimstern Corp (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Global Insurance Co Sdn Bhd</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 199</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 302; [1987] CLJ 102, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1986_1_550;"><i>Joo Chin Kia v. Loh Seng Tek</i> [1986] 1 MLRH 550</LINK>; [1987] CLJ 662 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_226;"><i>KEP Mohamed Ali v. KEP Mohamed Ismail</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 226</LINK>; [1981] 2 MLJ 10. The plaintiff is not permitted to improve its pleading in any other manner other than by way of an application to amend. Otherwise, it would be unfair and prejudicial to the defendants if the plaintiff could now be allowed to raise an issue that was not within the contemplation of the parties in the first place. (See: <i>Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v. Southport Corp</i> [1956] AC 218 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_567;"><i>Playing Cards (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v. China Mutual Navigation Co Ltd</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 567</LINK>; [1980] 1 MLJ 122).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The learned counsel for the plaintiff urged us to lift the veil of incorporation of the defendants in order to do justice. The learned counsel submitted that only by doing so would unmask DW1, that is Yip Kok Weng, to be the real actor behind the scheme.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> With respect, we are in agreement with the finding of the Court of Appeal that the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence of fraud, actual or equitable, or of any special circumstances that would have justified lifting the veil of incorporation of the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> It is settled law that 'there must be evidence either of actual fraud or some conduct amounting to fraud in equity to justify the lifting of corporate veil'. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_526;"><i>Solid Investments Ltd v. Alcatel-Lucent (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 526</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 785; [2014] 3 CLJ 73; [2014] 1 AMR 348). Further, in a plea of fraud, mere allegations is not sufficient. There must be particulars given. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1987_1_560;"><i>Lee Kim Luang v. Lee Shiah Yee</i> [1987] 1 MLRH 560</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 193; [1988] 1 CLJ 717).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> As stated above, it is not in dispute that the 1st defendant was not awarded the sub-contract works for the project. As such, in turn, the plaintiff could not be awarded the sub sub-contract works. Accordingly, the pre-tender agreement became void pursuant to cl F thereof.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Accordingly, we agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the defendants that based on pleading issues alone, the plaintiff has no basis to seek for the lifting of the corporate veil of the defendants or to insist that there was an abuse by the defendants of the concept of corporate separate entities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In his supplementary note tendered after the completion of the hearing of this appeal, the learned counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that the 1st defendant was in breach of the pre-tender agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> With respect in its pleadings, the plaintiff only alleged that the breach was on the joint venture. Since we agree with the courts below that there was in fact no such joint venture, the issue of breach did not arise. And assuming the breach was related to the pre-tender agreement, the evidence adduced disclosed the reason for the failure of the 1st defendant to get the sub-contract works in the project. As a result, cl F applied, thereby making the pre-tender agreement void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> For the above reasons, we do not think it is necessary for us to answer the questions posed. Hence, we decline to do so. On the factual matrix of this case and based on the pleaded case of the plaintiff, our answers to those questions would serve no purpose to the plaintiff. It would then be purely an academic exercise and this court is not expected to conduct such a feat in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In the upshot, this appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
