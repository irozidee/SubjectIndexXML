    <p>The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death for trafficking in dangerous drugs, ie 1,117 grams of methamphetamine under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('DDA')</LINK> punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the same</LINK>. The appellant was arrested at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport ('KLIA'). He was pushing a trolley at the material time and the subject drugs were found concealed in an iron cylinder ('exh P9') inside a bag in the trolley. The learned judge found that the drugs were in the custody and control of the appellant and in view of the word "shall" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK>, further found that the court had no discretion but to invoke the presumption of knowledge under the said section. Having regard to the quantity and the concealment of the drugs inside exh P9, the learned judge found that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking. The appellant in defence denied any knowledge of the drugs in exh P9. He stated that he only knew of the drugs after the Police Officers opened exh P9 and showed him the drugs. He claimed that he was merely requested by a friend, one Oba, to deliver certain car spare parts, which included exh P9, to another person by the name of Moruko at Sunway Pyramid. The appellant stated that he had informed SP7 that he was to meet Moruko at Sunway Pyramid and that he was taken by SP7 and other officers to Sunway Pyramid. On the way there, SP7 had asked the appellant to call Moruko via the appellant's handphone, which the appellant did. The appellant stated that he spoke to Moruko in his native language but SP7 had scolded him and had asked him to speak in English. When the appellant started speaking in English to Moruko, Moruko began to laugh. According to the appellant, that was probably because Moruko knew that the appellant had been arrested and that Moruko had heard SP7 scolding him. When they arrived at Sunway Pyramid, the appellant tried calling Moruko again but to no avail as Moruko had switched off his handphone. The learned judge however found that the appellant failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge and therefore did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case, resulting in his conviction and death sentence. The appellant appealed and the following issues were raised for determination: (i) whether the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> had been arbitrarily invoked by the learned judge; (ii) whether an adverse inference should be drawn for the prosecution's failure to call witnesses from the intelligence team on the handphones seized from the appellant; (iii) whether the learned judge erred in finding that the appellant did not raise the defence of no knowledge; (iv) whether the learned judge erred in applying the inference of trafficking without considering <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 DDA</LINK>; and (v) whether the learned judge failed to appreciate the cautioned statement ('exh D39').</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> was not mandatory. Where the prosecution had succeeded in proving by direct evidence that the accused was in possession of the dangerous drugs, the trial judge might make a finding of fact that the accused had actual possession of the dangerous drugs without resort to the presumption of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. Based on the Federal Court cases of <i>PP v. Tan Tatt Eek &amp; Other Appeals</i>, <i>Emmanuel Yaw Teiku v. PP</i>, <i>Isidro Leonardo Quito Cruz v. PP</i> and <i>Siew Yoke Keong v. PP</i>, this court disagreed with the learned judge that the court had no discretion but to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. The learned judge might consider whether there was evidence to establish that the appellant had actual or <i>mens rea</i> possession of the dangerous drugs and if there was, as clearly enunciated in the above cases, the learned judge could make an affirmative finding of possession without having to resort to the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. (paras 18-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The appellant's defence that he had no knowledge of the subject drugs as he was merely requested by Oba to deliver the same to Moruko was consistent with exh D39, and advanced at the earliest possible opportunity to the Police Officers SP7 and SP8. The appellant claimed to have contacted Moruko upon arrival at KLIA through one of the handphones given by Oba and that he was about to board the taxi to Sunway Pyramid to meet Moruko when he was arrested. SP8, who was the Investigating Officer, confirmed that she did not investigate the handphones seized by SP7 from the appellant as the handphones had been sent to the intelligence team. No officer was called from the said team to give evidence as to what was the outcome of the investigation on the handphones. That failure to call any officers from the said team attracted an adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) Evidence Act 1950</LINK> as the evidence led on the handphones would have either confirmed or negated the appellant's defence. The appellant had complied with the <i>Alcontara</i> notice (<i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. PP</i>). It was the duty of the prosecution to investigate the defence's version, which SP8 admitted that she had not done. (paras 24-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Applying <i>Radhi'</i>s direction (<i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP</i>), the learned judge should have undertaken two separate exercises to consider whether Oba and/or Maruko were real or fictitious characters and if they were real, whether they were the real traffickers. The learned judge failed to do so. The failure to administer <i>Radhi'</i>s direction as stated in <i>Yee Wen Chin v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> amounted to a misdirection by way of non-direction. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The learned judge erred in finding that the appellant fell short of saying that he had no knowledge of the drugs. The defence was that the appellant had no knowledge of the drugs and that the drugs belonged to Moruko. SP7 confirmed in cross-examination that the appellant had wanted to go to Sunway Pyramid. Although SP7 could not remember the name "Moruko", he confirmed that the appellant had mentioned the name of the person that he was supposed to meet at Sunway Pyramid. SP8 similarly confirmed in cross-examination that the appellant had, in his cautioned statement, denied that he knew of the drugs. The learned judge failed to appreciate the cautioned statement. The cautioned statement alone could not be the basis of an acquittal. However, if the learned judge had properly appreciated the cautioned statement, which was consistent with his evidence in court and to a certain extent, with the prosecution's evidence, the learned judge would have found that the appellant had rebutted the presumption of knowledge and had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. (paras 32-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The learned judge invoked the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> to find that the appellant was in possession and had knowledge of the drugs. Recognising the rule against double presumption which was applicable then, the learned judge held that the presumption of trafficking did not apply. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">Section 2 DDA</LINK> stipulated the various acts under the definition of trafficking and the learned judge ought to have made a finding whether the appellant was trafficking by way of carrying, concealing or any other specific acts as provided thereunder. That failure to make a specific finding was a non-direction amounting to misdirection. (paras 35-36)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Emeka Promise, the appellant, was charged in the High Court at Shah Alam for trafficking in dangerous drugs, to wit 1117 grams of methamphetamine, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (the Act)</LINK> and punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the same Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Acting on information that he had received on a drug trafficking activity involving a Nigerian national, Inspector Iqbal bin Mohd Isa (SP7) and his team (who were all in plainclothes) arrested the appellant at Gate 6 of Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the time of the arrest, the appellant was pushing a trolley with a black bag (exh P6) and a blue plastic bag (exh P7) on it. The appellant was brought to the KLIA police station. A body search was conducted. Nothing incriminating was found on the appellant. In the bag exh P7, the police found car parts, among others, a car lamp (exh P8), a radiator fan (exh P23) and an iron cylinder (exh P9).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> SP7 asked the appellant what the things were for. The appellant said that they were samples for him to buy in Malaysia. SP7 was suspicious of the answer. SP7 asked the appellant whether P9 could be opened. The appellant nodded his head but did not say how to open it. SP7 then hit P9 with a hammer and there were signs that it could be opened. SP7 instructed L/K Badri bin Mohd Isa (SP3) to use a screw driver to pry open the lid of P9. SP3 did as instructed and he succeeded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> From P9, the police recovered two transparent plastic packets (exhs P16A and P16B). At this point of time, the appellant became scared. He began to shiver and sweat heavily. SP7 informed the appellant that he was a policeman and the appellant was told to cool down.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Upon analysis by the chemist, Dr Vanita a/p Kunalan (SP4), it was confirmed that exhs P16A and P16B contained 1117 grams of methamphetamine.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned trial judge found that the drugs were in the custody and control of the appellant and in view of the word "shall" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>, further found that the court had no discretion but to invoke the presumption of knowledge under the said section. Having regard to the quantity and the concealment of the drugs inside the iron cylinder exh P9, the learned trial judge found that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking. The appellant was called upon to enter his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant was a car body parts dealer and he had a company in Nigeria, dealing with the same, called Promise International Pvt Ltd. Upon the advice of his friend, Oba, who had been to Malaysia before and was aware of the Malaysian market on this trade, the appellant came to Malaysia to source for such parts. Oba had informed the appellant to meet one Moruko upon arrival at KLIA. Oba had given the appellant certain spare parts, including exh P9 to be given to Moruko.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Oba had also given the appellant two handphone SIM cards, one bearing a Malaysian number and the other, a Nigerian number. The appellant had contacted Moruko from Nigeria and was told to contact him again once the appellant arrived at KLIA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Upon arrival at KLIA, the appellant did contact Moruko using the local SIM card number that was given by Oba. Moruko told the appellant to take a taxi to Sunway Pyramid and to call him again when the appellant reached Sunway Pyramid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> After the said phone call, the appellant purchased a taxi ticket to Sunway Pyramid. The appellant had put his baggage in the taxi and was about to board the taxi outside KLIA when he was confronted by a group of plainclothes men and was subsequently arrested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In essence, the appellant denied any knowledge of the drugs in exh P9. He stated that he only knew about the drugs after the Police Officers opened P9 and showed him the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The trial judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge and had not raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The following issues were canvassed before us:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Having heard the appeal, we found that there were merits in the grounds raised by the appellant. We therefore unanimously allowed the appeal and we set aside the conviction and sentence of the High Court. The appellant was acquitted and discharged. We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Application Of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">Section 37(d) Of The Act</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The first issue was in relation to the following finding of the learned trial judge (Rekod Rayuan Jld 3: pp 260-261):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It was the submission of learned counsel that the learned trial judge had erred in applying the statutory presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> for the reason that the learned judge had deemed that he had no other choice. By invoking the statutory presumption of knowledge, learned counsel submitted that the trial judge had failed to consider the direct and circumstantial evidence presented and had raised the bar on the appellant to rebut the prosecution's case without considering the principle of "fairness of the case". Had the learned trial judge applied his mind whether <i>mens rea</i> possession could be established based on the facts and surrounding circumstances, the evidential burden on the appellant was merely to raise a reasonable doubt. In the alternative, learned counsel submitted that the trial judge had failed to consider whether the defence, on the totality of the evidence during the <i>prima facie</i> stage (including the cautioned statement), had rebutted the presumption of knowledge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We found favour in the submission of learned counsel on the first issue. In our view, the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> is not mandatory. Where the prosecution had succeeded in proving by direct evidence that the accused was in possession of the dangerous drugs, the trial judge may make a finding of fact that the accused had actual possession of the dangerous drugs without resort to the presumption of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. We found support in the following judgments of the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In the light of the above authorities, we disagreed with the learned trial judge that the court had no discretion but to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. In our view, the trial judge may consider whether there was evidence to establish that the appellant had actual or <i>mens rea</i> possession of the dangerous drugs and if there was, as clearly enunciated in the above cases, the trial judge could make an affirmative finding of possession without having to resort to the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Investigation On The Handphones</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The defence of the appellant was that he had no knowledge of the dangerous drugs in exh P9 as he was merely requested by Oba to deliver the same to Moruko. This version given under oath was consistent with the cautioned statement, exh D39 and was advanced at the earliest possible opportunity to SP7 and SP8.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It was the evidence of the appellant that upon arrival at KLIA, he had contacted Moruko through one of the handphones given by Oba and that he was about to board the taxi to Sunway Pyramid to meet Moruko when he was arrested. The handphones were seized by SP7 and the Investigating Officer, Inspector Siti Halifa binti Abd Ghofar (SP8) confirmed that she did not investigate the handphones as the handphones had been sent to 'Bahagian Risikan'. No officer from Bahagian Risikan was called to give evidence as to what was the outcome of the investigation on the handphones. It was the submission for the appellant that the failure to call the witness from Bahagian Risikan attracted the adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[26]</b> We agreed with learned counsel. In our view, it was important for the prosecution to lead evidence on the handphones as they could confirm or negate the appellant's version on the existence of Oba and Moruko and on the defence that the appellant had no knowledge of the dangerous drugs as he was merely to deliver the same to Moruko.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In this regard, it is pertinent to refer to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_382;"><i>Yee Wen Chin v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 382</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 222; [2008] 6 CLJ 773 where this court, making reference to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It was the appellant's evidence that upon being arrested, the appellant informed SP7 that he was to meet Moruko at Sunway Pyramid and that he was taken by SP7 and other officers to Sunway Pyramid. On the way there, SP7 asked the appellant to call Moruko, which the appellant did. The appellant stated that he spoke to Moruko in his native language but SP7 scolded him and had asked him to speak in English. When the appellant started speaking in English to Moruko, Moruko started laughing. According to the appellant, that was probably because Moruko knew that the appellant had been arrested and that Moruko had heard SP7 scolding the appellant. When they arrived at Sunway Pyramid, the appellant tried calling Moruko again, but the call could not get through as Moruko had switched off his handphone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We noted that the above version was denied by SP7. Be that as it may, the appellant had complied with the <i>Alcontara</i> notice. It was the duty of the prosecution to investigate the defence version, in particular the existence of Oba and Moruko from the seized handphones, which in this case, the Investigating Officer, SP8 admitted that she had not done so. Her evidence at pp 150-151 Rekod Rayuan Jld 2 was that "saya hanya dimaklumkan daripada bahagian risikan ini jawapannya negative ... Pegawai risikan yang maklumkan itu hanya kepada Insp Iqbal, Insp Iqbal maklumkan saya". Quite apart from the fact that it was not clear what "jawapannya negative" referred to, we agreed with learned counsel that this piece of evidence was hearsay and was inadmissible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Further, applying <i>Radhi'</i>s direction, the learned judge should undertake the two separate exercises to consider whether Oba and/or Maruko were real or fictitious characters and if they were real, whether they were the real traffickers. This, the learned trial judge had failed to do. In our judgment the failure of the trial judge to administer unto himself the <i>Radhi'</i>s direction as stated in <i>Yee Wen Chin (supra)</i> amounted to a misdirection by way of non-direction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Of No Knowledge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Learned counsel's complaint arose from the following finding of the learned trial judge (Rekod Rayuan Jld 3: p 266):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We found that the learned trial judge had erred in finding that the appellant fell short of saying that he had no knowledge of the drugs. As mentioned above, the defence was that the appellant had no knowledge of the drugs and that the drugs belonged to Moruko. SP7 confirmed in cross-examination that the appellant had wanted to go to Sunway Pyramid. Although SP7 could not remember the name Moruko, he confirmed that the appellant had mentioned the name of the person that he was supposed to meet at Sunway Pyramid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> SP8 similarly confirmed in cross-examination that the appellant had, in his cautioned statement, denied that he knew about the drugs. SP8 had stated (Rekod Rayuan Jld 2: pp 122-123):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Based on the above, it cannot be said that the appellant fell short of saying that he has no knowledge of the drugs. The learned trial judge had thus erred in fact in his finding, which finding was against the evidence adduced by the prosecution. In this regard we also agreed with learned counsel that the learned trial judge had failed to appreciate the cautioned statement. Although the cautioned statement alone could not be the basis of an acquittal, had the learned trial judge properly appreciated the cautioned statement which was consistent with his evidence in court and to a certain extent, with the prosecution evidence, the learned trial judge would have found that the appellant had rebutted the presumption of knowledge and had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Inference Of Trafficking</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The learned trial judge had invoked the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to find that the appellant was in possession and had knowledge of the drugs. Recognising the rule against double presumption which was applicable then, he held that the presumption of trafficking did not apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In our view, the learned trial judge ought to have applied <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> which stipulates the various acts under the definition of trafficking and ought to have made a finding whether the appellant was trafficking by way of carrying, concealing or any other specific acts as provided thereunder. The learned trial judge however did not make any reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2</LINK>. In the circumstances, we agreed with learned counsel that the learned trial judge had failed to deliberate on the specific acts under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2</LINK> which the appellant was found to be trafficking in dangerous drugs. This failure in our view is a non-direction amounting to a misdirection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Having regard to all the above, we found the conviction of the appellant unsafe. We therefore allowed the appeal and set the appellant free.</p>
