    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the High Court's dismissal of her leave application for judicial review against the respondent's decision in refusing to grant her full exemption from the repayment of an educational loan taken with the respondent. The appellant obtained her LLB degree with the University of London after pursuing a course at a local college. She claimed that the exemption from repayment which was earlier offered to students who obtained a first class honours degree, amongst whom the appellant was one, was effected through a 2003 Circular issued by the respondent, and that the respondent subsequently issued a 2005 Circular depriving her of the benefit of the full exemption in the earlier 2003 Circular.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal</p>
    <p>Per Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was no affidavit in opposition to the leave application except for the Federal Counsel's submission from the bar on matters relating to facts. As such, the court should have treated the leave application as one without any objection. If satisfied that it was not frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process of court, the court should have allowed leave for judicial review and considered the issues raised by the respondent upon a proper affidavit in opposition. In the absence of an affidavit in opposition, a preliminary objection relating to facts and law ought not be entertained as that would compromise on the integrity of the decision-making process and infringe on rules of procedure relating to affidavits. Leave as a matter of procedural fairness should be given as of right and the intricate question of justiciability should be argued on merits and allowed. (paras 11 &amp; 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The courts in Malaysia had a constitutional duty to strike out an Act of Parliament if it infringed on the constitutional framework and more importantly the constitutional guarantees offered in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. In the realm of administrative law, the courts had a constitutional duty to check on all forms of executive decision by way of judicial review when it infringed a public right, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>, etc. Any form of restriction on the role of the court by an Act of Parliament would be unconstitutional <i>per se</i>. However, the courts for purposes of good governance of the state always weigh the restrictions on the court's role and on a case-to-case basis at the particular time and era. (para 16(v))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The Malaysian approach had a wider view on justiciability unlike the English approach, which favoured an Act of Parliament. Administrative decisions of any kind having a public element could be challenged, amongst others, on the following grounds: (i) violation of fundamental rights or breach of any provision of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>; (ii) failure to conform to the statute under which it was made or exceeding the limits of authority conferred by the enabling Act; (iii) repugnant to the laws of the land; and (iv) manifest arbitrariness/unreasonableness. (para 16(vii)-(viii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The Chief Justice of Malaysia heading the apex court entrusted as the 'Supreme Policing Authority' of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>, with the assistance of his brother and sister judges, pursuant to the sacrosanct oath of office, was duty bound to ensure that constitutional functionaries performed according to the oath of office and state machinery. Also, that their agencies subscribed to the rule of law in all their deeds and actions and were readily answerable to the court on public complaints that their constitutional rights were infringed thereby entailing procedural fairness in all administrative decisions. The legitimate complaints and expectations of the public by constitutional challenges or by way of judicial reviews could not be brushed aside on the grounds of non-justiciablity when having a public law element having a direct nexus to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> and/or the fundamental guarantees provisions. (para 16(ix))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> English cases should not stand as precedent in the present case for nonjusticiability issues. The court when confronted with a complaint of the present nature was bound to hear it on merits and provide the relief concerned, if warranted so. Whilst the right to complain vested with the applicant, the relief was one relating to the jurisprudence on the rule of law and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. (para 16(x))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Arbitrariness in any decision-making process, whether by the executive or by the judiciary, was an affront to the rule of law and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. As held by HRH Raja Azlan Shah CJM (as HRH then was) in Pengarah Tanah Dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd, unfettered discretion was a contradiction in terms, and every legal power must have limits, otherwise there was dictatorship. Further, the courts were the only defence of the liberty of the subject against departmental aggression. Based on the jurisprudential approach taken in that case, every complaint of arbitrariness in a decision-making process of a public body, if on the face of record was not frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process of court, the application for leave to proceed with judicial review on merits ought to be granted. (para 16(xi)-(xii)).</p>
    <p>Per Varghese George Varughese JCA (concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The court should take a flexible approach when dealing with a leave application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN3.;;">O 53 r 3 Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. An aggrieved person had a right to seek the courts supervisory powers over decision makers and ought not to be shut out summarily. The courts' concern should not be to exclude such a complaint at the leave stage but to take a more permissible stance unless there were clear and obvious grounds to disallow the application for review applied for. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The appellant's complaint was that a decision of the respondent, a public authority, effected through the 2005 Circular deprived her of a benefit that was conferred by a previous 2003 Circular which granted exemptions to students who obtained a first class honours degree from repayment of their loan amounts due to the respondent. The appellant was without doubt a person affected by the impugned decision of the respondent. The complaint was as to its very legality, its arbitrariness and/or rationality. Those were sufficient grounds to grant leave to the appellant for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53.;;">O 53 Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. (paras 29-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Leave proceedings were intended to sieve out unwanted or frivolous applications before moving to the substantive stage of proceedings. The assistance required by the court from the Attorney General's Chambers at that stage was to appraise the court of any particular features of the case that would disqualify any leave being granted to the applicant concerned. It was not for the chambers at that preliminary stage to embark upon substantive submission on the jurisdiction of the court to entertain such an application. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The appellant sufficiently demonstrated that she was an aggrieved person affected by a decision of a governmental authority of a general public import. The complaint of the applicant was clearly susceptible to judicial review. In the circumstances, leave ought to have been granted by the court. (para 40)</p>
    <p>Per Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA (concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> A circular was an instrument enacted and permitted under statute and having a legislative effect. The decision made pursuant to the circular was capable of judicial review. The respondent's source of power in making the decision was derived from the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;;">Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional Act 1997</LINK> because the 2003 Circular was enacted under the same Act. The 2003 Circular could be characterised as an administration quasi-legislation subject to judicial review. The 2003 Circular was a public document intended to be made known to the public as it was published on the respondent's website. The circular also intended to bind students who had an education loan from the respondent. (paras 56-57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Even if the relationship between the appellant and the respondent was contractual in nature, the appellant's claim was based solely on public law. The decision by the respondent was made by a body exercising its public function on a public law matter and thus amenable to judicial review. On the facts, it was right to conclude that there was an arguable case. The learned judge was wrong in refusing to exercise his discretion to grant leave. (paras 58-40)</p>

      <b>[1]</b> The appellant appeals against the decision of learned High Court Judge who refused leave to proceed with the judicial review application based on the preliminary objection of the Attorney General Chambers (AG Chambers), on the grounds that the subject matter of the judicial review is non-justiciable. The learned High Court Judge has not provided the grounds for the decision. We heard the appeal on 11 December 2014 and reserved judgment. My learned brothers Varghese George Varughese JCA and Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA have read this judgment and agreed that the appeal must be allowed. Both my learned brothers have agreed to provide supporting judgments in the instant case. This is my judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It is important to note that the AG Chambers has not filed any affidavit in reply and the submission of facts and law by the Senior Federal Counsel on the facts of the instant case ought to have been rejected by the High Court in limine.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant, now a graduate with first class honours in LLB from University of London, pursued that degree at ATC College. To pursue the degree, the appellant was offered an education loan of RM47,875.00 by the respondent which was dispensed pursuant to a circular known as PTPTN Bilangan 1 Tahun 2002 (2002 Circular). Subsequently, the respondent had informed the appellant that her results entitled her full exemption for repayment of education loan pursuant to circular, known as Pekeliling PTPTN Bilangan 2 Tahun 2003 (2003 Circular).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The 2003 Circular in essence says that students with first class honours shall be exempted from the loan. However, if it is Institusi Pendidikan Tinggi Swasta (IPTS) students, it is limited to those who pursue courses that have obtained Certificate of Accreditation from the National Board of Accreditation (LAN). The appellant falls in the category of IPTS student. The appellant applied for exemption but was rejected. Subsequently, the respondent had informed the Public Complaints Bureau of the Prime Minister's Department that the appellant's application could not be processed because a certificate from LAN was not produced and if the certificate is produced the respondent will have no obstacle to consider the application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The appellant obtained the LAN certificate from ATC and forwarded it to the respondent. Again the respondent rejected on the ground that the LAN accreditation was from year 27 February 2006 till 26 February 2011 and degree obtained earlier did not have LAN certificate. The appellant appealed against the decision and the respondent informed that the appeal will further be submitted to "Mesyuarat Jawatankuasa Kutipan Balik Pembiayaan Pendidikan (MJKBPP)" for consideration. Finally the respondent dismissed the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellant says in the 2005 Circular that the respondent recognises that the absence of LAN certificate does not mean the courses provided by the private colleges are not approved by LAN and the loan application can still be made so long as they are made before 1 July 2006. In the instant case, LAN certificate was issued to ATC on 27 February 2006 and has met with the deadline set in the 2005 Circular.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the issue of justiciability inter alia the appellant submits as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant's complaint is that the 2003 Circular does not state when the accreditation must be obtained and it was wrong for the respondent to interpret it to include the words 'during the time the appellant was undergoing her studies'. The appellant says, the interpretation is inconsistent with public policy, the 2002 Circular and Surat Pekeliling PTPTN Bilangan 1 Tahun 2005 (2005) circulars and in consequence the decision is irrational and unreasonable. In addition, the appellant says that there was a legitimate expectation that the respondent would not renege on its previous policy and that the appellant would be given an opportunity to be heard before the decision was made and relies on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_3_313;"><i>YAM Tunku Dato' Seri Nadzaruddin Ibni Tuanku Ja'afar v.

    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant asserts that based on the decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_524;"><i>Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri v. Pengarah Kebudayaan &amp; Kesenian Johor &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 524</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 145; [2010] 5 CLJ 865, the decision is amenable to judicial review as it contains sufficient element of public law and the Federal Court had stated to determine whether it has sufficient element of public law 'it is necessary to examine both the source of power and the nature of the decision made'. And says that:</p>

      <b>Federal Counsel Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The learned Federal Counsel says, (i) the relationship between the appellant arises out of a contract; (ii) 2003 Circular has no legislative effect and is administrative in nature. The circular was not issued based on <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;;">Akta Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional 1997</LINK>; (iii) the policy made by the respondent in its administration is not justiciable; (iv) there is nondisclosure of material facts and evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> As I said earlier, the learned Federal Counsel was submitting from the bar on matters relating to facts without an affidavit in opposition to the leave application. In consequence, the court should have treated the leave application as one without any objection and if it is satisfied that it is not frivolous or vexations or abuse of process of court, it should have allowed the leave for judicial review and considered the issues raised by the Federal Counsel upon proper affidavit in opposition filed by the respondent and the case ought to have been heard on merits. When there is no affidavit in opposition, preliminary objection relating to facts and law ought not be entertained as it will compromise the integrity of decision making process as well as infringe on rules of procedure relating to affidavits. It must be noted that the issue of policy may be non-justiciable but the implementation of the policy may be justiciable if it affects the interest of a member of the public and if it breaches constitutional safe guards. The court then will have a duty to hear the complaint as of right.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The instant case rests on whether the matter is justiciable and on the facts of the case and whether the issue can be determined at leave stage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To Concept Of Justiciability</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The word justiciability was considered by the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_109;"><i>Petaling Tin Bhd v. Lee Kian Chan &amp; Ors</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 109</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 657; [1994] 2 CLJ 346; [1993] 2 AMR 3503 and Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ in reliance of <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Based on the Supreme Court's decision, the threshold to determine justiciability is extremely low and in cases relating to leave for judicial review where there is no affidavit in opposition, leave as a matter of procedural fairness should be given as of right and allow the intricate question of justiciability to be argued on merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The issue of justiciability in an application for leave for judicial review was considered in great detail by Justice Mohamed Ariff Md Yusof (as he then was) on an <i>inter parte</i> basis in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_11_277;"><i>Tengku Muhammad Fakhry Petra Ibni Sultan Ismail Petra v. Yang Maha Mulia Pemangku Raja Kelantan &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 11 MLRH 277</LINK> and held that leave as a general rule will only be refused where an application is (i) frivolous and vexatious and hopeless; (ii) made by busybodies with misguided or trivial complaints of administrative errors; (iii) misconceived; (iv) unarguable or groundless; (v) where there is more appropriate alternative procedure; (vi) where an application for judicial review is inappropriate. The learned judge in setting out the general principles had dealt with a number of cases. To name a few are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned judge in that case had also dealt extensively with the concept of justiciability and came to the conclusion that on the facts the application did not merit leave to be granted. I do not propose to repeat the cases dealt in that case save to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> For reasons stated above, I take the view the appeal must be allowed with no order as to costs. The judgment of the High Court is set aside. Leave for judicial review is granted and the application for judicial review is to be heard on its merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> I hereby order so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of my learned brother Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA in draft. I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by my learned brother that the appeal before us ought to be allowed and leave be granted to the appellant/applicant (applicant) to take the substantive judicial review action to its next stage of proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53.;;">O 53 of Rules of Court 2012 ("ROC 2012")</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The essential facts surrounding the grievance of the applicant in this case has been set out in the judgment of my learned brother Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA. I do not intend to repeat the same here save where some further emphasis is called for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On my part the court should take a flexible approach when dealing with a leave application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN3.;;">O 53 r 3 ROC 2012</LINK>. If the applicant can <i>prima facie</i> satisfy that he is a person affected by a decision of a quasi-judicial or administrative nature or made by a public body, the simple question that the court should ask is only this - Why should leave not be granted?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The premise underlying this approach is that an aggrieved person in such circumstances has a right to seek the court's supervisory powers over decision makers and ought not to be shut out summarily. In other words the court's concern should not be to exclude such a complaint at this leave stage but to take a more permissible stance unless there are clear and obvious grounds to disallow the review applied for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In that context it has also to be borne in mind that the role of the Hon'ble Attorney General's Chambers to assist the court (under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN3.;;">O 53 r 3(3) ROC 2012</LINK>) should necessarily have to be rather limited at this stage (elaborated further in these grounds). The door, it must also be remembered, is always open to the court to even have the leave application heard <i>inter parte</i> (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN8.;;">O 53 r 8 ROC 2012</LINK>) (also elaborated further in these grounds).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> This is not a new approach. It had been adverted to by Mohamad Ariff J (as His Lordship then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_11_277;"><i>Tengku Muhammad Fakhry Petra Ibni Sultan Ismail Petra v. Yang Maha Mulia Pemangku Raja Kelantan &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 11 MLRH 277</LINK>. It was observed in the judgment there as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_516;"><i>QSR Brands Bhd v. Suruhanjaya Sekuriti &amp; Anor</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 516</LINK>; [2006] 3 MLJ 164; [2006] 2 CLJ 532; [2006] 3 AMR 320 speaking through Gopal Sri Ram JCA after noting (at p 517) that the '... sole question at the leave stage is whether the application is frivolous', went on to quote the Court of Appeal in another decision as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>[26]</b> In the QSR Brands case, this court went on further to state:</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(On the facts, it was found in that case that the applicant lacked a sufficient personal interest in the legality of the impugned action and it was not in any event a public interest litigation but a private interest litigation, wholly outside any of the envisaged spectrum).</p>

Tun Dato' Seri Ahmad Fairuz &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 197</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 490; [2012] 1 CLJ 805 after setting out <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN2.;;">O 53 r 2</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN3.;;">r 3 ROC 2012</LINK> emphatically affirmed the guiding principles to be applied at the leave stage as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(In that case, leave was refused on the grounds that the 'findings' and 'recommendations' of the Royal Commission was not a 'decision' and further on policy consideration, such findings and recommendations were not reviewable by the courts.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Applying the above principles to the facts at hand in this case, the applicant here was definitely not a busy body. The application for intervention of the court was not on first sight frivolous or vexatious either. Her complaint was that a decision of PTPTN, a public authority, effected through a circular, namely the 2005 Circular (meant to have effect retrospectively) had deprived her of a benefit that had been conferred by a previous 2003 Circular which had granted an exemption to students who obtained first class honours from repayment of their loans amounts due to PTPTN.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Counsel for the applicant contended that the Circulars issued by PTPTN were issued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;19.;;">s 19</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;49.;;">s 49 of the Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional Act 1997</LINK>. Whether the contents of the Circulars had the status of an 'administrative' directive or was in the nature of a 'quasi-legislative order' was not material at this leave stage. What was pertinent for consideration was that there was a 'decision' made by a public body which had been conveyed to the applicant, the effect of which decision, impinged upon her rights and interest; the 'decision' had the force of law behind it namely that it was binding upon PTPTN and the applicant in so far as their relationship and mutual obligations were concerned. Further that 'decision' had a wider public/administrative impact beyond the applicant personally as well.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In my considered view, the applicant was without doubt a person affected by the impugned 'decision' of PTPTN. The complaint was as to it's very legality, its arbitrariness and/or rationality. These were sufficient to grant leave to the applicant to pursue and progress the judicial review process further as allowed for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53.;;">O 53 of the ROC 2012</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Federal Counsel representing the Honourable Attorney General at the hearing of the leave application contended that the relationship as between the Applicant and PTPTN was basically contractual in nature and disputes arising therefrom were not amenable to judicial review. The short answer to that is to be found in the judgment of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_524;"><i>Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri v. Pengarah Kebudayaan &amp; Kesenian Johor &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 524</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 145; [2010] 5 CLJ 865 in the following passages:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and at:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In the Singapore High Court case of <i>UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v. Jurong Town Corp</i> [2011] SGHC 45, the court with respect to how a leave application for judicial review ought to be dealt with, noted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The court went on to state that it was appropriate for the court to consider at the leave stage whether the decision was, as the court framed it, susceptible to judicial review but in that respect the court went on to observe:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In the instant case before us, we do not have the benefit of the grounds for the decision of the learned High Court Judge who had refused the grant of leave to the applicant. Although, as noted by my learned brother Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA, there was no affidavit filed, there was, as it would appear, written submission filed by the Federal Counsel appearing for the Attorney General.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> This then brings me to the significance of the Hon'ble Attorney General's input at the leave stage of a judicial review application. It is trite that the 'leave' proceedings are intended to sieve out unwanted or frivolous applications before it moves to the substantive stage of proceedings. The assistance required by the court from the Attorney General's Chambers at this stage, in that context, was to appraise the court of any particular features of the case that would disqualify any leave being granted to the applicant concerned. It was not for the Chambers at this preliminary stage, in my view, to embark upon substantive submission on the jurisdiction of the court to entertain such an application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> I would venture to add that issues such as whether the 'decision' was a policy or discretionary matter or that the subject matter was non-justiciable or that an alternative remedy was available, and such like, should properly be determined when the putative respondent had been served with all papers and the direct parties are fully heard by the court. It might well be that the Chambers of the Hon'ble Attorney General would eventually represent the putative respondent. The Chambers should however not jump the gun by embarking upon a preemptive strike to dismiss the complaint at such a preliminary stage, unless of course the acts/decision was inherently not susceptible to judicial review, like where the law was ill-suited to deal with an issue of 'Royal succession' as was the situation in <i>Tengku Muhamad Fakhry Petra'</i>s case (within the realm of another forum) or where there was no 'decision' as such, as was the case in the Royal Commission case referred above (only findings and recommendations).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The role of the Honourable Attorney General's Chambers at the leave stage was therefore only to bring to the court's attention any features surrounding that particular complaint that need to be taken into consideration by the court before the leave applied for was granted or refused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In the event the court before whom the leave application was being heard had still any doubts, as regards non-justiciability or on other grounds, the better course would be for the court to invite the putative respondent to address the court on that point even at that leave stage. This the court was clearly empowered to do under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN8.;;">O 53 r 8 of the ROC 2012</LINK>. This approach to have the leave application heard <i>inter parte</i> was opted for by the court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2012_3_199;"><i>Zakaria Abdullah &amp; Ors v. Lembaga Perlesenan Tenaga Atom &amp; Ors</i> [2012] 3 MLRH 199</LINK> and also in the <i>Tengku Muhamad Fakhry Petra'</i>s case. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_477;"><i>Advance Synergy Capital Sdn Bhd v. The Minister Of Finance, Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 477</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 376, this court had held that the word 'application' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN8.;;">O 53 r 8(1)</LINK> would cumulatively cover the two stages of the proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> A genuinely aggrieved person who has been adversely affected by a 'decision' which fell into a 'grey' area, so to speak, that is, where amenability to judicial review was in doubt if at all, ought to be heard before she or he was shut out from the supervisory jurisdiction of the court. The court should opt for such a course in those circumstances rather than refuse leave outright.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In this case however, the applicant before us had sufficiently demonstrated that she was not a 'busy-body', her grievance was not frivolous, her seeking for court's intervention was not unarguable or misconceived and it involved a 'decision' of a governmental authority of a general public import. The complaint of the applicant was clearly susceptible to judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In the circumstances, leave ought to have been granted by the court to progress the judicial review application to its substantive stage. I agree with my learned brothers therefore that the appeal be allowed.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The appellant, now a graduate with first class honours in LLB from University of London, having pursued that degree at ATC College.

The appellant in her application seeks this court intervention to declare that the narrow interpretation of 'Pekeliling PTPTN Bil 2 Tahun 2003' as not being fair and to move this court to interpret and to include the appellant within the scope of the 'Pekeliling'. The requirement and condition imposed in the 'Pekeliling' is within the policy making process of the respondent to determine its applicability. The related prayers in this application are not justiciable for judicial review because it involves a challenge against policy consideration in which for this matter, it is totally within the best knowledge of the respondent to determine.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The stands taken for the appellant are that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The appellant submitted that the decision is justiciable and amenable for judicial review because it contains sufficient elements of public law for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The issue that needs to be determined in the instant appeal is whether the executive's discretion, whether by statute or prerogative is amenable to judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> In my view, the 2003 Circular is made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;19.;;">s 19</LINK> and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;20.;;">s 20 of the PTPTN Act</LINK> which authorised both the Minister and Perbadanan to enact the said Circular. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2013_6_593;"><i>Laguna De Bay Sdn Bhd v. Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya</i> [2013] 6 MLRH 593</LINK>; [2013] 9 CLJ 899 the applicant was challenging a decision made pursuant to a circular issued by the Selangor State Secretary relating to the construction of billboards. Judicial review was allowed and it was held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The provision in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;9.;;">s 9 of the LGA</LINK> is similar to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;19.;;">s 19 of the PTPTN Act</LINK>. The court in <i>Laguna De Bay</i> recognises that a circular is an instrument enacted and permitted under statute and has legislative effect. As such, the decision made pursuant to the circular was capable of judicial review or is an issue to be canvassed on the full hearing of judicial review.</p>
    <p>Hence, I agree that the respondent's source of power in making the decision derives ultimately from the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;;">PTPTN Act</LINK> because the 2003 Circular was enacted under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_566;;">PTPTN Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The 2003 Circular can be characterised as an administration quasilegislation which are subject to judicial review. The 2003 Circular is a public document and is intended to be made known to the public. This can be seen where the same was published on the respondent's website. The 2003 Circular was also intended to bind the students who had an education loan from the respondent and the respondent itself. If the 2003 Circular was not intended to bind the public, the respondent would not have made the decision, however wrong, by referring or relying to the 2003 Circular. When an instrument has 'force of law', it is regarded as a subsidiary legislation and is binding on the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> The respondent also put in argument that the relationship between the appellant and the respondent was contractual in nature and therefore is regulated by private law. Reference is made to the Federal Court's decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_524;"><i>Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri v. Pengarah Kebudayaan &amp; Kesenian Johor &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 524</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 145; [2010] 5 CLJ 865, where it was held that even though the relationship between the appellant and respondent is contractual in nature, the Federal Court found that the appellant's claim was based solely on public law. The Federal Court held and I quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Thus, the decision by the respondent was made under a statutory law by a body who acted within the scope of such statutory power. 2003 Circular gives rights to individuals to obtain waiver and imposes obligations on the public authority to grant the waiver.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> As stated in the case of <i>Tang Kwor Ham &amp; Ors v. Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd &amp; Ors</i> at the leave stage, merits of the case shouldn't be considered and the test to grant leave would be whether the case is arguable and it is not frivolous. In the instant appeal, the decision by the respondent was made by a body exercising its public function on a public law matter and thus amenable for judicial review. On the facts, it was right to conclude that there was an arguable case. The learned judge was wrong in refusing to exercise his discretion in granting leave.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1987_2_134;"><i>George John v. Goh Eng Wah Bros Filem Sdn Bhd &amp; 2 Ors</i> [1987] 2 MLRH 134</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 319, His Lordship Lim Beng Choon J, with whom I agree described in crisp language the approach the court should take at the leave stage where he said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> I find that this threshold has been met by the appellant. Whilst we are unanimous in allowing the appeal, I take the view the appeal should be confined to the sole issue of whether leave for judicial review should have been granted or not. As I adopt that stand, I am therefore constrained to encapsulate my views in a separate grounds of judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> As a matter of observation, I note that there is a growing trend to deal with applications for leave for judicial review on an <i>inter parte</i> basis although the rules, be it the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;;">1980 Rules of High Court</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;;">Rules of Court 2012</LINK> provide that such an application shall be made <i>ex parte</i>, although the cause papers are to be served on the Attorney General. It is perhaps opportune to remind ourselves of the dictum of His Lordship Edgar Joseph Jr (as he then was) in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_536;"><i>Tuan Sarip Hamid &amp; Anor v. Patco Malaysia Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 536</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 442; [1995] 3 CLJ 627 the decision of the Supreme Court, at p 540 of the judgment, where His Lordship quoted with approval the case of <i>R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, <i>ex parte</i> Rukshanda Begum</i> [1990] COD 107, as to the approach to be taken for leave for judicial review and I quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It would follow therefore that an application for leave as a norm should be dealt with on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, save and except for the exceptions set out in that portion of the judgment referred to aforesaid and where the circumstances of the case require the presence of the respondent. However that should be an exception rather than the norm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> For reasons stated above, I take the view the appeal must be allowed with no order as to costs. The judgment of the High Court is set aside. Leave for judicial review is granted and the application for judicial review is to be heard on its merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> I hereby so order.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
