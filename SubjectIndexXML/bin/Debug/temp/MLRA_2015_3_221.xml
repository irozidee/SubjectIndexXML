    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death by the High Court judge ('judge') for the offence of trafficking in 265.61 grams of dangerous drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('DDA')</LINK>. The offence had taken place in front of a hotel in Johor Bahru. The appellant was found sitting alone in the driver's seat of a car and had a white plastic bag, which was later found to contain the dangerous drugs, on his lap. The appellant had also attempted to flee when a police officer approached him. In his defence, the appellant claimed that the white plastic bag belonged to Noi, a lady friend who had asked him for a lift home. He claimed that Noi had asked him to stop by the hotel to collect some money from her boyfriend, Yusof, and that at the material time she had gone up to the hotel. He denied having knowledge of the contents in the white plastic bag or that it belonged to him. The appellant however had not mentioned "Noi" or "Yusof" in his statement to the police. The Court of Appeal affirmed the appellant's conviction and sentence on appeal. Hence, the appellant now appealed to the Federal Court on two main grounds: (i) that the Court of Appeal failed to recognise that the judge erred in his approach to the statutory presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK>; and (ii) that the judge erred in law when he criticised the appellant for remaining silent in his cautioned statement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was nothing to prevent the judge from analysing all the alternatives available to him under the DDA. The judge did not breach the rule on double presumption by taking into consideration the various alternatives in the reservoir of choices or alternatives available to him to determine the culpability of the appellant. He considered those alternatives when considering whether to invoke the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> or alternatively under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) DDA</LINK>. There was nothing to show that he erred by invoking both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) and (da)</LINK> as envisaged in <i>Muhammed Hassan v. PP</i>. The application of legal principles to the facts of this case was sufficiently appreciated, applied and well ascertained by the judge. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was overwhelming evidence to prove that the appellant was in possession of the dangerous drugs. Apart from finding that custody and control were established as the drugs were found on his lap, the appellant also had the <i>mens rea</i> possession. The unequivocal positive finding of possession was made independent of the statutory presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK>. The totality of the evidence reasonably supported the conclusion that the appellant was in actual possession of the dangerous drugs at the time of his arrest. (paras 28-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was no merit to the allegation that the judge erred in ruling that there was <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) DDA</LINK> when his grounds of judgment showed that he did not rule as such. (paras 30-33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In view of the overwhelming nature of the evidence adduced against the appellant, his defence of mere denial and the application of the <i>ratio</i> in <i>Andy Bagindah v. PP</i>, the circumstances of the case did not warrant the learned judge to undertake a separate exercise to rule whether the appellant rebutted the presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) and (da) DDA</LINK>. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> No adverse inference should be drawn against the appellant for remaining silent upon his arrest. The appellant did not have any duty to disclose his defence and was entitled to remain silent after his arrest and when his cautioned statement was recorded. Similarly no adverse inference was to be drawn against the appellant for remaining silent for not disclosing his defence. However, his silence would entitle the judge to give whatever weight considered appropriate. (para 48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> By commenting on the failure of the appellant to provide all relevant information regarding "Noi" to the police at the time of his arrest or when his cautioned statement was recorded four days after his arrest did not mean that the judge imposed a duty on the appellant to speak or disclose information on "Noi". The judge did not draw any adverse inference against the appellant. His comments on the non-disclosure of Noi's role merely went to show the weight attached to the appellant's defence. (para 50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The failure of the appellant to inform the police through his cautioned statement could be taken into account by the judge in attaching weight to his defence. "Noi" was a nickname and without giving any particulars of "Noi", it would be impossible for the police to conduct any investigation on her whereabouts and her very existence and to her role, if any, in relation to the drugs found on the lap of the appellant. Hence, the judge was entitled to disbelieve the defence story. (para 52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Based on the evidence, the appellant failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. (para 57)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged for trafficking in 265.61 grams of drugs comprising 70.20 grams of heroin and 195.41 grams of monoacetylmorphines in front of Hotel Desa Jaya, Jalan Permatang 5, Taman Desa Jaya, Ulu Tiram in the District of Johor Bahru in the State of Johor Darul Ta'zim on 2nd May, 2002 at 4.30pm an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('Act')</LINK> punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the end of the defence case the appellant failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case and was found guilty as charged by the learned High Court Judge and sentenced to death. His ensuing appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed hence this appeal to the Federal Court of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Relevant Facts Of The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The facts of the prosecution's case relevant to this appeal are as follows. Upon receiving information of a drug trafficking activity, PW5, Chief Inspector Arsad bin Kamaruddin, conducted a briefing pertaining to the said matter to some 10 police personnel at Ibu Pejabat Polis Kontinjen, Johor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> After the briefing, PW5 led the police party to Hotel Desa Jaya, Jalan Pematang 5, Taman Desa Jaya, Ulu Tiram, Johor Bahru ('the scene'). On arrival they saw a car bearing registration number JGK 9479 ('the car') parked on the side of the road in front of Hotel Desa Jaya. The appellant was seen sitting alone inside the car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The police party then closed in by obstructing the car at both ends with their vehicles. Whilst the front part of the car was blocked by a van carrying the first group of police personnel, the rear of the car was blocked by the second group of police officers in their 'Kancil car'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> PW6, Corporal Mohamad bin Suleiman and Lance Corporal Mohd Azmi proceeded to the right front door of the car while PW5 went to the left side of the front door. PW5 identified himself to the appellant by showing to the appellant his authority card.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The car attempted to flee from the scene by reversing but was impeded as it crashed into the police car which was blocking it at the rear end. It was also the prosecution's case that the appellant attempted to flee by opening the driver's door but was prevented from so doing by PW6.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> PW5 entered the car from the front passenger door and switched off the car engine and forthwith seized the ignition key.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the lap of the appellant, PW5 found a white plastic bag (P9). This testimony was confirmed by PW6.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Inside P9 was a paper box containing five translucent plastic packets containing yellowish granular and powdery substance, which, upon analysis by the Government Chemist, PW9, Abdullah bin Mohd Yusof, confirmed that the substance contained 70.20 grams of heroin and 195.41 grams of monoacetylmorphines the subject matter of this charge. Learned counsel for the appellant did not even cross-examine let alone challenge the testimony of PW9.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> With regard to the car, PW3, Ng Kim Meng and PW4, Ng Zeng Sheng testified that the appellant rented it from their hire car company, Syarikat Daite Transport, at about 1.15pm on 2 May 2002, the day of the incident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Case For The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case, the learned High Court Judge found that the prosecution had established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant and called upon the appellant to enter his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant elected to give evidence on oath and was the sole witness for the defence. In his defence, the appellant adduced, <i>inter alia</i>, the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It is pertinent to observe here that there was no mention of the names of 'Noi' or 'Yusof ' in the appellant's statement to the police. The appellant did not even know the real name of 'Noi' except that he knows that 'Noi' works at "Cafe Two". The appellant neither knew the full name of 'Yusof ' nor his full address.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> At p 82 Appeal Record, the learned High Court Judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(Note: Emphasis Added to indicate the context within which the learned trial judge used those expressions which counsel for the appellant alleged to have invoked both statutory presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">ss 37(da)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">37(d) Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> At p 87 of the Appeal Record, the learned trial judge continued:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> At the last paragraph of p 88 of the Appeal Record, the learned trial judge questioned the assertion of ignorance by the appellant when he opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned trial judge was left in no doubt of the guilt of the appellant when he ended his judgment in the penultimate paragraph of p 89 of the Appeal Record by saying:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In the ensuing appeal to the Court of Appeal, the appellate court could not agree with the arguments of learned counsel. The Court of Appeal found that "the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming with the bagful of drugs on his lap, the appellant was driving alone and the evidence are as affirmative as the facts in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337. The appellant's reaction of attempting to flee was also affirmative evidence similar to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The Court of Appeal found that there was no miscarriage of justice and dismissed the appeal. The conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge were therefore affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Appeal To The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Not known for being a filibuster, counsel for the appellant, Mr Hisyam Teh Poh Teik only canvassed two main grounds why the conviction of the appellant for drug trafficking could not stand and they are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We will deal with these two grounds in turn.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We shall deal with all the issues raised in the first ground together. Learned counsel pummeled that the learned trial judge misdirected himself when on the facts, he invoked the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> presumption and in the alternative the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> presumption. He argued that this is because for the former to apply there must be an affirmative finding of possession whilst in the case of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>, it is "deemed possession".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The other complaint of counsel was that there was no direct evidence of trafficking and it was stated as much by the learned trial judge. However it could be seen that the learned trial judge qualified his earlier statement when he continued in the very next sentence at the last paragraph of p 84 of the Appeal Record by saying:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It was also contended that the learned trial judge misdirected himself when "he invoked the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK> presumption and in the alternative the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> presumption."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> A careful reading of the judgment of the learned trial judge reveals that the learned judge was fully aware of the danger of breaching the rule of double presumption when he said in no uncertain term that "the invocation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> precluded the invocation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK>". Furthermore, the <i>ratio</i> in <link HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_311;"><i>Muhammed Hassan v. Public Prosecutor </i>[1997] 2 MLRA 311</link>; [1998] 2 MLJ 273; [1998] 2 CLJ 170; [1998] 1 AMR 829 in effect, only says that, one cannot rely on the presumption of possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK> to invoke a further presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. In other words, <i>Muhammed Hassan</i> only prohibits the use of double presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">ss 37(d)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">37(da) of the Act</LINK>. Contrary to the argument of the counsel, there is nothing to prevent the learned trial judge from analysing all the alternatives available to him under the Act. The learned trial judge has not breached the rule of double presumptions by taking into consideration the various alternatives in the reservoir of choices or alternatives available to him to determine the culpability of the appellant. Judges may expatiate on the various alternatives available without the need to incur the obloquy of counsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We observe that the learned judge was considering those alternatives when he considered whether to invoke the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> or alternatively under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. There was nothing in the grounds of judgment to show that the learned trial judge fell into error by invoking both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">ss 37(d)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">37(da)</LINK> as envisaged in <i>Muhammed Hassan (supra)</i>. We are satisfied that the application of legal principles to the facts of this case had sufficiently been appreciated, applied, and well ascertained by the learned trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> An important issue is whether the appellant was in possession of the drugs, ie was he in physical possession of the impugned drugs and knew what he was possessing. The learned trial judge had, at p 82 of the Appeal Record affirmatively found that the appellant was in possession of 70.20 grams of heroin and 195.45 grams of monoacetylmorphines. In our judgment there was overwhelming evidence to prove that the appellant was indeed in possession of the drugs. The learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We find no flaw in the above argument and agree with the finding that apart from being satisfied that the custody and control had been established as the drugs were found on his lap, he also had <i>mens rea</i> possession. It can be seen that the unequivocal positive finding of possession was made independent of the statutory presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Act</LINK>. The totality of the evidence reasonably supports the conclusion made that the appellant was in actual possession of the prescribed drugs at the time of his arrest in the car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The third point raised by learned counsel on the first ground of appeal relates to the astonishing allegation that the learned trial judge erred when he ruled that there was <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK>. We have sieved through the grounds of judgment but failed to find anywhere to substantiate such allegation. The exact words used by learned counsel in his written submission are reproduced below <i>in toto</i>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On the contrary, the learned trial judge at pp 84-85 of the Appeal Record said, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> At pp 85-86 of the Appeal Record the learned trial judge said further:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It is obvious therefore that the learned trial judge did not rule that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case of trafficking based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d)</LINK> as alleged. There is no merit in the appeal under the third heading of the first ground of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Last but not least was the allegation that the learned trial judge erred when he failed to make a finding whether the defence had rebutted the presumptions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">ss 37(da)</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">37(d) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It is clear from pp 84-86 of the Appeal Record that the learned trial judge had made a finding of actual <i>mens rea</i> possession and invoked the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> in order to call upon the appellant to enter his defence. Alternatively, the learned trial judge held that a case of presumed possession could also be made out from the fact that the prescribed drugs were found on his lap, that is to say, in the physical custody and control of the appellant. In view of the large quantity of drugs, almost two kilograms, were found on the appellant's lap and applying the principle in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_283;"><i>Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor And Another Appeal</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 283</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 64, a case of actual trafficking could be made out against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In <i>Ong Ah Chuan</i>, Lord Diplock at p 294 said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> At p 89 of the Appeal Record, the learned trial judge held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We agree with the submission of the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor that the plain reading of the above paragraph would suggest that the learned trial judge was of the view that the appellant's defence did not raise any reasonable doubt on the issue of possession thus leaving the prosecution's case intact.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> On the issue of presumed trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>, the Court of Appeal held at p 5 of Supplementary Appeal Record that the sentence "The <i>prima facie</i> case remained intact ..." carries the same meaning as the prosecution's case remained unrebutted." The evidence against the appellant is overwhelming. With the bagful of drugs on his lap and that the appellant was driving alone, the evidence analogically are as affirmative as the facts in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337. The appellant's reaction of attempting to flee is also an affirmative evidence, similar to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_763;"><i>Parlan Dadeh v. PP</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 19; [2009] 1 CLJ 717. We do not find any plausible reason to disagree with what had been held by the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> A similar issue as to the trial judge's failure to consider, as a separate exercise, whether the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> had been rebutted was considered by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_299;"><i>Andy Bagindah v. PP</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 299</LINK>; [2000] 3 MLJ 644; [2000] 3 CLJ 289; [2000] 3 AMR 2611. Shaik Daud Ismail JCA speaking for the court at p 299 said:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Likewise in the instant case, the appellant's defence is of mere denial. There is overwhelming evidence that the appellant had custody and control of the drugs and had <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs. The drugs were found on his lap. This fact was challenged by the defence whose version was that the white plastic bag was recovered from the foot well of the front passenger's seat. However, PW5 and PW6 were consistent in their evidence when they testified that the white plastic bag was found on the lap of the appellant. The learned trial judge found that both PW5 and PW6 were firm and unshaken on that critical fact and that there was no reason to disbelieve them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The testimonies of PW5 and PW6 were further corroborated by P12, the Search List which confirmed that the white plastic bag containing the drug was recovered from the appellant's lap. In a gist there was consistency as to where the drugs were found. The appellant's cautioned statement D17 recorded four days after his arrest was silent on this issue. The learned trial judge was therefore entitled to believe the prosecution's version of where the drugs were recovered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In view of the overwhelming nature of the evidence adduced against the appellant, and that his defence was of mere denial, and applying the ratio in <i>Andy Bagindah (supra)</i>, the circumstances of the instant case did not warrant the learned trial judge to undertake a separate exercise to rule whether the appellant had rebutted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">ss 37(da)</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">37(d)</LINK> presumptions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> As such this first part of the appeal is undoubtedly without any merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground Two: That The Learned Trial Judge Misdirected Himself When He Criticised The Appellant For Remaining Silent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> This ground of appeal relates to the learned trial judge's criticism of the appellant for not disclosing the role of the lady "Noi" in his cautioned statement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Learned counsel alleged that the criticism could be found at pp 87 and 88 of the Appeal Record. The learned trial judge had said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Learned counsel submitted that it is trite law that an accused person charged under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK> can elect to remain silent in his cautioned statement and quoted the cases of <link HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_599;"><i>Teng Boon How v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 599</link>; [1993] 3 MLJ 553; [1993] 4 CLJ 545; [1993] 2 AMR 3333, <link HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_47;"><i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 47</link>; [1996] 1 MLJ 209; [1996] 1 CLJ 705; [1996] 1 AMR 817 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_732;"><i>Mohd Hazrin Md Sari v. PP</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 732</LINK>; [2008] 3 MLJ 798; [2008] 5 CLJ 361.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> We appreciate that no adverse inference may be drawn against the appellant for remaining silent upon his arrest. The appellant does not have any duty to disclose his defence and entitled to remain silent after his arrest and when his cautioned statement was recorded. Similarly no adverse inference is to be drawn against the appellant for remaining silent for not disclosing his defence. However, his silence would entitle the learned trial judge to give whatever weight considered appropriate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Lim Beng Choon J in <link HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1987_2_541;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Badrulsham Bin Baharom</i> [1987] 2 MLRH 541</link>; [1988] 2 MLJ 585 at p 548 said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> By commenting on the failure of the appellant to provide all relevant information regarding "Noi" to the police at the time of his arrest or when his cautioned statement was recorded four days after his arrest does not mean that the learned trial judge had imposed a duty on the appellant to speak or disclose any information on "Noi". We do not perceive from the grounds of judgment of the learned trial judge that he had drawn any adverse inference against the appellant. To us his comments on the non disclosure of "Noi's" role merely go to show to the weight that was attached to the appellant's defence. (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_369;"><i>Teng Howe Sing v. PP</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 369</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 46; [2009] 3 CLJ 733).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin FCJ (as he then was) said at p 379 of <i>Teng Howe Sing</i>'s case:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Similarly in the instant case, the failure of the appellant to inform the police through his cautioned statement could be taken into account by the learned trial judge in attaching weight to his defence. Obviously "Noi" is a nickname and without giving any particulars of "Noi", it would be impossible for the police to conduct any investigation on her whereabout and indeed her very existence and to her role, if any, in relation to the drugs found on the lap of the appellant. Hence, the learned trial judge was entitled to disbelieve the defence story.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The learned trial judge had in fact further deliberated on the story of the defence when he said at p 88 of the Appeal Record:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Edgar Joseph Jr J had occasion to consider this point in the High Court case of <link HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1984_2_551;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Tan Gong Wai &amp; Anor</i> [1984] 2 MLRH 551</link>; [1985] 1 MLJ 355. He said at p 560:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> On this issue, we agree with the Court of Appeal when it held at p 10 of the Supplementary Appeal Record as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Consequently, the second ground of appeal is also clearly without any merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> After a careful and a robust scrutiny we are left with no doubt that the appellant has failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision and sentence of the learned High Court Judge which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. Appeal is dismissed.</p>
