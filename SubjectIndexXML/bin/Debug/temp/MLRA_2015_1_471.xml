    <p>Travelsight (M) Sdn Bhd ('Travelsight') entered into an agreement to purchase a property with Atlas Corporation Sdn Bhd ('Atlas') on 15 March 1996. Travelsight made part payment and then with the property as security, obtained financing from the bank for the balance. By a deed of assignment, Travelsight absolutely assigned its rights, interests and title in the property to the bank. By letter dated 2 April 1997, Atlas confirmed receipt of the full purchase price. However, on 6 November 2001, Travelsight and the bank sued Atlas for a declaration that Atlas had breached the terms of the sale and purchase agreement and that Travelsight had rightfully terminated/rescinded the agreement. By an order dated 15 November 2002, the High Court granted the declaration sought and ordered a refund of all monies paid. Atlas refused to comply with the order. In the meantime, Travelsight continued with the repayment of its loan to the bank. Atlas was subsequently wound up but the liquidators refused to comply with the order of 15 November 2002. The liquidators viewed Travelsight as an unsecured creditor which ranked pari passu with other unsecured creditors leaving the liquidators free to deal with the property as an unencumbered asset. Travelsight sued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;236.;;">ss 236</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;279.;;">279 of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>: (a) to set aside the decision of the liquidators to sell the property and to prohibit them from selling and/or transferring the property, and (b) for an order to declare that the property was held by the liquidators upon trust for Travelsight. The court dismissed the action by Travelsight. Subsequently, Travelsight requested the bank to take possession of the property, to auction it, and to apply the proceeds towards the loan. The bank declined to do so. When Travelsight had fully settled its loan, the bank undertook that it would instruct its solicitors to allow Travelsight to appoint its own solicitors to prepare a "Deed of Receipt and Reassignment of all securities and secured properties" for execution by the bank. However, Travelsight was informed by the bank that the bank would not execute the deed of release and reassignment of the securities and secured properties on the ground that the right of Travelsight to the property was lost upon rescission of the agreement. Travelsight sued the bank for: (i) a declaration that Travelsight had fully settled the loan facility; (ii) a declaration that the bank had breached its undertaking to execute the deed of receipt and reassignment; (iii) a mandatory injunction to compel the bank to execute the deed of receipt and reassignment, in default of which, the refund by the bank of all sums paid towards the loan facility; (iv) a mandatory injunction to compel the bank to furnish a detailed statement of the overdraft account; and (v) general and special damages. The High Court granted the declarations and injunctions sought by Travelsight and, thus, the bank appealed to the Court of Appeal. Atlas and the liquidators also applied to the Court of Appeal to intervene in the appeal as appellants, contending breach of natural justice and that the order of the trial court had adversely affected their rights as the findings were made in their absence. The Court of Appeal allowed the application by Atlas and the liquidators. However, the appeals by the bank, Atlas and the liquidators were dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The bank, Atlas and the liquidators appealed to the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal by the bank but dismissing the appeals by Atlas and the liquidators with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The issue, as to whether there was anything to reassign, was as good as settled by the order dated 15 November 2002, which declared that the rescission of the purchase was valid and ordered a refund of the purchase price. In the instant case, where it was Travelsight's election to rescind the purchase and the court was only moved to validate the antecedent act of rescission by Travelsight, it was rescission at common law, where <i>restitutio ad integrum</i> was <i>de rigueur</i>. (paras 11 &amp;13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Atlas/liquidators had to make restitution of the purchase price before counter-restitution of the property. Without restitution of the purchase price, the property would remain with Travelsight as purchaser and the bank as assignee. It could not be contended that Travelsight was an unsecured creditor. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Mutual restitution did not follow in the instant case. When the full purchase price was paid in 1997, the property belonged to Travelsight as purchaser and the bank as assignee. The property ceased to be an asset of Atlas. But with rescission, the property would revert to Atlas, only by way of mutual restitution. Atlas had to refund the purchase price to take back the property. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> A constructive trust arises whenever the circumstances are such that it would be unconscionable of the owner of the legal title to assert his own beneficial interest and deny the beneficial interest of another. Atlas and the liquidators should have known that the property was not that of Atlas to deal with and dispose of as its own. The circumstances that would have been known to Atlas and the liquidators were such that it would have been unconscionable of Atlas and the liquidators to treat the property as its unencumbered asset and deny the beneficial interest of Travelsight and the bank. The circumstances were such that they gave rise to a constructive trust. (paras 30-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Upon failure of mutual restitution, a resulting trust arose, as reversion of the property to Atlas was wholly reliant on mutual restitution. Atlas and the liquidators still disposed of the property on 16 June 2011 and refused to refund the purchase price, in defiance of the order dated 15 November 2002 and in breach of the duty imposed by equity to account. Hence, Atlas should not be allowed to benefit from the rescission. The conduct was wholly unconscionable and therefore no order could be made in favour of Atlas and the liquidators. In the circumstances, Travelsight and the bank had a proprietary right to the refund. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> An assignment of the rights, title and benefit of a sale and purchase agreement is between a purchaser/borrower and a bank. The rescission of a sale and purchase agreement is between purchaser and vendor. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The assignment is the security of the bank and the security will be lost upon a valid rescission of the sale and purchase agreement. However, the assignment remains and the bank is nonetheless the assignee of the rights that will accrue to the borrower upon rescission of the sale and purchase agreement. While the order of rescission will affect the security of the bank, it will not affect the assignment nor the standing of the bank as assignee and or creditor of the borrower, or the equitable right of the bank to lay first claim to the money or property to be restituted, to discharge the outstanding loan. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Both Travelsight and the bank had agreed to relinquish the property and what would be restituted was a refund of money. It would be unreasonable to hold the bank to reassign the property. After rescission, Travelsight could not rely on the sale and purchase agreement to give it a clear title to the property, such that Travelsight could not rely on the assignment to give it the clear title. At most, the bank could only be held to assign the proprietary right to the refund and/or the rights for enforcing the same. (para 35)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The questions upon which leave was granted to RHB Bank Berhad to appeal in Civil Appeal 02-36-2013(W), and to Atlas Corporation Sdn Bhd (in liquidation) and liquidators, namely Taufiq Ahmad @ Ahmad Mustapha bin Ghazali and Mak Kam Choon to appeal in Civil Appeal 02-38-2013(W), against the order of the Court of Appeal in respect of the matter decided by the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts could be summarised as follows. On 15 March 1996, Travelsight (M) Sdn Bhd (hereinafter referred to as Travelsight) entered into an agreement to purchase property described as Suite No 1202, Tower B, Wisma Pantai, Kuala Lumpur (hereinafter referred to as the property) from Atlas Corporation Sdn Bhd (hereinafter referred to as Atlas) for RM816,696.00. Travelsight paid RM216,696.00 towards the purchase price. The balance was financed by the Development and Commercial Bank Berhad (now known as RHB Bank Berhad, hereinafter referred to as RHB) who granted a loan facility of RM600,000.00 (made up of a term loan of RM400,000.00 and an overdraft of RM200,000.00) to Travelsight to purchase the property, with the property as the security. At that point in time, given that a separate document of title to the property had yet to be issued, Travelsight could only assign its rights, interests and title in the property to the Development and Commercial Bank Berhad. By a deed of assignment dated 6 December 1996, Travelsight absolutely assigned its rights, interests and title in the property to the Development and Commercial Bank Berhad. Later, by letter dated 2 April 1997, Atlas confirmed that the full purchase price had been paid. On 6 November 2001, Travelsight and the Development and Commercial Bank Berhad filed action (Kuala Lumpur 24-4147-2001) (hereinafter referred to as the 2001 action) against Atlas for "a declaration that [Atlas] has breached the terms of the sale and purchase agreement dated 15 March 1996 and that [Travelsight] has rightfully terminated/rescinded the said sale and purchase agreement via a letter dated 13 February 2001 or whichever date the honourable court finds just and fair or in the alternative a declaration that the sale and purchase agreement is hereby rescinded due to the breach of contract by [Atlas]".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The 2001 action was tried by Abdul Malik Ishak J, as he then was, who held, on 15 November 2002, that the material representation by Atlas was false, in that the size of the property was smaller than had been represented, it being 1,470 square feet instead of 1,592 square feet (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2003_2_316;"><i>Travelsight (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Atlas Corporation Sdn Bhd</i> [2003] 2 MLRH 316</LINK>; [2003] 6 MLJ 658; [2003] 6 CLJ 344; [2003] 3 AMR 317). Abdul Malik Ishak J granted the sought declaration and ordered a refund of all monies paid and the application of the refund together with judgment interest towards redemption of the property. On 13 December 2002, Atlas filed an appeal against the order dated 15 November 2002. But the appeal was withdrawn. Hence, the order of Abdul Malik Ishak J dated 15 November 2002 became final. But still, Atlas would not comply with the order dated 15 November 2002. Meantime, Travelsight continued with repayment to the Development and Commercial Bank Berhad and later to RHB, until the loan facility of RM600,000.00 and interest thereon were repaid in full, and with payment of the assessment levied on the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In the interim, on 20 February 2004, Atlas was wound up on the petition of one Lee Chiu Hing Realty Sdn Bhd. The liquidators of Atlas refused to comply with the order dated 15 November 2002 and took the stand that Travelsight was an unsecured creditor who ranked <i>pari passu</i> with other unsecured creditors, while they, the liquidators, were free to deal with the property as an unencumbered asset. When steps were taken by the liquidators to invite tenders for the property, Travelsight filed action (Kuala Lumpur 28-946- 2008) (hereinafter referred to as the 2008 action), pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;236.;;">ss 236</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;279.;;">279 of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>, for orders to set aside the act and or decision of the liquidators to sell the property and to prohibit them from selling and or transferring the property, and for an order to declare that the property was held by the liquidators upon trust for Travelsight. But that 2008 action was dismissed by Kang Hwee Gee J, as he then was, who held, on 13 May 2009, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Travelsight filed but withdrew its appeal against the order of Kang Hwee Gee J. On 29 June 2009, Travelsight requested RHB to commence action to take possession of the property, to auction it, and to apply the proceeds towards the loan. RHB declined.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> By March 2011, Travelsight had fully settled its outstanding loan. By letter dated 8 March 2011, RHB undertook that it would instruct its solicitors to allow Travelsight to appoint its own solicitors to prepare a "Deed of Receipt and Reassignment of all securities and secured properties" for execution by RHB. But that was not carried through. By letters dated 8 March 2011 and 1 July 2011, RHB informed Travelsight that it would not execute the Deed of Release and Reassignment, on the ground that the right of Travelsight to the property was lost upon rescission of the purchase agreement dated 15 March 1996. In response, Travelsight filed the instant action against RHB for the following reliefs: (i) a declaration that Travelsight had fully settled the loan facility, (ii) a declaration that RHB had breached its undertaking to execute the Deed of Receipt and Reassignment, (iii) a mandatory injunction to compel RHB to execute the Deed of Receipt and Reassignment, in default of which, the refund by RHB of all sums paid towards the loan facility, (iv) a mandatory injunction to compel RHB to furnish a detailed statement of the overdraft account, and, (v) general and special damages. RHB defended the action on the ground that the right of Travelsight to the property was lost upon rescission of the purchase agreement dated 15 March 1996. At the trial court, learned counsel for RHB submitted that upon rescission of the purchase agreement "Atlas resumed its position as legal owner of the property", and that in the event that [RHB] is to discharge its rights over the property as assignee/chargee upon full settlement of monies due to RHB", RHB is legally bound to reassign the property to Atlas and or its liquidators. The trial court disagreed. The trial court held that pursuant to the order of Abdul Malik Ishak J dated 15 November 2001, the order of rescission of the purchase agreement was tied to the order of refund of the purchase price, and that RHB retained its rights to the property for so long as the said refund remained unpaid:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The trial court also emphatically disagreed with the submission "that the property should be reassign to Atlas/liquidators, even in the circumstance where Atlas/liquidators had not complied with the order dated 15 November 2002 to refund the purchase price, and it was Travelsight who had paid the redemption sum". The trial court tersely remarked, "To lend credibility to the defendant's arguments would be tantamount to a case of rewarding the guilty and punishing the innocent". Need it be said that the sought declarations and injunctions were granted, on 16 July 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Against those orders of the trial court, RHB appealed to the Court of Appeal. Then the unexpected occurred. On or about 25 September 2012, Atlas and liquidators applied to the Court of Appeal to intervene in the said appeal as appellants. In affidavits filed in support of their application, Atlas and liquidators contended that the "findings" of the trial court, namely the above underlined, were made in their absence and without them being heard, that there was a breach of natural justice and that the order of the trial court had adversely affected their rights and therefore ought to be set aside. On 12 November 2012, the Court of Appeal allowed Atlas and liquidators to intervene in the appeal as appellants and to reply to the affidavits filed at the trial court (see 618AR), thus putting Atlas and liquidators as participants in the proceeding, as if from inception.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Court of Appeal (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_320;"><i>RHB Bank Berhad v. Travelsight (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2013] 6 MLRA 320</LINK>; [2014] 1 MLJ 691) perceived the case of RHB and Atlas/liquidators as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, "the only issue for determination arising from the prayers in the originating summons is whether the appellant is obliged to reassign the [property] to the respondent pursuant to the contract between the parties. The answer to this question, in our opinion, depends on the terms of the contract between the appellant and the respondent and the equity of redemption inherent in every transaction involving the transfer of security pending repayment of a loan". Dismissing the appeals of RHB, Atlas and liquidators, the Court of Appeal then held that pursuant to cl 37 of the loan agreement, the right of RHB to retain the property survived only for as long as there were monies due from Travelsight, that RHB "was contractually bound to reassign the property forming the subject matter of the security upon full satisfaction of the loan amount", and that regardless of the construction of the loan agreement "there was an obligation in equity on the appellant to reassign the security in the form of the [property]".</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The Court of Appeal opined that the issue of whether there was anything to reassign following the rescission of the purchase ought to be tried in a fresh action between Travelsight and the liquidators of Atlas. But we believe that that issue - whether there was anything to reassign - was as good as settled by the order dated 15 November 2002, which declared that the rescission of the purchase was valid and ordered a refund of the purchase price. The trial court and the Court of Appeal construed that order to mean that Travelsight retained its rights to the property for as long as the refund remained unpaid. But we read that order to mean <i>restitutio in integrum</i> in accord with the law on rescission of a contract which is "... I think, clear on principles of general justice that as a condition to a rescission there must be a <i>restitutio in integrum</i>. The parties must be put in <i>status quo</i>" (<i>Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company</i> [1878] 3 App Cas 1218 at 1278, per Lord Blackburn, who laid down the principles which would become the statement of the law). "It is well established that it is a condition of relief that the party obtaining rescission should make <i>restitutio in integrum</i> or, in modern terminology, counter restitution to the other party. If counter restitution cannot be made the claim to rescission fails: see <i>Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company</i> [1878] 3 App Cas 1218" (<i>Dunbar Bank plc v. Nadeem and another</i> [1998] 3 All ER 876 per Millett, Morritt and Potter LJJ). "The requirement is that the party seeking to rescind a contract, and recover what he transferred under the contract, must be able to give back everything that he received under the contract. If in the circumstances of a particular case it is impossible for the party seeking restitution to make full counter restitution (for example, if he has sold the thing received to an innocent third party) then that impossibility can constitute a bar to rescission ... whereas the common law took a strict approach to the requirement that counter-restitution must be possible, equity adopted a more flexible attitude to this requirement" (<i>Duress, Undue Influence and Unconscionable Dealing</i>, 2nd edn by Nelson Enonchong, para 28-009). "Equity does not insist on exact counter restitution but is willing to make adjustments in money, so long as the results are practical and just" (<i>On Demand Information plc (in administrative receivership) and another v. Michael Gerson (Finance) plc and another</i> [2000] All ER (D) 1139, per Robert Walker LJ) (see <i>Securities and Investments Board v. Pantell SA and others (No 2)</i> [1993] 1 All ER 134), per Steyn LJ for the following example of a monetary adjustment: "The mere fact, for example, that the investor had sold on the shares would not by itself render the statutory remedy of rescission inapplicable. In such a case the counter restitution could be achieved by a financial adjustment based on the value of the shares. Rescission will only be impossible when financial adjustment is obstructed by circumstances going beyond the difficulty of valuation of investments which have been sold on: (see Peter Birks, <i>Introduction to the Law of Restitution</i> (1985) p 423") (on the fundamental difference between rescission <i>ab initio</i> and rescission <i>de futuro</i>, see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_1;"><i>Berjaya Times Square Sdn Bhd v. M-Concept Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 597; [2010] 1 CLJ 269, and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_121;"><i>LSSC Development Sdn Bhd v. Thomas Iruthayam &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 121</LINK>; [2007] 4 MLJ 1; [2007] 2 CLJ 434).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In his paper "<i>Rescission</i>", the contents of which were taken from the book "<i>Equity Practice and Precedents</i>" by Finnane, Newton and Wood, Edmund Finnane thus remarked on the remedy at common law and the remedy in equity:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Hence in the instant case, where it was Travelsight's election to rescind the purchase and the court was only moved to validate the antecedent act of rescission by Travelsight, it was rescission at common law, where <i>restitutio ad integrum</i> was <i>de rigueur</i>. "Where a transaction is rescinded there must be full restitution on both sides. The defendant must make restitution to the claimant and the claimant will make counter-restitution ... In short, rescission of a transaction requires mutual restitution by both parties. It is through restitution and counter-restitution that the effects of the transaction will be reversed and the parties put back to the position in which they were before they entered into it" (<i>Duress, Undue Influence and Unconscionable Dealing, supra,</i> para 28-015). There must be mutual restitution. "There ought ... to be a giving back and a taking back on both sides" (<i>Newbigging v. Adam</i> [1886] 34 Ch D 582, 595 per Bowen LJ). Money must be repaid and the property returned. Atlas/liquidators must make restitution of the purchase price before counter-restitution of the property. But in spite of the order dated 15 November 2002, Atlas/liquidators refused to refund the purchase price but yet claimed the property, which with respect was the exact scenario that Kang Hwee Gee J said would not happen. But Kang Hwee Gee J was absolutely right that the property would not vest with Atlas/liquidators without restitution of the purchase price. For without restitution of the purchase price, the property would remain with Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee. Given that the property remained with Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee, but which property was lost only because of sale by the liquidators, it could not be contended, as did Atlas/ liquidators, that Travelsight was an unsecured creditor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Rather, upon rescission of the purchase, it should be asked as to whether Travelsight had a proprietary right to the refund, as counter-restitution of the property was tied to the refund, and also as to whether Atlas/liquidators could assert ownership of the property without refund of the purchase price. "When a contract is rescinded it has the effect of revesting any property transferred in the transferor, so far as no formal steps are required for the retransfer. Thus property in goods will revest in the victim of fraud without more. If land has been conveyed, rescission will have the effect that the representor holds the title on constructive trust for the representee" (<i>Chitty on Contracts</i> 13th edn vol 1 para 6-114; see also <i>Greater Pacific Investments Pty Ltd (in Liq) v. Australian National Industries Ltd</i> [1996] 39 NSWLR 143 at 153). "A contract obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation is voidable, not void, even in equity. The representee may elect to avoid it, but until he does so the representor is not a constructive trustee of the property transferred ... " (<i>Lonrho Plc v. Fayed (No 2)</i> [1992] 1 WLR 1 at 11 per Millett J). "Upon a valid rescission of a contract at common law the legal title to the property which had passed to the wrongdoer automatically revests in the complainant. This is the case in relation to rescission on the ground of fraudulent misrepresentation [for rescission on the ground of innocent misrepresentation, see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_287;"><i>Admiral Cove Development Sdn Bhd v. Balakrishnan Devaraj &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 287</LINK>; [2011] 5 MLJ 309; [2011] 9 CLJ 133, and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_272;"><i>Sim Thong Realty Sdn Bhd v. Teh Kim Dar</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 272</LINK>; [2003] 3 MLJ 460; [2003] 3 CLJ 227; [2003] 4 AMR 460] ... A complainant to whom legal title to property has been revested by rescission is entitled to advance a proprietary claim over the property or its traceable substitute ... it is not in every case that legal title to property will automatically revest in the complainant by means of rescission at common law ... In cases where rescission at common law will not result in automatic revesting of legal title in the complainant, rescission may be sought in equity" (<i>Duress, Undue Influence and Unconscionable Dealing, supra</i>, para 28-012). "When a contract is rescinded in equity there is no automatic revesting of the legal title to property transferred under the contract. However, when granting rescission in equity, the court has powers to make appropriate orders for revesting of legal title ... the court recognises that, upon rescission of the contract, the beneficial title, which had passed to the transferee, revests in the transferor. The revesting is retrospective, since it seeks to put the complainant (transferor) in the position in which he would have been if the parties had not entered into the contract. This retrospective revesting gives the transferor a sufficient proprietary title to trace and recover the property. In the case of rescission on the ground of fraud, the revesting of equitable title takes effect from the date of the complainant's election to rescind the contract rather than the subsequent date when a court declares the complainant had the right to rescind" (<i>Duress, Undue Influence and Unconscionable Dealing, supra</i>, para 28- 013).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> "Legal title to land and chattels is generously protected." (Goff &amp; Jones, <i>The Law of Restitution</i> 6th edn <i>supra</i>, para 2-003). Upon rescission, beneficial title to property revests with the transferor. But upon rescission, would beneficial title to money also revests with the transferor? "According to the Restatement [of Restitution], American law ... makes no difference that the disputed subject-matter is money rather than land or other property" (<i>Proprietary Remedies in Insolvency: A Comparison of the Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment with English and Commonwealth Law by Anthony Duggan</i>, 68 Wash &amp; Lee L Rev 1229). But English case law is not as clear-cut. In <i>Chase Manhattan Bank NA v. Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd</i> [1981] Ch 105, where by mistake, the plaintiff paid to the defendants some $2 million, Goulding J held that "a person who pays money to another under a factual mistake retains an equitable property in it and the conscience of that other is subjected to a fiduciary duty to respect his proprietary right". But the reasoning of Goulding J was doubted by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v. Islington London BC</i> [1996] AC 669, where the bank had advanced funds to the local authority with the intention that the funds should become the absolute property of the local authority but the loan contract was <i>ultra vires</i>. In the same case, Lord Goff rejected the submission that the local authority was the bank's trustee:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Even so, Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that a constructive trust could arise if the payee bank's conscience was affected:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> At p 716, Lord Browne-Wilkinson suggested that "the court by way of remedy might impose a constructive trust on a defendant who knowingly retains property of which the plaintiff has been unjustly deprived" (Goff &amp; Jones, <i>The Law of Unjust Enrichment</i>, 8th edn, para 37-22 and <i>Wuhan Guoyu Logistics Group Co Ltd &amp; anor v. Emporiki Bank of Greece SA</i> [2013] EWCA Civ 1679 doubted the soundness of Lord Browne-Wilkinson's analysis - "the retention of the moneys after the recipient bank learned of the mistake may well have given rise to a constructive trust"; <i>Despina Papamichael v. National Westminster Bank and anor</i> [2003] EWHC 164 (Comm) agreed with Lord Browne-Wilkinson but saw no reason why proprietary remedy could not arise from mistake - see para 224). At pp 714-715, Lord Browne-Wilkinson thus described the difference between a "remedial" constructive trust and an "institutional" constructive trust:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> That description of the difference between a "remedial" constructive trust and an "institutional" constructive trust is widely cited. But the suggestion that English law should introduce the remedial constructive trust was rejected by the Court of Appeal in <i>Halifax Building Society v. Thomas</i> [1996] Ch 217 and in <i>Re Polly Peck (No 2)</i> [1998] 3 All ER 812.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In <i>Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd (In Receivership): Kensington v. Liggett</i> [1994] 3 NZLR 385, it was proposed that proprietary interest should be imposed retrospectively through restitutionary remedies to the moneys originally paid. The Privy Council per Lord Mustill disagreed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Still, the possibility of a proprietary remedy was left open by the Privy Council. Etherton J in <i>London Allied Holdings Ltd v. Lee and Others</i> [2007] EWHC 2061 observed: "There is considerable debate and uncertainty in English law as to whether the court will ever hold, and if so when, that a remedial constructive trust has arisen. The conventional view is that English law only recognises an institutional constructive trust. Any possibility of a remedial constructive trust was robustly rejected by Nourse LJ in <i>Re Polly Peck International plc (No 2)</i> [1998] 3 All ER 812 at pp 830-832; see also <i>Westdeutsche</i> at p 714F/G." On the other hand, Etherton J also noted that "in <i>Metall und Rohstoff AG v. Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc</i> [1990] 1 QB 391 at p 479H the Court of Appeal (Slade, Stocker and Bingham LJJ) said that they were satisfied that there is a good arguable case that circumstances may arise in which the court would be prepared to impose a remedial constructive trust; and Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Westdeutsche</i> at p 716G considered that the remedial constructive trust might be a suitable basis for developing proprietary restitutionary remedies, for example against a defendant who knowingly retains property of which the plaintiff has been unjustly deprived. The possibility of such a proprietary remedy was also left open by the Privy Counsel in <i>Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd</i> at p 104", Etherton J did not reach a concluded view on the remedial constructive trust.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> But we perceive that the notion of a remedial constructive trust is already part of English law. In <i>El Ajou v. Dollar Landholdings plc</i> [1993] 3 All ER 717, Millett J said that if a person "[has] been induced to purchase the shares by false and fraudulent misrepresentations, they are entitled to rescind the transaction and revest the equitable title to the purchase money in themselves, at least to the extent necessary to support an equitable tracing claim". The Court of Appeal in <i>Twinsectra Ltd v. Yardley and Others</i> [1999] All ER (D) 433 agreed: "There is also authority to be found in <i>El Ajou v. Dollar Land Holdings plc</i> ... that monies of the plaintiffs paid away by the plaintiffs in reliance on a fraudulent share selling scheme gave rise to an 'old fashioned institutional resulting trust' ". Rimer J in <i>Shalson and Others v. Russo and Others</i> [2003] EWHC 1637 expressly agreed with Millett J. Rimer J then reviewed a long list of authority supporting a proprietary right and then held "that upon the implied rescission of the loan contracts effected by the bringing of his Part 20 claim, Mr Mimran had revested in him the property in the money he advanced to Westland entitling him at least to trace it into assets into which it was subsequently applied". In <i>Otkritie International Investment Management Ltd and Others v. Urumov (also known as George Urumov) and Others</i> [2014] EWHC 191 (Comm), Eder J ruled that "The effect of such rescission is to revest equitable title to the money in OML and, in principle, to entitle OML to proprietary relief including declarations of ownership of specific assets and various consequential orders".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In another setting, in <i>Foskett v. McKeown</i> [2000] 3 All ER 97, where the premiums of a whole-life policy were partly paid from deposits held upon trust for the claimants, the House of Lords held that the policy money which were paid to the trustees of the policy, were held on trust for the claimants and others. "Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Millett (Lord Hoffman concurring) emphasised that the claim was an equitable proprietary one, the claimants had 'a continuing beneficial interest' not only in the money held on trust for them, but also in its traceable proceeds ... The claim in Foskett was to the substituted asset, namely the policy moneys; their Lordships had no doubt that this was a proprietary claim ... " (Goff &amp; Jones, <i>supra</i>, paras 2-2006 and 2-2007). "Both Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Millett were clear that the law of property protects pre-existing rights. So in Foskett the source of the claimants' property rights was their equitable title to the money used to pay the fourth and fifth premiums of the policy" (Goff &amp; Jones, <i>supra</i>, paras 2-2006 and 2-2008).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Goff &amp; Jones, <i>supra</i>, at para 2-010, observed that a court may create a proprietary right if the defendant's conduct is unconscionable, in the light of the decision in Lord Napier and Ettrick and Another v. Hunter and Others; <i>Lord Napier and Ettrick v. RF Kershaw Ltd and Others</i> [1993] AC 713, where it was held that "Where an insured person was paid out by an insurer for an insured loss in respect of which he also recovered damages from a wrongdoer the insured person was guilty of unconscionable conduct if he did not procure and direct that the sum due to the insurers by way of subrogation be paid out of those damages, and in order to protect the rights of the insurer under the doctrine of subrogation the damages recovered by the insured from the wrongdoer in respect of the insured loss were subject to an enforceable equitable proprietary lien or charge in favour of the insurer".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In <i>Halley v. The Law Society</i> [2003] EWCA Civ 97, para 105, the Court of Appeal per Mummery and Hale LJJ thus enunciated on equity, the conscience of the legal owner, and resulting trust:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Other notable decisions which upheld proprietary title in money paid were <i>Banque Belge pour l'Etranger v. Hambrouck</i> [1921] 1 KB 321, where Bankes and Atkin LJJ held that the plaintiff bank could follow its money at law and in equity, both the legal and equitable titles having revested in the bank when it commenced proceedings against <i>Hambrouck, and Lipkin Gorman v. Karpnale Ltd</i> [1991] 2 AC 548, "where the House of Lords took the momentous step of acknowledging the existence of an autonomous cause of action in unjust enrichment, which has been consistently affirmed in subsequent decisions" (<i>The Law of Trust and Equitable Obligations</i> 4th edn by Professor Robert Pearce and John Stevens, p 324).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> "... case law [therefore] suggests that on occasions, a court may create a proprietary right, and may do so for a number of diverse reasons ..." (Goff &amp; Jones, supra, para 2-010).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> A proprietary remedy may also be awarded where it is appropriate. In <i>Lonrho plc v. Fayed (No 2)</i> [1992] 1 WLR 1, 9, Millett J cited the following passage from <i>Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, Equity, Doctrines and Remedies</i>, 2nd edn p 327, which said that when appropriate the court would grant a proprietary remedy:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In <i>LAC Mineral v. International Corona Resources Ltd</i> [1989] 61 DLR (4th) 14, the Canadian Supreme Court per La Forest J observed that "there is no unanimous agreement on the circumstances in which a constructive trust will be imposed" and identified a number of factors that may be relevant in determining whether to award a proprietary remedy:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[29] In <i>Muschinski v. Dodds</i> [1985] 62 ALR 429, the High Court of Australia per Deane J thus enunciated on the remedial constructive trust in Australia:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Apparently, "the remedial constructive trust has been accepted in Australia, New Zealand and Canada" (<i>Modern Equity</i> by Hanbury &amp; Martin, <i>supra</i>, p 328), upheld in Singapore (see <i>Ching Mun Fong v. Liu Co Chit</i>, [2001] 3 SLR 10) and Hong Kong (<i>UBS AG v. Stand Ford International Enterprises Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [2002] 3 HKC 621) and accorded recognition by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_188;"><i>Tay Choo Foo v. Tengku Mohd Saad Tengku Mansur &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 188</LINK>; [2009] 1 MLJ 289; [2009] 2 CLJ 363. And as pointed out by Rimer J in Shalson v. Russo at 321-323, and in these grounds, <i>In re Eastgate</i> is hardly the only authority for the proposition that "where a purchaser is misled into buying goods he is automatically entitled upon rescinding the contract to a proprietary right superior to those of all the vendor's other creditors, exercisable against the whole of the vendor's assets". It is clear that a proprietary restitutionary right to money could be asserted. But is this an appropriate case to grant a proprietary remedy? To capitulate, by letter dated 2 April 1997, Atlas confirmed that the full purchase price had been paid. Since already paid, then the property belonged to Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee, whose respective interest as purchaser and assignee would be registered after the issuance of a document of title. And since already paid, the property ceased to be the legal and or beneficial property of Atlas. But was that affected by rescission? First, it should be underscored that rescission on the ground of fraud was validated by an order of court (dated 5 November 2002). Rescission was an accomplished fact, at least in law. By right, <i>restitutio in integrum</i> should follow. There should be full restitution by both sides. But mutual restitution did not follow. Atlas seized on the part of the order that validated rescission, but refused to honour the part of the order that ordered refund, with the result that Atlas retained both property and purchase price, while only entitled to one. In defence of their action, Atlas and liquidators contended that Travelsight was an unsecured creditor who ranked <i>pari passu</i> with other unsecured creditors, while they, the liquidators, were free to deal with the property as an unencumbered asset. But was it valid to contend that Atlas and liquidators were free to deal with the property as an unencumbered property, without a corresponding refund of the purchase price as ordered? As said, when the full purchase price was paid in 1997, the property belonged to Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee. As of 1997, the property ceased to be an asset of Atlas. But with rescission, the property would revert to Atlas, that is, by way of mutual restitution. That is the same as to say that without mutual restitution, the property would not revert to Atlas. Atlas had to refund the purchase price to take back the property. We are mindful that "a constructive trust [in the remedial sense] arises whenever the circumstances are such that it would be unconscionable of the owner of the legal title to assert his own beneficial interest and deny the beneficial interest of another. It arises from circumstances which are, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, known to the legal owner, for if they were not his conscience would not be affected" ("<i>Restitution and Constructive Trusts</i>" 1988 Law Quarterly Review vol 114 p 399, per Millett LJ at 400). "A constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression. When property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee" (<i>Beatty v. Guggenheim Exploration Co</i>, [NY 1919] 122 NE 378, 388 per Cardozo J).</p>

      <b>[31]</b> It could be reasonably assumed that the circumstances that would have been known to Atlas and liquidators were: (i) the full purchase price had been paid, (ii) the property belonged to Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee, (iii) the order dated 15 November 2002 validated rescission and ordered a refund of the purchase price, and, (iv) the purchase price had not been refunded. Given those latter circumstances that would have been known to them, it could be further assumed that Atlas and liquidators should have known that the property was not that of Atlas to deal and dispose as its own. Fairly said, the circumstances that would have been known to Atlas and liquidators were such that it would be unconscionable of Atlas and liquidators to treat the property as its unencumbered asset and deny the beneficial interest of Travelsight and RHB. The circumstances were such that gave rise to a constructive trust, in the remedial sense, which equity imposed on Atlas and liquidators, to deal not with the property as its beneficial property (on the duty imposed by equity to account to the true owner of money or property, see also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_151;"><i>Koh Siew Keng &amp; Anor v. Koh Heng Jin</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 151</LINK>; [2008] 3 MLJ 822; [2008] 3 CLJ 450). The effect of the order dated 15 November 2002 was such that the property would only vest with Atlas upon mutual restitution. Otherwise, the liquidators could not deal with the property as the beneficial property of Atlas. And the effect of the order 15 November 2002 was that until mutual restitution, the assets in the hands of the liquidators properly representing the appellant's refund at the date of commencement of winding up did not belong to Atlas (see <i>Chase Manhattan v. Israel-British Bank</i> at 120). Indeed, upon failure of mutual restitution, there arose a resulting trust, as reversion of the property to Atlas was wholly reliant on mutual restitution. Yet, with knowledge of the circumstances that would have been known to them that gave rise to a constructive trust with respect to the refund, and a resulting trust in the event of failure of mutual restitution, Atlas and liquidators still disposed of the property on 16 June 2011, and refused to refund the purchase price, in defiance of the order dated 15 November 2002 and in breach of the duty imposed by equity to account. That conduct, certainly beyond the pale, was wholly unconscionable, which itself is ground enough to grant the proprietary remedy. Now given further that there was an order of court to refund, a constructive trust and a resulting trust as aforesaid, and that the refund was in exchange of property that belonged to Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee, the grounds are in surfeit to hold that Travelsight and RHB had a proprietary right, rather than and as opposed to a personal claim, to the refund.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> "Equity had a general jurisdiction in setting aside contracts to ensure the observance of the requirements of good conscience and practical justice ... In seeking to do what was practically just between the parties, in a case involving fraud, the court exercised its jurisdiction to the full in order if possible to prevent a party enjoying the benefit of his fraud ... " (<i>Vadasz v. Pioneer Concrete (SA) Pty Ltd</i> [1995] 130 ALR 570, High Court of Australia, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ). Atlas should not be allowed to benefit from rescission without restitution on its part. No order could be made in favour of Atlas and liquidators. Rather, the order should be that Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee had a proprietary right to the refund.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> However, in view of the order dated 15 November 2002 which had supplanted the provisions of the loan agreement that pertained to the property and its redemption, there should not have been that order by the courts below to RHB to reassign the property to Travelsight. Both Travelsight and RHB had agreed to rescission. When they applied for the order dated 15 November 2002, they explicitly agreed to relinquish their respective title and interest in the property in exchange for a refund of the purchase price. Upon the grant of the order dated 15 November 2002, the property was effectively relinquished by both Travelsight and RHB. Hence, as against RHB, when both had agreed to a refund in lieu of property, Travelsight could not later ask for a reassignment of the property that it, together with RHB, had willingly relinquished.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It comes to this. Travelsight had a proprietary right to the refund. But the refund was not paid. By right, the property remained with Travelsight as purchaser and RHB as assignee. But that the property had been sold. To pronounce that the property remained with Travelsight and RHB would only be idle. In <i>Spence v. Crawford</i> [1939] 3 All ER 271, 290 Lord Wright stated that the equitable remedy of rescission, when applied, must be moulded in accordance with the exigencies of the particular case. To do practical justice (see <i>Solle v. Butcher</i> [1950] 1 KB 671, 696 per Lord Denning), there should be a consequential order, to the liquidators to forthwith pay the refund to Travelsight, as RHB had been repaid.</p>

      <b>[35]</b> We now answer the leave questions in English, which also answer the leave questions in Bahasa Malaysia, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> For the above reasons, we unanimously dismiss the appeal of Atlas and liquidators with costs. Travelsight had a proprietary right to the refund which ought to have been restituted in 2002 and so could not be further withheld. Consequently, we order Atlas and liquidators to forthwith refund the purchase price together with all interests thereon, computed as per order dated 15 November 2002, to Travelsight.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Finally, we unanimously allow the appeal of RHB and set aside all orders of the courts below, save and except for the declaration that Travelsight had paid the full purchase price.</p>
