        <SUBJECT_INDEX>The appellant</SUBJECT_INDEX> - the executrix of the deceased - claimed that the 4th defendant had fraudulently transferred to the 1st and 2nd respondents certain land ("the land") owned by the deceased after the deceased's death. The 4th defendant, an Indian national, had done so whilst acting under a Power of Attorney purportedly given to him by the deceased. The appellant complained that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433F.;;">s 433F of the National Land Code ("Code")</LINK> did not permit a foreign national holding a Power of Attorney to transfer landed property in Malaysia. The appellant's action for declaratory and other relief to <i>inter alia</i>, set aside the transfer was dismissed by the High Court. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal. The issue was whether the transfer of the land was void for breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433F.;;">s 433F of the Code</LINK>.</p>

    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <i>Locus standi</i> of the appellant or the deceased as the lawful owner of the land in dispute was not one of the issues to be tried. It was thus wrong for the trial Judge to dwell on such issue in length in the grounds of judgment when it was not related to illegality or public policy. (<i>China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation &amp; Anor v. DCX Technologies Sdn Bhd (refd)</i>). (para 10)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The words used by the Legislature in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433F.;;">s 433F of the Code</LINK> were clear and did not suffer from any ambiguity. The respondents did not advance any argument on the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433F.;;">s 433F</LINK>. As a general rule, a court will adopt the construction of a statute which will give some effect to all the words which it contains. (<i>Krishnadas Achutan Nair &amp; Ors v. Maniyam Samykano (refd)</i>). (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the 4th defendant was an Indian national and would not be able to execute any instrument for the transfer of property in dispute. The transfer and registration was void and bad in law and it ought to be expunged from the records of the land registry. (para 13(a))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The burden of proof was upon the 1st and 2nd respondents to show that the Power of Attorney was a valid and enforceable Power of Attorney. However, the 1st and 2nd respondents had not discharged their evidential burden, taking into consideration that default judgment had been entered against the 4th defendant and the 4th defendant failed to give evidence in this case.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/plaintiff (executrix) appeals against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who refused to grant declaratory orders as well as incidental relief to set aside the transfer to the 1st and 2nd respondents executed by the 4th defendant as purported power of attorney for appellant (deceased) and transfer it back to the appellant's name. The appeal was heard on 13 March 2015 and we reserved judgment. My learned brothers Vernon Ong JCA and Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA have read the judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The deceased RM Muthiah Chettiar was the owner of the land in dispute. The appellant, executrix of the deceased is claiming that the land has been <i>inter alia</i> fraudulently transferred to the 1st and 2nd respondents by the deceased purported Power of Attorney, the 4th defendant against whom the appellant has obtained a default judgment and is not a respondent in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It is not in dispute that the 4th defendant is an Indian citizen and he was holding a Power of Attorney purportedly given by the deceased, and the property was transferred after the deceased death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The central complaint of the appellant is that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433F.;;">s 433F of the National Land Code (NLC 1965)</LINK> does not permit a foreign national holding a Power of Attorney to transfer landed property in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> What is essential to note in this case is that the parties had filed agreed facts which is found at pp 141A to 143D of the Appeal Record. The learned trial judge had written a 20 page judgment without focusing on the relevant issues and discussing irrelevant matters not falling within the compass of the agreed issues by the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The real issue for the determination of the appeal in the instant case is related to whether the transfer is void for breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433F.;;">s 433F</LINK>. The procedural and/or evidential issue which relates to the Power of Attorney is that - who has the burden of proving there was a valid and enforceable Power of Attorney given by the deceased to transfer the deceased's property, that too upon the deceased's death? In the instant case, the Power of Attorney was marked as ID13 and was never marked as exhibit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant has filed a lengthy statement of claim and the English version runs to about 25 pages. The prayers read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

      <b>[8]</b> Chronology of Events and Issues to be Tried.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Issues to be tried agreed between the 1st and 2nd respondents read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It must be noted, <i>locus standi</i> of the appellant or the deceased as the lawful owner of the property in dispute is not one of the issues to be tried. It was plainly wrong for the learned trial judge to dwell on this issue in length in the grounds of judgment when it is not related to illegality or public policy. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_5_289;"><i>China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation &amp; Anor v.

      <b>[11]</b> Section <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;433F.;;">433F(1) of NLC 1965 </LINK>says any deed or instrument executed by a non-citizen under a power of attorney in respect of any alienated land or any interest therein in favour of any person shall be void.

    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have read the Appeal Record and able submissions of the learned counsel. After giving much consideration to the submission of the respondents, we take the view that the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> For reasons stated above, we will allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court and will deal with the prayers in the statement of claim to make appropriate orders and directions to provide the relief.</p>
