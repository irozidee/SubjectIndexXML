    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant's appeal stemmed from the decision of the High Court allowing the respondent's claim against the appellant for passing off the respondent's tiger stripes design ('the design') and trade mark. The appellant was a company in the business of supplying sporting apparels, equipment, accessories and sports goods. It was the respondent's contractual supplier since 1990. The respondent was a statutory body established under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_29;;">National Sports Council Act 1971</LINK>, its main responsibility being the promotion of sports in the country. The respondent requested the appellant in 2006 to produce and supply sports clothing bearing the design. Some three years later, the appellant filed for the registration of the design under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;;">Trade Marks Act 1976 ('the Act')</LINK> claiming itself to be the first user of the design as a trade mark in the course of trade. The Registrar of Trade Marks duly registered the design as a trade mark in the name of the appellant. Hence, the respondent's claim for passing off, being a person aggrieved. The appellant's position was that whilst it recognised that the respondent was the originator of the design, the legal right for the registration of the trade mark was not based on the creation of the mark but on the first user of the design as a trade mark. The appellant contended that the respondent did not use the design as a trade mark whilst the respondent claimed to be the owner as well as the first user of the design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Apart from being the owner of the design, the respondent was in fact and in law the first user of the design since its creation in 2005. The appellant was only appointed as a paid contract supplier in 2006 to produce garments carrying the design for the Malaysian Contingent participating in the Asian Games in Doha. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The phrase "in the course of trade" did not mean that it must be in the course of business to make some profit. The respondent was a statutory body charged with the responsibility of the promotion of sports in the country. Although the respondent did not make money when supplying its athletes with free sports clothes and sports goods bearing the design, the respondent however was in the business of promoting its statutory activity of enhancing the standard of sports in the country. The appointment of the appellant was an act in the course of trade by the respondent and in the process goodwill was generated. The respondent, as early as 2005 acquired goodwill and had the intention to use the design as a mark in the course of trade, even if there was no evidence of any immediate use. As matters stood, the respondent could not use the design without the consent of the appellant and without infringing the trade mark registered by the appellant. (paras 24-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Before the appellant's appointment, the sports goods bearing the design was produced and supplied by another supplier, one Antioni. Antioni was appointed upon the launch of the national jersey carrying the design in 2005. Going by the appellant's argument that the use of a specified mark or design under a supply contract was equal to first use of the mark or design for the benefit of the supplier, then Antioni would contractually be the first user of the design and not the appellant. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The use of the design in "a trade mark sense" was not necessarily achieved only through the manufacturing and sale of goods with the design and goodwill achieved through business activities. The respondent did not restrict itself to the "traditional" passing off claim where the words "in the course of trade" were restricted to activities such as manufacturing, supplying and selling only. The restricted interpretation would mean disregarding other forms of use in the course of trade such as obtaining sponsorships, granting merchandising rights and other licensing rights over the use of the design. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Where there were two competing claims as in the present case by the respondent as the owner of the design and the appellant as the supplier of the sports goods with the incorporated design, it could be argued that the appellant's use of the design could be taken or deemed to be the respondent's use of the mark as the owner of the design. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The respondent need not be a commercial entity to manufacture and sell sports goods bearing the design before it could be said that it was using the design in the course of trade. The respondent by using the design owned the goodwill generated thereby in relation to the mark. The respondent in using the design for purposes of branding could be deemed to be using the mark in the course of trade. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The appellant by registering itself as the proprietor of the design as a trade mark effectively prevented the respondent from appointing any other sports goods manufacturer to produce and supply goods bearing the design. The appellant surreptitiously used the circumstances to its benefit at the expense of the respondent. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The respondent was the common law owner of the design, contending all along that it was the rightful proprietor of the design since its launch in 2005. The respondent as the rightful owner used the design as a trade mark and had a genuine and present intention to use the design as a trade mark in the trade mark sense and in the course of trade, at any time before the appellant's application for registration on 9 July 2009. The respondent was clearly an aggrieved person within the ambit and scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46(1) of the Act</LINK> and thus had the locus standi to bring this action. In the circumstances, the respondent succeeded in proving on a balance of probabilities that it had used the design as a trade mark in the course of trade. (paras 35-43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The respondent had legitimate expectations when dealing with the sports goods that its activities would be affected if the appellant were to be allowed to continue using the design as a trade mark. Further, there was no material difference between the respondent's mark and the appellant's mark. They were identical as the appellant copied the respondent's mark without any embellishment whatsoever. There was no evidence to show that the design was distinctive of the appellant's goods in the commercial, trade and business sense. (paras 45-46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> The appellant demonstrated bad faith when applying for registration of the design when it declared in its statutory declaration in support of the application that the mark belonged to it. That statement was not true as the appellant acknowledged in evidence that the design belonged to the respondent. Thus the declaration was false or misleading. It was a wrongful claim that led to the registration of the design as a mark belonging to the appellant without just and sufficient cause. (para 46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> As for passing off, the respondent enjoyed goodwill and reputation in the sports goods bearing the design even before the appellant applied for registration. The respondent sought relief to restrain the appellant from using the design in connection with its goods so as to prevent the public from being confused into thinking that the appellant's goods were associated with those of the respondent. The tort of passing off was a common law wrong. Passing off did not protect the use of a mark, name, get up or any other sign which was distinctive of a business, but the goodwill of the business that used them. Whether or not there was goodwill attached to a product in a particular case was a question of fact to be determined by the court. The degree of goodwill depended on the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence adduced at trial. (paras 47-50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> The use of the design on sports goods was acknowledged as a national identity in sports in Malaysia. The design was recognised by the public as distinctive of the respondent's sports goods. The appellant's mark by being similar to that of the respondent would cause confusion in the minds of members of the public into believing that the appellant's mark was somehow associated with the respondent. The appellant was liable for breaches under the tort of passing off for using the design rightfully belonging to the respondent. However, damages would not be dealt with since the respondent was not claiming for them. (paras 51-56)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mah Weng Kwai JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant is a private limited company and is in the business of supplying sporting apparels, equipment, accessories and sporting goods generally (Sports Goods). It had been a contract supplier of the same to the respondent since 1990.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent is a statutory body established under the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_29;;">National Sports Council Act 1971</LINK>. Its main responsibility is the promotion of sports in the country.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In 2006, the appellant was requested by the respondent to produce and supply sports clothing bearing the Tiger Stripes Design (the design), the subject matter of this suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Some three years later, on 9 July 2009 the appellant claiming itself to be the first user of the design as a trade mark in the course of trade filed for registration of the design under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;;">Trade Marks Act 1976 (the Act)</LINK> while it was still a supplier of Sports Goods to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 11 February 2011 and 19 February 2011, the design was registered as a trade mark by the Registrar of Trade Marks Malaysia in the name of the appellant as the proprietor in the Register for a period of ten years from 9 July 2009 to 9 July 2019 in Class 18 under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;;">Trade Marks Act 1976</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1997_460;;">Trade Marks Regulations 1997</LINK> in respect of "sporting apparels, equipment and accessories and sports clothing" vide Trade Mark No 09011365 and Trade Mark No 09011366, respectively. The design is depicted below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Being a person aggrieved, the respondent filed a suit against the appellant claiming that it is the lawful owner of the design and trade mark and that the appellant had, <i>inter alia</i>, passed-off the respondent's design. The respondent also sought relief to revoke the registration of the appellant and to rectify the Trade Marks Register. The appellant in turn counterclaimed for infringement and passing-off of its Trade Mark against the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant did not dispute that the respondent is the lawful owner of the design but the appellant claimed to be the lawful holder of the trade mark on the ground that it was the first user of the design as a trade mark in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> To fully appreciate the claim of the respondent it is necessary to trace the development of the design from its creation/inception till its registration as a trade mark in 2011 by the appellant. This is to demonstrate the history of the design and the efforts taken by the respondent in its development.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant's position was that whilst it recognised the fact that the respondent was the originator of the design, the legal right for the registration of the trade mark was not based on the creation of the mark but on the first user of the design as a trade mark.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant contended that the respondent did not use the design as a trade mark although they had ownership of it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant further contended that infringement was not an issue as the respondent could use the design as 'an indicator or badge of support' when it needed to, as user of a "badge of support" was not in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant also contended that the origin and function of the design and the nexus between the production and sale of items must be in the context of use to the extent that it conveys to the public that the products are those of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Counsel for the appellant submitted that although the respondent's claim was for passing-off, no evidence in support had been adduced to prove misrepresentation nor the use of the design as a distinctive trade mark.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondent's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The position taken by the respondent was quite straightforward. It claimed to be the owner as well as the first user of the design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The respondent claimed that it had been using the design as a trade mark in the course of trade although not for profit as it was a statutory body and not a profit-oriented organisation. The design or logo attracted people to its events and was a means to obtain sponsorships.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> After a full trial, the learned trial judge allowed the respondent's claim with costs. In allowing the claim the learned trial judge held that "in my view the defendant has invaded the plaintiff 's intangible property right in his product by misappropriating the Tiger Stripes description/mark which has become recognised by the public as distinctive of the plaintiff. On the evidence, the public would only associate the Tigers Stripes mark with the plaintiff ".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Being dissatisfied with the decision, the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Upon reading the Appeal Record and the written submissions of counsel for the appellant and the respondent and upon hearing the oral submissions of counsel aforesaid, the court was of the unanimous view that there was no appealable error in the decision of the learned trial judge and accordingly dismissed the appeal with costs of RM30,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Being dissatisfied with the decision of this court, the appellant has now filed its Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> At the outset the respondent had founded its claim on three causes of action namely, infringements of copyright, industrial design and trade mark. However in the appeal, the respondent did not pursue its claim for infringements under copyright and industrial design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Thus, the sole question to be determined by the court was whether the appellant had the legal right to file for registration of the design as its trade mark.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The court took cognisance of the following undisputed facts <i>inter alia</i>, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We are of the considered view that apart from being the owner of the design, the respondent was in fact and in law the first user of the design since its creation in 2005. The respondent was only appointed as a paid contract supplier in 2006 to produce garments carrying the design for the Malaysian Contingent participating in the Asian Games in Doha.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> That said, the real issue to be determined is whether the respondent had used the design "in the course of trade". It was rigorously submitted by counsel for the appellant that the respondent did not use the design in the course of trade as it was not in its nature to do so. With respect, we disagree with this narrow interpretation of the phrase "in the course of trade" to mean that it must be in the course of business to make some profit. It must be remembered that the respondent is a statutory body charged with the responsibility of promotion of sports in the country. One of the ways to do so is to have a "corporate identity" created so that all the athletes representing Malaysia would be happy to wear sports clothing and use sports goods bearing the design with a high degree of pride, responsibility and nationalism. The design would create or cultivate the spirit of togetherness amongst the athletes in any Malaysian team or contingent. The design would also allow athletes to have a visual sense of belonging among them. Thus, while it is obvious that the respondent would not be making money out of its own athletes when supplying them with free sports clothes and sports goods bearing the design, it was nonetheless in the business of promoting its statutory activity of enhancing the standard of sports in the country.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The court in coming to its decision was prepared to apply a more liberal interpretation of the phrase 'in the course of trade'. The design had been used or intentionally used by the respondent in its activities since 2005. The appellant came into the picture only because of its appointment to produce and supply Sports Goods to the respondent in 2006. It can be said that the appointment of the appellant was an act in the course of trade by the respondent and in the process goodwill had been generated. The respondent, as early as in 2005 had acquired goodwill and had this intention to use the design as a mark in the course of trade, even if there was no evidence of any immediate use.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We are of the view that the appellant did not rank as the first user in point of time (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;25.;;">s 25, Trade Marks Act 1976</LINK>). As mentioned earlier, it was the respondent who had brought the appellant into the business of supplying Sports Goods to the respondent. But, some three years later, the appellant had the audacity to file for registration of the design as the proprietor on the basis that it was the first user of the design. Factually, the appellant knows that the position taken cannot be correct and cannot be seen to be seeking relief from the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The conduct of the appellant cannot help but remind us of the proverbial camel and the Arab in the tent. The respondent brought the appellant in and after three years of doing business with the respondent, the appellant now wants the respondent out. Surely, this conduct of the appellant, like that of the camel, cannot be condoned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The irony of the situation is amplified when it is noted that the respondent cannot use the design, as matters stand, without the consent of the appellant. While the respondent can obtain sponsorships from third parties, for example, Telekom Malaysia as submitted by the appellant, the respondent has no locus to authorise Telekom Malaysia to carry on any of the activities using the design for business without infringing the trade mark of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The court agrees with the respondent that while the appellant has conveniently labelled its 'first use' of the design as a mark since the Asian Games in Doha in 2006, no distinction is however made by the appellant from its use arising from that first order of garments by the respondent in 2006 and the appellant's own use of the very same design as a trade mark from then till now.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It was in evidence that upon the launch of the national jersey carrying the design in 2005, a manufacturer/producer, namely Antioni, had been appointed to produce and supply the national jersey carrying the design. Thus going by the appellant's argument that the use of a specified mark or design under a supply contract equals to first use of the mark or design for the benefit of the supplier, then as a matter of fact the appellant has failed to show it was the 'first user' when in fact the first user contractually was Antioni.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> With respect, the court cannot accept the argument of counsel for the appellant that the respondent has no <i>locus standi</i> to bring this action as the respondent has not proved it had used the design in the 'trade mark sense'. The appellant contended that the use in 'a trade mark sense' can only be achieved through the manufacturing and sale of goods with the design embodied and goodwill can only be achieved through business activities such as 'manufacturing, supplying and selling' the sports attire and garments it had produced. This line of argument overlooks two points namely (1) the respondent did not restrict itself to this so called 'traditional' passing-off claim where the words 'in the course of trade' are narrowly restricted to activities such as manufacturing, supplying and selling only and (2) the restricted interpretation would mean disregarding other forms of use in the course of trade such as obtaining sponsorships, granting merchandising rights and other licensing rights over the use of the design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> At all material times the appellant was fully aware that it was not legally entitled to the mark and had unlawfully applied to register the design. Where there are two competing claims as in this case by the respondent as the owner of the design and the appellant as the supplier of the Sports Goods with the design incorporated on the items, it can be argued that the use of the design by the appellant can be taken or deemed to be use of the mark by the respondent as the owner of the design. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_5_793;"><i>Jost Cranes GmbH &amp; Co KG v. Jost Cranes Sdn Bhd</i> [2010] 5 MLRH 793</LINK>; [2010] 4 MLJ 191).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> A further word on the 'use in the course of trade' argument. We are of the view that the respondent need not be a 'commercial entity' before it can be said that the respondent had used the design 'in the course of trade'. The respondent need not be a commercial entity to manufacture and sell sporting goods bearing the design before it can be said that it was using the design in the course of trade. The respondent by using the design owns the goodwill generated thereby in relation to the mark. The respondent in using the design for purposes of branding can be deemed to be using the mark in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The appellant by registering itself as the proprietor of the design as a trade mark has effectively prevented the respondent from appointing any other sports goods manufacturer to produce and supply goods bearing the design to it. As aptly stated by counsel for the respondent in his written submission that "the act of the appellant claiming ownership of the tiger stripes design as its very own trade mark would effectively hold the appellant and through it the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the Government of Malaysia, to ransom, against ever giving permission or licence to any other party to produce the same goods and using the same Tiger Stripes design, without the appellant's permission". To state the obvious, this has created an undesirable situation where the appellant has surreptitiously used the circumstances to its own benefit at the expense of the respondent. The result is an affront to good common sense and public policy and the registration ought to be struck out from the Register.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Aggrieved Person</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Before the respondent could succeed in its claim, it had to demonstrate that it was a person aggrieved and having <i>locus standi</i> under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46 of the Trade Marks Act 1976</LINK> to file the action. It will be noted that the respondent had contended all along that it is the rightful proprietor of the design since its launch in 2005. We are of the view that the respondent is the common law owner of the design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The issue to be determined by the court was whether the respondent as the rightful owner had used the design as a trade mark or whether the respondent has a genuine and present intention to use the design as a trade mark in the trade mark sense and in the course of trade, at any time before the appellant's application for registration on 9 July 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It will be useful to bear in mind the definition of 'trade mark' as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;39.;;">s 39 of the Trade Marks Act 1976</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It will be appropriate to also consider the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46 of the Trade Marks Act 1976</LINK> at this juncture. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">Section 45(1)(a)</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46 of the Act</LINK> provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The words 'aggrieved person' have been considered by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_742;"><i>McLaren International Ltd v. Lim Yat Meen</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 742</LINK>; [2009] 5 MLJ 741; [2009] 4 CLJ 749 to mean as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The consideration of the words 'aggrieved person' by the Federal Court in <i>McLaren (supra)</i> was followed by Azahar Mohamed J (now JCA) in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_3_879;"><i>Agricultural And Processed Food Products Export Development Authority; Of India (Apeda) &amp; Ors v. Syarikat Faiza Sdn Bhd</i> [2010] 3 MLRH 879</LINK>; [2011] 2 MLJ 768; [2011] 9 CLJ 394 where His Lordship had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_211;"><i>LB (Lian Bee) Confectionery Sdn Bhd v. QAF Limited</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 211</LINK>; [2012] 4 MLJ 20; [2012] 3 CLJ 661; [2012] 2 AMR 201 at para 16, it was held by the court that "Not anybody can be an "aggrieved person" for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46 TMA</LINK>. He must be someone who has some element of legal interest, right or legitimate expectation in its own mark which is being substantially affected by the presence of the registered trade mark. The interest and right must be legal or lawful. It does not apply to an infringer of the said registered trade mark."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In the present case, this court is amply satisfied from the facts that the respondent is clearly an aggrieved person to come within the ambit and scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46(1) of the Act</LINK> and thus has the <i>locus standi</i> to bring this action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Use Of The Design As A Trade Mark In The Course Of Trade By The Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Thus, the next important question to be determined by the court was whether the respondent had used the design as a trade mark in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The unanimous view of the court is that the respondent has succeeded in proving on a balance of probabilities, that it has used the design as a trade mark in the course of trade. In summary and at the risk of repetition, the following are the facts accepted by the court as having been established by the respondent:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We are of the considered view that the learned trial judge was correct in her approach when determining the meaning of the phrase 'in the course of trade' when she held that "In my view, what amounts to 'in the course of trade' for the purposes of the issue in this case is not what can be argued to be its meaning in the strict sense or scope, but what the ordinary perception of the concept in the course of trade is in the eyes of the public" and in relying on the case of <i>Law Society of England &amp; Wales v. Society of Lawyers &amp; Ors</i> [1996] 23 FSR 739.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> It can be said that the purpose of a mark is to indicate that the goods are the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark by virtue of manufacture, selection, certifications, and dealing with or offering for sale. In the present case, the least that the respondent did with the Sports Goods bearing the design was to distribute them for free to Malaysian delegates thereby dealing with the goods. The respondent had legitimate expectations when dealing with the Sports Goods in that its activities would be affected if the appellant was to be allowed to continue using the design as a trade mark.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The registration of the design as a trade mark by the appellant was without sufficient cause for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Passing-Off</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The court has already held that the respondent had enjoyed goodwill and reputation in the Sports Goods bearing the design even before the appellant had applied for registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The respondent sought relief to restrain the appellant from using the design in connection with its goods so as to prevent the public from being confused in thinking that the appellant's goods are associated with those of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The tort of passing-off is a common law wrong (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_313;"><i>McCurry Restaurant (KL) Sdn Bhd v. McDonald's Corporation</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 313</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 774; [2009] 3 CLJ 540). Passing-off does not protect the use of a mark, name, get up or any other sign which is distinctive of a business, but the goodwill of the business that uses them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Whether or not there is goodwill attached to a product in a particular case is a question of fact to be determined by the court. The degree or amount of goodwill will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence adduced at trial. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_2_481;"><i>U-Re Auto Sdn Bhd v. York Pacific Holdings Ltd</i> [2002] 2 MLRA 481</LINK>; [2004] 3 CLJ 172).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> For reasons discussed earlier, the court was satisfied that the respondent was the first user of the design from as early as 14 April 2005. The use of the design on sporting goods has been acknowledged as a national identity in sports in Malaysia. It was the respondent that had appointed the appellant to produce the Sports Goods carrying the design in 2006 with the first invoice issued on 11 December 2006 by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> What is objectionable in the tort of passing-off is the risk of confusion of the marks among the end consumers. Confusion is a question of fact to be determined by the court. (see <i>Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Ltd v. The Pub Squash Co Ltd</i> [1981] RPC 429).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In <i>Leather Cloth Co Ltd v. American Leather Cloth Co Ltd</i> [1865] 11 HL Cas 523 it was held by the court that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> On a comparison of the appellant's mark and the respondent's mark, as held earlier, there is in fact no difference between the marks. The design has been recognised by the public as distinctive of the respondent's Sports Goods. The appellant's mark by being similar to that of the respondent would cause confusion in the minds of members of the public into believing that the appellant's mark is somehow associated with the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The court is of the view that the appellant is liable for breaches under the tort of passing-off for using the design rightfully belonging to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> However, we do not intend to proceed further to deal with the issue of quantum of damages as the respondent itself had during the appeal informed the court that the respondent was not claiming for damages. In any event no damages had been assessed by the learned trial judge or Registrar of the court below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> In summary, the court sets down below its reasons for dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Accordingly, the respondent's claim was allowed to expunge the appellant's trade mark from the Register of Trade Marks under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46</LINK> as the appellant is not the proprietor nor the first user of the design. The appellant did not have a good title to the mark and the registration thereof was without legal basis. When the appellant supplied the Sports Goods bearing the design for the respondent, it had supplied them solely for the business of the respondent and none other.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In the result, the appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs. The Trade Marks Register is hereby rectified by the removal of Trade Mark Nos 09011365 and 09011366 registered in the name of the appellant.</p>
