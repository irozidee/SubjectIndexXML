    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff, as administrator of the estate of the deceased, claimed that certain land ("the land") was the native customary rights ("NCR") land of the deceased. Upon the deceased's death, the land formed part of the estate of the deceased and devolved upon the plaintiff and his siblings as beneficiaries thereof. The plaintiff filed an action claiming that sometime in 1987, the land was alienated by the defendants to Sarawak Economic Development Corporation ("SEDC") without extinguishment of the plaintiff's NCR over the land and without payment of compensation in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;15.;;">s 15 of the Land Code (Sarawak) (Cap 81) ("Land Code")</LINK>. However, the defendants sought the determination of two preliminary issues of law based on limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;33.;;">O 33 r 2 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. The High Court decided for the defendants and struck out the plaintiff's action. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court and took the view that the question for determination revolved around the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>, particularly as to the three-year limitation period prescribed therein. The Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff's cause of action accrued either in 1981, when the deceased's application for the land was refused or rejected, or in 1987 - when the plaintiff alleged that the alienation of the land to SEDC without extinguishment of the NCR of the deceased or the deceased's estate and without payment of compensation - had contravened s 15 of the Land Code. The Court of Appeal thus decided that the commencement of the action by the plaintiff was well beyond the three-year time bar prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>. The plaintiff was reckoned to have commenced his action some 15 years from 1981 or alternatively some nine years' from 1987. The plaintiff obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal was right to hold that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> should be construed together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">ss 197</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;200.;;">200</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;201.;;">201 of the Land Code</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">Sections 202</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">197 of the Land Code</LINK> are clear and ambiguous. The two sections should thus be given their natural and ordinary meaning. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> This court would agree with the Court of Appeal that the word "aforesaid" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> should be read conjunctively with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK>. To substitute the words "any land" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197</LINK> with the words "land which is registered in the Land Register or any estate or interest therein" would be adding words to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197</LINK> and would amount to asking the court to legislate by amending the section - an approach which was not permissible. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The words "any land" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> must refer to all or any of the category of land under the Land Code. The words "any person" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> must be interpreted as not intending to restrict the application of that section only to those persons whose interests are registered in the Land Registers or "registered proprietors" as provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;113.;;">s 113 of the Land Code</LINK>. The words "any person" must also apply to any native such as the plaintiff who had native customary rights and deemed to hold the land which is State land as licensee from the Government. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> To restrict the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> to only "registered land or registered interest in land" could result in an absurdity. It would then appear that NCR land owners without titles to their land could not institute an action for recovery of compensation against the government if they were deprived of their NCR land. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The plaintiff was right in contending that the alienation of the land to SEDC was unlawful as no compensation was paid by the Government under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1958_81;15.;;">s 15 of the Land Code</LINK> wherein the deceased or his estate suffered loss and damage. Upon alienation of the land to SEDC the rights of the deceased to the land had been extinguished or he had been deprived of the land and his right to seek compensation against the Government under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> accrued. His action however was barred by limitation as it was filed outside the period of limitation prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b>As the plaintiff's right to recovery of damages was barred by limitation, the declarations sought for by the plaintiff would be futile. The court would not act in vain and grant declarations that were of no utility or in regard to matters which were no longer live issues or had become academic. Once the plaintiff could not get out of the plea of limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>, the action ought to be dismissed.

    <p>
      <b>Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the Court of Appeal in dismissing the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court at Miri. The High Court allowed the respondents' application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;33.;;">O 33 r 2 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ("RHC 1980")</LINK>, wherein after determining a preliminary issue of law based on limitation, proceeded to strike out the appellant's action. The appellant was the plaintiff while the respondents were the defendants before the High Court. For convenience the parties will be referred as they were before the High Court. Leave To Appeal</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Leave to appeal was granted by this court on the following two questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiff was the administrator of the Estate of Mok bin Tuah ("deceased"). The plaintiff claimed that at all material times, that parcel of land, containing an area of about 8.51 acres situated at Miri River, Miri forming part of Lots 1314, 1315 and 1351 to 1362, Block 3 Miri Concession Land District, was the native customary rights land ("the land") of the deceased. Upon the death of the deceased, the land formed part of the estate of the deceased and  devolved upon the plaintiff and his siblings as beneficiaries thereof.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It was the plaintiff's case that sometime in 1987 the Land was alienated by the defendants to Sarawak Economic Development Corporation ("SEDC") without extinguishment of the appellant's NCR over the land and without payment of compensation in contravention of the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;15.;;">s 15 of the Land Code</LINK>. The plaintiff prayed for damages costs and other reliefs as the court thinks fit and just.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court On Preliminary Issues</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> By way of application of summons in chambers the defendants sought determination on two preliminary issues of law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;33.;;">O 33 r 2 of the RHC 1980</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The High Court allowed the defendants' summons in chambers and answered preliminary issue (b) above in the affirmative and struck out the plaintiff's action. The plaintiff thereafter appealed to the Court of Appeal against the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court and took the view that the question for determination revolved around the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>, particularly as to the three-year limitation period prescribed therein. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">Section 202 of the Land Code</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Court of Appeal was of the view that the word "aforesaid" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> requires that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202</LINK> be read conjunctively with the preceding sections, more specifically <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">ss 197</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;200.;;">200</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;201.;;">201 of the Land Code</LINK> which provide for the recovery of damages or compensation by any person who is deprived of his land. Since the plaintiff's action and his pleaded case sought to recover damages or compensation on the ground that the deceased or the deceased's estate was deprived of the land, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> clearly applied which prescribed a time bar of three years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the facts, the Court of Appeal found that plaintiff's cause of action accrued either in 1981, when the deceased's application for the land was refused or rejected; or on 21 December 1987, when the plaintiff alleged that the alienation of the land to SEDC without extinguishment of the NCR of the deceased or the deceased's estate and without payment of compensation was in contravention of s 15 of the Land Code. The plaintiff was reckoned to have commenced his action in the High Court in April 1996, some 15 years from 1981 or alternatively nine years from 1987. In either case, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the commencement of the action by the plaintiff was well beyond the three-year time bar prescribed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> As regards the prayers for the declarations sought in support of the plaintiff's claim for compensation the Court of Appeal found that these declarations were apparently weak in the sense that they lack enforceability and there could be no committal. These declarations read conjunctively with other prayers for recovery of damages came within the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions Of The Plaintiff</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that both the High Court and the Court of Appeal committed serious errors in law in arriving at the conclusion that any claim for recovery of compensation for deprivation of land was caught by limitation without ascertaining the true object of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> and the type of action for recovery of damages for loss of land at which it is directed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It was the contention of the plaintiff that applying the purposive approach to interpret <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> to ascertain the compensation claim that was caught by the words "... action for recovery of damages as aforesaid ...", it was necessary to examine the six sections preceding <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202</LINK>, namely <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">ss 197</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;201.;;">201</LINK> which together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202</LINK> come under the subheading "COMPENSATION FOR LOSS" of Part VII of the Land Code on "REGISTRATION". These statutory provisions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">ss 197</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">202 of the Land Code</LINK> all relate to or are connected to the matter of compensation for deprivation of land or an estate or interest therein arising from conferment of indefeasibility of title by the process of registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was highlighted by learned counsel for the plaintiff that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> provides that the action for recovery of damages must be by a person who is: (a) deprived of the land by reason of the provisions relating to indefeasibility under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;132.;;">ss 132</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;133.;;">133</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;134.;;">134</LINK>; and (b) barred by reason of these provisions from bringing an action for recovery of the land against the registered proprietor. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">Section 197 of the Land Code</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It was submitted for the plaintiff that the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> is to provide recourse against the Government for recovery of damages to a limited class or group of persons. The person who belongs to it must firstly, have suffered loss of his land or an estate or interest therein by "... reason of the provisions relating to indefeasibility...", that is to say, the registration process conferring indefeasibility of title and secondly, he is barred from recovering such loss against the registered proprietor who acquires the indefeasible title.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was the plaintiff's case that the limitation bar set by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> by the words "aforesaid" is only for limiting action against the Government for recovery of damages by any person arising from provisions relating to indefeasibility as spelt out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> and it did not apply to the plaintiff in the present case. This was because the plaintiff's claim for loss and damages related to issues relating to NCR lands under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">s 5(3) and (4) of the Land Code</LINK> which were not titled land. Learned counsel for the plaintiff in support of this proposition of the law cited the unreported case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1816;"><i>Jeno Jo and 2 Ors v. The State Government of Sarawak</i> [2012] MLRHU 1816</LINK>. In that case, the court considered the preceding <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">ss 197</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;201.;;">201 of the Land Code</LINK> together with marginal notes and the general headings included in "PART VII: REGISTRATION" under the sub-part "COMPENSATION FOR LOSS" and came to the conclusion that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> did not apply to the claim for loss and damage connected to extinguishment of NCR. His Lordship John Ko Wai Seng JC said at p 60 of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was also contended for the plaintiff that the interpretation given by the Court of Appeal on the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> was wrong because it would produce an unjust and absurd result. It had the effect of denying to a person entitled to native customary rights subsisting in State land the right to enforce the protection accorded by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;15.;;">s 15(1) of the Land Code</LINK> which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;15.;;">Section 15(1) of the Land Code</LINK> reinforces the legislative intent to protect native customary rights contained in the section by prohibiting alienation of State land until all native customary rights have been surrendered or terminated or provision for compensating the person entitled thereto had been made. It was submitted for the appellant that by the above statutory provision, the legislature has clearly intended that there can be no alienation of State land, in which native customary rights subsist, unless there is an extinguishment of such rights in accordance with the procedure as laid out and provision is made for payment of compensation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It was the contention of the plaintiff on the factual situation upon which the first question posed for determination by this court was premised, it was to be taken as established that the alienation of the State land to SEDC was made without extinguishment of NCR. There was no extinguishment of NCR by way of a direction of the Minister and no payment of compensation to the estate of the deceased. The above alienation of the State land was open to challenge on the ground that it was ultra vires <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;15.;;">s 15(1)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">s 5(3) of the Land Code</LINK>. Being a nullity, the alienation conferred no rights upon SEDC and it therefore did not affect the plaintiff's entitlement to native customary rights over the land. The plaintiff had the right to ignore it or to apply for it to be set aside. The action taken by the plaintiff in the instant case to claim for declarations to challenge the validity of the alienation and for damages as a consequential relief was therefore clearly outside the ambit of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> On the second question posed before this court it was submitted for the plaintiff that the Court of Appeal was wrong in taking the view that the claims for declarations were also caught by the limitation period under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>. It was the plaintiff's contention that the Court of Appeal erred in law in striking out the action without determining the claims for declarations prayed for. The plaintiff was left with no recourse except to claim for declarations to establish his native customary rights over the land in question and to determine that the alienation of the land to SEDC was a wrongful infringement of such rights by the Government. This was because the remedy of filing an action for an order for recovery of the land was not available to them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that under proviso (b) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_359;29.;;">s 29 of the Government Proceedings Act 1956</LINK> the court can only make a declaratory order as against the Government in lieu of an order for recovery of the property. Therefore, on the facts of the instant case, the declarations served a useful purpose and should not have been dismissed even if the claim for compensation were barred by limitation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It was also submitted that it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish that his deceased father had native customary rights under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;15.;;">s 15(1) of the Land Code</LINK> and the essential pre-requisite for extinguishment of the rights and the payment of compensation was that the "native customary rights shall have been lawfully created" in the State land. Therefore, there must be a determination by the court that the native customary rights had been lawfully created. In the said premises, it was the plaintiff's contention that the declarations prayed for were not purely academic. On the facts and circumstances of this case, they were necessary to establish the plaintiff's rights over the land and to determine the legality of the alienation of the land to SEDC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We shall first deal with Question (1) posed in this appeal. It is our considered view the Court of Appeal was right in holding that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> should be construed together with the preceding sections, more specifically <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">ss 197</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;200.;;">200</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;201.;;">201 of the Land Code</LINK>. Of particular importance in our present case is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197</LINK>. Both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">ss 202</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">197 of the Land Code</LINK> in our view are clear and unambiguous. Therefore, the two sections must be given their natural and ordinary meaning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We are in agreement with the finding of the Court of Appeal that the word "aforesaid" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK> should be read conjunctively with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197</LINK> which would provide for the recovery of damages or compensation by any person who is deprived of his land. The plaintiff on the other hand wanted the court in its interpretation to substitute the words "any land" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197</LINK> with the words "land which is registered in the Land Register or any estate or interest therein". To do so in our view would be adding words to the section and amounted to asking the court to legislate by amending the section. This approach is not permissible. [See the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_609;"><i>NKM Holdings Sdn Bhd v. Pan Malaysia Wood Bhd</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 609</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 39].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is to be noted under the Land Code, "land" includes (a) State land, as defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1958_81;2.;;">s 2 of the Land Code</LINK>, (b) land issued with title by way of grant or lease or provisional lease, registered under the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;113.;;">ss 113</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;114.;;">114</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;115.;;">115 of the Land Code</LINK>, and (c) Land held by natives under NCR created under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">section 5</LINK> and until a document of title issued, the natives who lawfully occupy such land (which remains State Land) are deemed to hold the same by licence from the Government. (See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">s 5(2) proviso (i) of the Land Code</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We are of the view when the Legislature uses the words "any land" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK>, it must have intended to refer to all or any of the category of land stated above. For the words "any person" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> it must be interpreted it does not intend to restrict the application of that section only to those persons whose interests are registered in the Land Registers or "registered proprietors" as provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;113.;;">s 113 of the Land Code</LINK>. The words "any person" must also apply to any native such as the plaintiff who has native customary rights and deemed to hold the land which is State land as licensee from the Government.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We are also of the view to restrict the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> to only "registered land or registered interest in land" could result in an absurdity. It would then appear that NCR land owners without titles to their land cannot institute an action for recovery of compensation against the government if they were deprived of their NCR land. With respect that could not have been the intention of the Legislature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The basis of the plaintiff's complaint is that the deceased's NCR land had been amalgamated with other land, subdivided and then, the subdivided lots which included the deceased's NCR land alienated to SEDC. The plaintiff was right in contending that the alienation of the land to SEDC was unlawful as no compensation was paid by the Government under s 15 of the Land Code wherein the deceased or his estate suffered loss and damage. We are of the view upon alienation of the land to SEDC the rights of the deceased to the land had been extinguished or he had been deprived of the land and his right to seek compensation against the Government under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;197.;;">s 197 of the Land Code</LINK> accrued. His action however was barred by limitation as it was filed outside the period of limitation prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>. On this point we agree with the finding of the Court of Appeal that the plaintiff commenced his action in the High Court in April 1996, some fifteen years from 1981 (the year the deceased's application for the land was rejected) or alternatively nine years from 1987 (the year the land was alienated to SEDC without extinguishment of the NCR). In either case the commencement of action by the plaintiff was time barred. We would therefore answer Question (1) posed in this appeal in the affirmative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We shall now deal with Question (2) posed in this appeal. We are of the view if Question (1) is answered in the affirmative and the plaintiff's right to recovery of damages barred by limitation, the declarations sought for by the plaintiff were futile. The grant of declaration is in the discretion of the court. The court will not act in vain and grant declarations that are of no utility or in regard to matters which are no longer "live issue" or has become academic. In support of this proposition we would refer to the following passage of the judgment of Wan Adnan J (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1990_1_594;"><i>Douglas A Pedley v. Majlis Ugama Islam Pulau Pinang &amp; Anor</i> [1990] 1 MLRH 594</LINK> at p 595; [1990] 2 MLJ 307; [1990] 2 CLJ 24 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Accordingly we are of the view the Court of Appeal was right in upholding the decision of the High Court that once the plaintiff cannot get out of the plea of limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code</LINK>, the action ought to be dismissed, as the only issue left would be whether the court in the exercise of its discretionary powers should grant the appellant the declaratory orders sought for. For this reason Question (2) posed in this appeal is answered in the affirmative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> For the reasons abovestated we find there is no merit in this appeal. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</p>
