    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent was the local authority of the district of Hulu Terengganu. The appellant owned a piece of land ("the property") in the respondent's district. Through a notice dated 22 May 1999, the respondent gave the appellant a notice of its intention to exercise its power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;144.;;">s 144 of the Local Government Act 1976 ("the Act")</LINK> to amend the valuation list applicable for the property. The property was revalued and assessment imposed. The appellant was not satisfied and exercised its rights of objection under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;144.;;">s 144(3) of the Act</LINK>, prompting the respondent to revise the revaluation of the property and the assessment rate. The appellant appealed to the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;145.;;">s 145 of the Act</LINK> in respect of the revaluation of the property and the assessment rates. A consent judgment was then entered whereby the appellant agreed to pay a reduced assessment rate for a period of five years. However, by letter dated 6 February 2005, the respondent sought to impose upon the appellant rates in accordance with the 1999 Valuation List. The appellant then filed an application for judicial review in the High Court which the court allowed. On appeal by the respondent, the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's decision and allowed the appeal. Hence, the present appeal by the appellant. The issues for the Federal Court's determination were: (i) whether there was a new Valuation List prepared by the respondent; and (ii) whether the respondent had adopted the 1999 Valuation List for the year 2005 assessment rates and had succeeded in furnishing evidence of any extension order as determined by the State Authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Giving the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137 of the Act</LINK> its plain and ordinary meaning, it was clear that before the expiry of the five-year period, the local authority would have to prepare either a new Valuation List or take steps for the existing list to be extended by the State Authority. Following the 1999 Valuation List, the respondent should have prepared a new Valuation List, at the latest by 2004. For the respondent to rely on the 1999 Valuation List, there should have been evidence of an extension by the State Authority for the extended use of the 1999 Valuation List. In the instant case, the respondent had failed to produce credible evidence to show that the 1999 Valuation List had been adopted by way of an extension order by the State Authority. Further, if the respondent had prepared a new Valuation List or had adopted and relied on the 1999 Valuation List under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137</LINK> by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141 of the Act</LINK>, the respondent was duty bound to notify the appellant of its reliance on such a Valuation List that had been prepared or adopted. (paras 13-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondent was wrong in relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137(2) of the Act</LINK> to justify its action in not giving a notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141 of the Act</LINK> and in taking the position that the 1999 Valuation List was still in force and for that reason it was not necessary to give the said notice. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">Section 137(2) of the Act</LINK> should not be read in isolation, but ought to be read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">ss 137(3)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">141 of the Act</LINK>. It is a principle of interpretation of statutes that the words used in a section must be given their plain grammatical meaning. Where the court is dealing with two subsections of a section it is necessary that the two subsections must be construed as a whole. The two subsections must be read as parts of an integral whole and as being inter-dependent. The provisions for <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;142.;;">ss 142</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;145.;;">145 of the Act</LINK> had also to be considered in relation to the statutory right of the appellant to object and appeal with regard to the Valuation List and the assessment rates. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The consent judgment recorded between the parties was clearly not based on the 1999 Valuation List. Any subsequent reliance on the 1999 Valuation List would tantamount to a new Valuation List. The consent judgment recorded was clearly based on a reduced valuation of the property. It was therefore clear that the 1999 Valuation List had been amended and could not have been the basis of assessment for the period from 1999 to 2004. (paras 17-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The respondent was entitled to rely on the 1999 Valuation List for the year of assessment 2005 or any year of assessment thereafter. However, such a reliance would constitute a "new" Valuation List and the respondent had to comply with the procedure prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">ss 141</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;142.;;">142</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;145.;;">145 of the Act</LINK> by giving the necessary notice of a new Valuation List and giving the appellant a right to be heard. In the circumstances of the instant case, the respondent was in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141(3) of the Act</LINK> by unilaterally relying on the 1999 Valuation List, which amounted to a new Valuation List, in imposing the assessment rates for the year of assessment 2005 and in failing to give the requisite notice to the appellant.

    <p>
      <b>Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin CJM:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the Court of Appeal in reversing the decision of the High Court. The High Court Judge had granted an order-in-terms of the appellant's application for judicial review, <i>inter alia</i>, for a declaration that the respondent's Notice of Assessment dated 6 February 2005 issued in respect of the appellant's property where a hydroelectric station has been erected is null and void for non-compliance of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141(3) of the Local Government Act 1976 ("the Act")</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Leave To Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant obtained leave to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The relevant background facts of the case are these. The appellant owns a piece of land held under Lot PT 5068 Mukim Jenagor in the District of Hulu Terengganu ("the property") upon which a hydroelectric station has been erected. The respondent is the local authority of the District of Hulu Terengganu. The dispute between the appellant and the respondent stemmed from the 1999 valuation notice issued by the respondent. Vide notice dated 22 May 1999 the respondent gave the appellant a notice of its intention to exercise its power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;144.;;">s 144 of the Act</LINK> to amend the Valuation List applicable for the property. The property was revalued by the respondent at RM63,600,000.00 and consequently imposed an assessment rate of RM5,088,000.00 per annum. The appellant exercised its right of objection under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;144.;;">s 144(3) of the Act</LINK> and objected to the assessment. The respondent revised the valuation of the said property to RM62,400,000.00 and the assessment rate to RM4,992,000.00. The appellant then vide Kuala Terengganu Originating Motion No: 25-08-1999 ["the 1999 OM"] appealed to the High Court in respect of the revaluation of the property and the assessment rates pursuant to the right of appeal conferred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;145.;;">s 145 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The 1999 OM was settled by a consent judgment dated 9 April 2000. According to this consent judgment the appellant was required to pay the respondent a reduced assessment rate, that is RM2,000,000.00 per annum for a period of five years ending on 30 Jun 2004. A year later vide Kuala Terengganu High Court Civil Suit No: 22-41-2001 the respondent applied to set aside the consent judgment ["the 2001 Civil Suit"]. At the time of filing of the application for judicial review (which is the subject matter of this appeal before us) this 2001 Civil Suit was still pending before the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> By a letter dated 6 February 2005 the respondent sought to impose upon the appellant rates in accordance with the 1999 Valuation List for the period commencing July 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 12 January 2006 the appellant, vide Kuala Terengganu High Court Judicial Review Application No: 13-01-2006, which application was subsequently amended applied for leave to apply for the following orders:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The High Court allowed the appellant's application for judicial review. The learned judge ruled that the annual value and assessment rate sought to be adopted and imposed by the respondent dated 6 February 2005 was invalid on the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Court of Appeal in reversing the decision of the High Court in its judgment made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Contention Of The Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It was the contention of the appellant that the respondent had failed to send notice of their intention to amend the valuation of the said property subsequent to the entry of the consent judgment. The appellant was accordingly denied of their statutory right to object under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;142.;;">s 142 of the Act</LINK> and subsequently to appeal to the High Court for determination under s 145 of the Act. It was the appellants' case that the respondent was duty bound to prepare a new Valuation List once every five years or within such extended time period as the State Authority may determine. On the facts of this case there was no evidence to support the respondent's case of the State Authority having extended the 1999 Valuation List.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> For the respondent it was contended that there was no necessity for a new Valuation List to be prepared and for a notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;144.;;">s 144(2) of the Act</LINK> to be issued to the appellant. The respondent was still relying on the gazetted 1999 Valuation List which was in force upon the same being extended to 2008 by the State Authority pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137(2) and (3) of the Act</LINK>. It was also argued that the consent judgment did not amend or vary the valuation of the property as it was only in relation to the assessment rates and not the valuation of the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We are of the view the principal issue to be decided in this appeal is whether there was a new Valuation List prepared by the respondent as the local authority for the purpose of the issuance of the Notice of Assessment dated 6 February 2005 for the year 2005 assessment rates. It has also to be determined whether the respondent had in fact adopted the 1999 Valuation List for the year 2005 assessment rates and have succeeded in furnishing evidence of any extension order as determined by the State Authority of the said 1999 Valuation List.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It is noted the requirements set out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137(3) of the Act</LINK> is that a new Valuation List shall be prepared and completed once every five years or within such extended time period as the State Authority may determine. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">Section 137 of the Act</LINK> contains provisions relating to the Valuation List as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Giving the words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137 of the Act</LINK> its plain and ordinary meaning it is clear that before the expiry of the five years period the local authority shall prepare either a new Valuation List or take steps for the existing list to be extended by the State Authority. Following the 1999 Valuation List it would appear that a new Valuation List should have been prepared by the respondent latest by the year 2004. For the respondent to rely on the 1999 Valuation List there should have been evidence of an extension by the State Authority for the extended use of the 1999 Valuation List.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We are of the view the respondent has failed to produce credible supporting evidence to support its contention that the 1999 Valuation List has been adopted by way of an extension order by the State Authority. We find that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the respondent's letter dated 15 June 2005 to the appellant can be accepted as evidence that the 1999 Valuation List had been extended by the State Authority. We are of the view that the respondent's letter dated 15 June 2005 was only a reply by the Yang Di Pertua, Majllis Daerah Hulu Terengganu to the appellant in response to the objection made by the appellant to the respondent with regard to the annual value of the subject property and the Notice of Assessment issued. The respondent has failed to furnish any credible evidence such as the extract copy of the decision of the Majlis Mesyuarat Kerajaan Negeri Terenganu (the State Authority) and its gazette notification to support its contention that the 1999 Valuation List had been extended by the State Authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We are also of the view that if the respondent had prepared a new Valuation List or had adopted and relied on the 1999 Valuation List under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137</LINK> by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141 of the Act</LINK>, the respondent was duty bound to notify the appellant of its reliance on such a Valuation List that had been prepared or adopted. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">Section 141 of the Act</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We are of the view the respondent was wrong in relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137(2) of the Act</LINK> to justify its action in not giving a notice under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141 of the Act</LINK> and in taking the position that the 1999 Valuation List was still in force and for that reason it was not necessary to give the said notice. We are of the view <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137(2) of the Act</LINK> should not be read in isolation, but has to be read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;137.;;">s 137(3)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141 of the Act</LINK>. It is a principle of interpretation of statutes that the words used in a section must be given their plain grammatical meaning. Where the court is dealing with two sub-sections of a section it is necessary that the two subsections must be construed as a whole. The two sub-sections must be read as parts of an integral whole and as being inter-dependent. (See the case of <i>Madanlal Fakirchand Dudhediya v. Shree Changdeo Sugar Mills Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [1962] AIR SC 1543). The provisions for <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;142.;;">ss 142</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;145.;;">145 of the Act</LINK> have also to be considered in relation to the statutory right of the appellant to object and appeal with regard to the Valuation List and the assessment rates.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> As to the consequence of the consent judgment dated 9 April 2000 entered into between the appellant and the respondent in the 1999 OM in respect of the assessment rates imposed by the respondent we are of the view that consent judgment was clearly not based on the 1999 Valuation List. Any subsequent reliance on the 1999 Valuation List in our considered opinion would tantamount to a new Valuation List.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The consent judgment recorded was clearly based on a reduced valuation of the property. It is therefore clear that the 1999 Valuation List had been amended and could not have been the basis of assessment for the period from 1999 to 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We are of the view that the respondent was entitled to rely on the 1999 Valuation List for the year of assessment 2005 or any year of assessment thereafter. However, we agree with the submission of learned counsel for the appellant that such a reliance would constitute a "new" Valuation List and the respondent must comply with the procedure prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">ss 141</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;142.;;">142</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;145.;;">145 of the Act</LINK> by giving the necessary notice of a new Valuation List and the appellant given a right to be heard. In the circumstances of this case it is our finding that the respondent was in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;141.;;">s 141(3) of the Act</LINK> by unilaterally relying on the 1999 Valuation List, which amounted to a new Valuation List in imposing the assessment rates for the year of assessment 2005 and in failing to give the requisite notice to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> For the reasons abovestated we would answer the questions posed for our determination in this appeal as follows. Questions Number 1, 2, 3 and 5 are answered in the negative. Questions Number 4 and 6 are answered in the affirmative. We would also make an order that pending the hearing of the appellant's objection and appeal, the appellant would be directed to pay the assessment rate under the consent judgment until it is superceded by a new Valuation List. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs. The Order of the Court of Appeal is hereby set aside and consequently the Order of the High Court is restored as varied.</p>
