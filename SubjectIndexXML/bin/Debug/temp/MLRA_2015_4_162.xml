    <p>The appellant bank ("the appellant") appealed against the decision of the High Court in dismissing its claim against the respondent to recover outstanding sums for overdraft facilities granted to the respondent to finance a housing project on the ground that the civil suit filed was time-barred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1953 ("the Act")</LINK>. On the other hand, the respondent crossappealed to vary the order of the High Court to hold that the appellant's claim was also time-barred based on the date of the notices of demand. Accordingly, the issues to be decided were, whether the appellant's claim was statute-barred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Act</LINK>; and whether this was a fit and proper case for appellate intervention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> If parties were mutually willing to negotiate and to extend facilities notwithstanding a breach or default, it was a misapplication of the Act to limit the time for negotiations or to extend further facilities to the time allowed to file civil proceedings under the Act. In this case, the High Court allowed itself to be led by the submissions on accrual of cause of action from the issue of the notices of demand. However, the High Court failed to appreciate that although there were defaults, the parties continued to deal with each other; the offers of facilities by banks were only issued after consideration of and in response to applications for facilities or further facilities by an applicant or borrower; the exchange of letters and issue of offers of facilities testified to ongoing negotiations as to settlement and extension of further facilities; and that it would be inequitable to allow the respondent to turn around and to rely upon the defaults that led to further offers of facilities as the date of accrual of the cause of action for the purposes of limitation. (paras 17-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant appeal, the error led the High Court to a decision it would not have made had it not been for the error. It was therefore a fit and proper case within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> demanding appellate intervention to correct the injustice.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant RHB Bank Berhad appealed to this court against the dismissal of its claim against the respondent Kwan Chew Holdings Sdn Bhd to recover <i>inter alia</i> the total outstanding amount from the facility of RM1,932,816.83 due as at 29 February 1996.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent cross-appealed, seeking to vary the order of the High Court as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Having heard the parties on their respective appeal and cross-appeal, this court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The reasons follow below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The primary issue before the High Court and on appeal was whether theappellant's claim is statute-barred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, in that the action has been brought after the expiration of six years from which the cause of action accrued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> A secondary issue was whether any expiry of the limitation period (if any, which was denied by the plaintiff) has been revived by the defendant's subsequent acceptance of further funds from the plaintiff and by the defendant's acceptance of the 5<sup>th</sup> letter of offer dated 19 April 1990 on 8 May 1990.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">Section 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1953 (Revised 1981) Act 254</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In this case, the subject matter concerns outstanding sums for overdraft facilities granted to finance a housing project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The writ was filed on 5 April 1996. The filing of the writ gave occasion for submissions in this case, not as to liability or quantum, but as to whether the action is time-barred</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> For the appellant, it was submitted that time began to run from 19 April 1990 for the reason that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> For the respondent, it was submitted that time began to run from 28 December 1985. From that, the submission went on to refer to para 8 of the statement of claim that the respondent was given notices of default in 1985 (RR3:224) and 1986 (RR3:234). The latter giving notice that if the excess of RM113,248.38 as at 23 February 1986 was not settled within seven days, the appellant would not hesitate to institute appropriate legal action. The submission pursued with the argument that the letter of 19 April 1990 for further bridging finance of RM45,000.00 to secure Certificate of Fitness for Occupation had referred to the release of RM2,000.00 having been made on 8 December 1989, and provided for the release of RM43,000.00 subject to conditions but the conditions imposed upon the respondent was never met. Though it was accepted on 18 May 1990 and a copy returned with signature, the conditions were never met by the respondent. Thus, it was submitted that time ran from 8 December 1989, and</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The respondent's cross-appeal is based upon the argument that time ran from 8 December 1989.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Consideration And Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The cross-appeal seeking to set aside the order for the respondent to pay the appellant RM2,000.00 with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of judgment to date of realisation be set aside may be dealt with shortly by reference to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_162;"><i>RHB Bank Bhd v. Kwan Chew Holdings Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 162</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 188; [2010] 1 CLJ 665 not brought to our attention by the respondent but by the appellant. At para [45] of the judgment, the Federal Court held on the failure to release the full RM45,000.00:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The second part of the cross-appeal was that the High Court ought to have held not only that the appellant's civil suit was time-barred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, but also that the appellant's claim was time-barred arising from the letter dated 6 February 1985 which constituted a notice of demand and accordingly the plaintiff 's cause of action against the defendant arose at that time and the writ which was filed on 5 April 1996 was statute-barred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We deal with the second part of the respondent's cross-appeal together with the appellant's appeal as both concerns the Limitation Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Limitation Act</LINK> restricts the maximum time within which legal proceedings may be instituted. That maximum time is calculated from the time the cause of action accrued. It is trite that a cause of action accrues at the earliest time when all the necessary or material facts that make up the elements of the cause have occurred or are in place. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_653;"><i>Tan Kong Min v. Malaysian Nasional Insurance Sdn Bhd</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 653</LINK>; [2006] 1 MLJ 601; [2005] 3 CLJ 825; [2005] 4 AMR 745, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_293;"><i>Credit Corp (M) Bhd. v. Fong Tak Sin</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 293</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 409; [1991] 1 CLJ 69 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1970_1_363;"><i>Nasri v. Mesah</i> [1970] 1 MLRA 363</LINK>; [1971] 1 MLJ 32. Even if a person has a valid claim, that claim can no longer be validly filed once the period of limitation has passed. If one aspect of the principle of justice is that a person with a valid claim is entitled to litigate, the other aspect of the same principle is that there must be a limit to the time within which a person is exposed to the risk of being sued. But it is not intended to tie down the hands of parties that the only way to recover loss is by litigation, as that would defeat the benefit of the Limitation Act to reduce claims under litigation before the courts. Hence, understanding the accrual of a cause of action is the key to a fair and just application of the principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> A cause of action does not accrue the moment a loan amount or part thereof is received by the borrower or paid out on his account, although that is the amount he eventually has to pay back with interest and costs as applicable under the terms of the loan. It does not accrue because there is a breach or default unless the agreement specifies that it accrues from the point of time of breach or default. But even so, if the parties mutually discuss and negotiate, it implicitly means that they are extending the date when payment becomes due and the cause of action accrues. There is no statutory or equitable limit within which a party can negotiate or to extend further any facilities. If parties are mutually willing to negotiate and to extend facilities notwithstanding a breach or default, it is a misapplication of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Limitation Act</LINK> to limit the time for negotiations or to extend further facilities to the time allowed to file civil proceedings under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The High Court, in this case, allowed itself to be led by the submissions on accrual of cause of action from the issue of the notice(s) of demand. The High Court failed to appreciate:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> With respect, the error led the High Court to a decision it would not have made had it not been for the error. It was therefore a fit and proper case within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> demanding appellate intervention to correct the injustice. That being the case, the cross-appeal necessarily fails.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Accordingly, we allowed the appeal and dismissed the cross-appeal on terms as above set out at para 3.</p>
