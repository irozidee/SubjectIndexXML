    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant failed or refused to pay progress payments in accordance with a sale and purchase agreement between the appellant and the respondent ("the contract") for the purchase of a bungalow with a courtyard on the basis that as a result of the use of Form H instead of the prescribed Form G, a strata title could not be issued for the bungalow. Accordingly, notices of termination were issued by the respondent, however, the appellant still refused to pay the installments. Consequently, the respondent terminated the contract and forfeited the deposit paid by the appellant. The appellant's claim in the High Court for, amongst others, a declaration that the contract was illegal and void for being in violation of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 ("the Act")</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;11.;;">reg 11(1) of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 ("the Regulations")</LINK>, was dismissed. In the instant appeal, the issues to be decided were, whether the use of the wrong form rendered the contract between the parties null and void; and whether the appellant's purported concern about the document of title was a justified ground for not making or refusing to make the progress payments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the use of Form H instead of Form G was a contravention as to the form of sale and purchase agreement to be used for the contract between the parties. However, the contravention did not go to the substance of the contract. The mandatory language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;11.;;">reg 11(1) of the Regulations</LINK> prescribing the use of Form G or Form H did not extend to declaring that the contract under any form other than Form G or Form H to be null and void. Indeed, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;22.;;">s 22 of the Act</LINK> provided that a contract was not voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in Malaysia, as would be the case if the use of the wrong form was a mistake as to the law in force. Accordingly, since the contravention as to the form to be used did not affect the object of the contract between the parties, being the delivery of a bungalow with a courtyard as contracted, the contravention did not render the contract between the parties to be null and void. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The obvious solutions when the wrong form was used were either to terminate the Form H agreement and demand a refund or execute an agreement in the correct form and to backdate its date of effectiveness. In this instance, the appellant did neither and failed or refused to make further progress payments. Even after receiving a direct assurance from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government that the law was being amended to allow for the issue of stratified title, the appellant continued to maintain her purported concern, giving notice that she would take legal action without offering to make the progress payments. Furthermore, the respondent was only required to make an application for issue of strata title within six months after the certificate of fitness for occupation was obtained. That had not yet occurred. Hence, the appellant's concerns were premature. (paras 31, 33, 34, 35 &amp; 36)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in the High Court, Audrey Gertrude De Souza ("the appellant") appealed against the dismissal with cost by that court of the civil suit commenced by the appellant together with four other plaintiffs, for orders, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background is briefly as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision In High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The High Court, having briefly set out the background and the cases for the plaintiff and the defendant, and before making its findings, considered the issues:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Having read the written submissions and heard the parties, we found no error, defect or irregularity in the findings that there was no inducement upon the appellant from the respondent to enter into the Schedule H agreement, that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondent dissuaded her from obtaining independent legal advice, that the property upon which the bungalow with courtyard purchased was to be built was encumbered without the appellant's consent was baseless, and the plaintiff's claim was not <i>mala fide</i>. We found no error, defect or irregularity in the reasoning and decision of the High Court as would affect the merits and thereby warrant appellate intervention as to whether by using Schedule H, the sale and purchase agreement is illegal and void for being in violation of the said <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;;">Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Our reasons follow.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Case For The Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We took into consideration the appellant's written submissions (AWS: Para 18ff) that its case was that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Submissions For The Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We took into consideration the submissions for the appellant before this court that "The question for this Honourable Court to consider, which the learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate and give due consideration" under the following headings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Submissions For The Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We took into consideration the respondent's summing up of the appellant's claim in the High Court, and the respondent's submissions before this court, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Regulations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We examined the said regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The sale and purchase took place on 29 July 2004. At the time <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;11.;;">reg 11(1) of the said Regulations</LINK> provided that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was amended by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2007_395;;">Housing Development (Control and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2007 (PU(A)395/07)</LINK> to the present form:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Taking the facts and the submissions into consideration as a whole, we observed that although the defence was that the development was a stratified development, it was an agreed fact between the parties that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Quite clearly the correct sale and purchase agreement in the circumstances of a bungalow with courtyard would have been in Form G, and not Form H. The wrong form was used.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The direct and precise issue is, therefore, the effect of the contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;11.;;">reg 11(1)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Contravention Of Regulations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The then applicable <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;11.;;">subregulation (1)</LINK> was worded in mandatory language as to the form to be used. Effectively, the terms set out in the respective forms were the terms sanctioned by the regulations for each type of sale and purchase agreement and to be addressed in such agreement. Further, the preamended general <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;13.;;">reg 13</LINK> as to penalties would apply where there is any contravention of the said Regulations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We addressed our consideration to the question that this poses: whether a sale and purchase agreement in Form H, when it should have been in Form G, renders the sale and purchase agreement in Form H (a) null and void or alternatively (b) voidable at the option of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We bear in mind this was not a case of a form other than Form G or Form H being used, but there was use of the wrong Form. Even if neither Form G nor Form H was used, contravention merely subjects the contravener to the penalty of a fine under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;13.;;">reg 13</LINK>. Nowhere in the said <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;;">Act</LINK> or the said Regulations is it declared that a contravention of the said Regulations by the use of the wrong Form, thereby attracting a fine, renders the sale and purchase agreement under the wrong Form to be null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Moreover, the said Regulations was made by the Minister pursuant to the power given under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;24.;;">s 24 of the said Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;24.;;">Section 24</LINK> gave discretion to the Minister to make regulations for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the said <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;;">Act</LINK>, and in particular and without prejudice to the generality of that power to, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The purpose of the said <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;;">Act</LINK> is stated to be to provide for the control and licensing of the business of housing development in Peninsular Malaysia and for matters connected therewith. A perusal of the said <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;;">Act</LINK> shows that the provisions are as to licensing and control of housing developers and developments for the protection of purchasers. The provisions are designed to protect the purchaser and to ensure delivery of the house or unit contracted for. To render the contract between the parties null and void because of a contravention of the said Regulations, does not serve that object of protecting the purchaser and ensuring delivery of the house or unit in accordance with the contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The question turns upon the distinction between unlawful and illegal. Adding to the problem is that the two words unlawful and illegal are often used interchangeably. It brings to mind <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909. In that case, it was held that the second order by the court, even though sealed but in breach of s 13 of the Malay Reservations Enactment 1933, was an order that was in breach of the provisions of written law, and since the court has no power to make an order in breach of the provisions of written law, the second order was illegal and utterly void. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_1_517;"><i>CIMB Investment Bank Berhad v. Metroplex Holdings Sdn Bhd</i> [2015] 1 MLRA 517</LINK>; [2014] 9 CLJ 1012, it was reiterated that unless the order is a nullity in the sense as enunciated in <i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd (supra)</i> it could not be attacked.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In this case, use of Form H instead of Form G was a contravention as to the form of sale and purchase agreement to be used for the contract between the parties for the sale and purchase of the Lot 16 bungalow and courtyard property. The contravention did not go to the substance of the contract. The mandatory language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1989_058;11.;;">reg 11(1)</LINK> prescribing the use of Form G or Form H did not extend to declaring that the contract under any form other than Form G or Form H to be null and void. Indeed, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;22.;;">s 22</LINK> provides that a contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in Malaysia, as would be the case if the use of the wrong form is a mistake as to the law in force.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We concluded that since the contravention as to the Form to be used does not affect the object of the contract between the parties, being the delivery of a bungalow with courtyard on Lot 16 as contracted, the contravention did not render the contract between the parties to be null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> That the contravention renders the contract voidable, although prayed for as an alternative order, is largely academic for the reason there is no evidence adduced and not objected to that the appellant had terminated the Form H agreement on that ground. The appellant's solicitor's letter of 20 February 2006, replying to the respondent's, notice of termination sought reconsideration. If there had been a prior termination by the appellant, one would expect it to be disclosed or raised in the reply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellant's Failure Or Refusal To Pay</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Since in any sale and purchase payment is a fundamental term, failure or refusal to make the payments as agreed is always a serious issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We observed there are, as pleaded and submitted, differences in the terms between Form G and Form H. But those differences arise from inherent differences between purchase of a landed property and a strata unit. But effectively as between the parties in this case, the particular property being sold and purchased, ie a bungalow with a courtyard as described, the price, the payment of deposit and of progress payments according to a schedule would not have been different. What was purchased did not become another merely because the wrong form was used.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We also observed that when the bungalow with courtyard was completed, the only document of title that could be issued would in any case be that which is in accordance with the law. That the respondent produced the usual document of title for a bungalow with courtyard in accordance with the law instead of a strata title is hardly any ground of complaint of breach of contract, for the purchase was of the bungalow with courtyard and not the document of title itself. What is the form of the relevant document of title for the Lot 16 bungalow with courtyard is immaterial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The appellant's argument was, as summed up in her letter of 5 October 2005, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Although the loan solicitors may have questioned whether a strata title could be issued, the issue was the description of the title, but not failure of the security itself. The bungalow with courtyard as contracted would have the same value regardless of the form of the document of title by which it was held.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We observed that paras 7 and 8 of the appellant's letter dated 5 October 2005 betray that the non-payment did not result from the bank or its loan solicitor's concerns about the security, but it was the appellant who stopped the processing of loan documents:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Likewise, the pleadings show that it was primarily the appellant's purported concern about the document of title that was the ground for not making payment. In our view, if the ground relied upon for the purported concern is not wellfounded, then the appellant had no good reason for her failure or refusal to make payment and the termination and forfeiture would be justified in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The obvious solutions when the wrong form is used and pointed out by the appellant's loan solicitors are either (a) the appellant seeks to terminate the Form H agreement and demand a refund, or (b) to execute an agreement in the correct form and to backdate its date of effectiveness to the 29 July 2004, since payments had been paid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It was pleaded at para 18 of the amended statement of claim that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> If the parties could not come to an agreement on the latter, the appellant was obviously left with no choice but to seek to terminate the Form H agreement and demand full refund.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We observed that the appellant did neither. A final reminder to pay progressive payment was issued 30 September 2005. The respondent's letter of 29 November 2005 had made clear the concern that the respondent would be able to discharge its contractual obligations, was being attended to. The 9 February 2006 letter from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government to the appellant was not only explicit and confirmed that amendments were being made, but also that the respondent needed to make application for issue of strata title only within six months after the certificate of fitness for occupation was obtained. That had not yet occurred. Her concerns then were, therefore, premature as the time for seeking issue of the title had not arrived. Instead, the appellant had failed or refused to make further payments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Considering the facts as a whole, this was a case where the respondent proceeded to sell a bungalow with courtyard under a stratified development before the law had provision for such title. It was the early days of the gated community concept, a horizontal adaptation of the vertical strata development. The appellant was a nominee buyer for her husband who knew of that. The Form H was signed before the law was amended. But even after receiving a direct assurance from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government that the law was being amended to allow for the issue of stratified title for the bungalow with courtyard as contracted, the appellant continued to maintain her purported concern, giving notice she would take legal action without offering to make the instalment payments. We note that the requisite titles had been issued in accordance with the agreement in Form H.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The notices of termination were dated 6 February 2006 and 27 February 2006. The letter from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government was dated 9 February 2006. What was a premature concern, became an academic concern from 9 February 2006. That the appellant had not at any time after 9 February 2006 attempted to tender payments albeit belatedly, but instead issued a solicitor's letter dated 20 February 2006 giving notice to take legal action for the termination inexorably led to be askant whether the present case is painstakingly maintained, not for the delivery of the bungalow with courtyard as purchased, but was against the forfeiture of the deposit, and for good measure damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal with costs in the sum of RM10,000.00 and ordered deposit to be to account of costs. We made the further order that the balance of security for costs to be refunded.</p>
