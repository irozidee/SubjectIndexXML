    <p>The appellant is a wholly owned subsidiary of a German global banking and financial services company. The 1st respondent is an investment holding company listed on the Bursa Malaysia. The 2nd respondent was a subsidiary of the 1st respondent and a credit and charge card company in Malaysia. In August 2007, the respondents sought underwriters for commercial papers and medium term notes ('Notes') for a credit card funding program and bridge financing, pending the establishment of an asset-based securitisation structure ('ABS') secured on the 2nd respondent's receivables. The 1st respondent appointed the appellant as its exclusive Lead Arranger and Lead Manager to provide advisory services for financing secured on a portfolio of credit card receivables of the 2nd respondent. By a letter dated 8 October 2007 ('the mandate letter'), the appellant accepted the appointment. Clause 7 of the mandate letter significantly provided that a separate agreement was to be executed if the appellant opted to underwrite the Notes or provide financing. An exchange of emails/letters thereafter between the parties led to a draft subscription agreement ('SA') to be executed between the appellant and the 2nd respondent. The SA provided that the appellant would provide the 2nd respondent with bridge financing of up to RM600m pending the establishment of the ABS. Whilst amendments proposed were yet to be resolved, the 2nd respondent executed the SA on 2 November 2007. The appellant, however, did not execute the SA. The respondents then asserted that an agreement was concluded on the bridge financing and pursued an action for general damages for breach of contract, amongst others. The appellant claimed that its internal credit approval, which was a prerequisite to the SA, was not obtained and hence there was no concluded contract. The High Court in favour of the appellant held, amongst others, that the SA was not a contract since the appellant did not sign it. The Court of Appeal held otherwise finding, amongst others, that a separate agreement as envisaged in cl 7 of the mandate letter came into being in the form of the SA, and therefore the SA was a concluded contract. The appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Clause 7 of the mandate letter provided that a separate agreement should be executed if the appellant were to underwrite the Notes or provide financing. Therefore, the mandate letter could not be the agreement. If the appellant were to provide financing, the SA would be that separate agreement as envisaged in the mandate letter. Even if the SA was that separate agreement, it did not follow that there was a binding contract for there were conditions to be fulfilled. (paras 48-49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> When read as a whole, the mandate letter was a composite of bargains. It was a bargain on advisory services and a bargain for the formation of a binding contract, ie if the appellant were to finance and if the conditions in cl 7 were fulfilled. While the appellant was the Lead Arranger and Lead Manager, it had the option to underwrite the Notes or provide financing. If the appellant so opted to underwrite the Notes or provide the financing, then cl 7 stipulated that the terms and conditions of such a transaction would be subject to a separate agreement. Clause 7 further provided that nothing in the mandate letter shall be construed as an obligation on the part of the appellant to provide financing. For that commitment by the appellant, there must be a separate agreement. (para 50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The separate agreement envisaged in cl 7 of the mandate letter was subject to eight conditions which must be fulfilled before any separate agreement could bind the appellant. Of the pertinent conditions, condition (g) required internal credit approval whilst condition (h) required the completion and execution of a separate agreement. Even if internal credit approval was obtained, which the appellant disputed, the requirement of a completed and executed separate agreement remained unfulfilled. The parties plainly contemplated the execution of a separate agreement as a pre-requisite to the conclusion of a binding contract. There was nothing in any of the correspondence or emails to suggest that the appellant waived the formality of an executed agreement. (paras 50-51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Clause 7 was the bridge from the mandate letter to the separate agreement. It was an integral part of the mandate letter and the bargain for the formation of a binding contract. It was only pertinent and alive when parties were in negotiations. If the separate agreement came into being as a binding contract, there was no reason to incorporate cl 7 into the SA, which had served its purpose. There was no binding contract if cl 7 was unfulfilled. The execution of the SA was an agreed term for the formation of a binding contract. The formality of an executed agreement was by clear choice. The appellant did not sign the SA and so there was no binding agreement. (para 52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The question whether the parties reached consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms on 2 November 2007 could only be gleaned from the mandate letter, the emails, letters and conduct of the parties. The correspondence however showed there was no consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms. The internal credit approval requirement, which was always at the forefront of negotiations, was not satisfied. So too the execution of a separate agreement not satisfied which was a prerequisite for a binding contract. (paras 53 &amp; 73)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The proposed amendments to the SA were substantive amendments. Where the contracting parties had a binding contract, a novation agreement or other document would have to serve to amend the terms of the contract. But here the appellant did not execute the SA. If there were amendments to the SA, the simplest and most sensible thing to do was to amend the SA accordingly. The contemporaneous evidence attested that the appellant was yet to commit to the SA at the material time. That was the consistent stand of the appellant from beginning to end. (paras 65 &amp; 78)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The intention of the parties was to make a concluded bargain after the execution of the SA. The formality of an executed agreement was by choice. The court should give effect to that intention and not foist an informal contract, which was not the practice of financial institutions and was highly unlikely in complex and intricate bargains, upon the appellant. Even if consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms was reached, it remained that conditions (g) and (h) of the SA were not fulfilled, and even if condition (g) was fulfilled, there was no executed agreement to bring about a binding contract. The claim could not succeed. (para 80)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Unless required by law, the formality of an executed agreement was an exception rather than the rule. Where there was no executed agreement, the court would be required to find whether negotiations and exchanges had crystallised into a concluded, albeit informal, contract. Each case must turn on its own facts. (para 81)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> Unless required by law, there was no rule that a complex and intricate bargain could not be concluded by an informal contract. To ensure that no premature binding contract was concluded through negotiations and exchanges, whether written or oral, it should be made amply clear that all negotiations and exchanges were subject to contract, and that parties were not bound until execution and exchange of a formal contract. In the present case, there was no concluded contract. The absence of an executed agreement was an agreed element for the formation of a binding contract. Both parties must sign the SA. Additionally, the mandate letter stipulated that it was open to either party, at any time before the entry into such a formal contract, to withdraw from the negotiations. By that, the mandate letter provided for the application of <i>locus poenitentiae</i>. (paras 80 &amp; 82)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Leave was granted to the appellant/defendant (Deutsche) to appeal against the order of the Court of Appeal in respect of the matter decided by the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, on the following nine 'questions of law':</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts could be summarised as follows. Deutsche is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, a German global banking and financial services giant with its headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany. The 1st respondent is an investment holding company listed on the Bursa Malaysia. At the material time, the 2nd respondent, a credit and charge card company in Malaysia, was a subsidiary of the 1st respondent. In August 2007, the respondents (hereinafter collectively referred to MBf) sought underwriters for its commercial papers and medium term notes (hereinafter collectively referred to as Notes) that made up its credit card funding programme, and bridge financing, pending the establishment of an asset-based securitisation structure (ABS) secured on the 2nd respondent's receivables. The 1st respondent appointed Deutsche as its exclusive Lead Arranger and Lead Manager to provide advisory services for financing secured on a portfolio of credit card receivables of the 2nd respondent. By a letter dated 8 October 2007 (which the parties referred to as the mandate letter), Deutsche accepted that appointment and spelt out the services to be provided by Deutsche, the fees and expenses payable by the 1st respondent for the advisory services, and the preconditions for termination and or expiry of the appointment of Deutsche. Those latter provisions are not significant to this appeal. But of the essence is cl 7 of the mandate letter, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> After the mandate letter had been accepted by the 1st respondent, there ensued, between the latter half of October 2007 to the beginning of November 2007, a frenetic exchange of emails/letters between the parties/solicitors, and/ or internal emails, which led to the preparation of a subscription agreement (SA) to be entered into between Deutsche of one part and the 2nd respondent of the other part. Three drafts of the SA which provided that Deutsche would provide the 2nd respondent with bridge financing of up to RM600m, pending the establishment of the said ABS, were prepared and exchanged for approval. 'Variations' were sought. While those were yet unresolved, the 2nd respondent executed the SA on 2 November 2007. But the SA was not executed by Deutsche.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Although the SA was not executed by Deutsche, MBf asserted that an agreement had been reached between Deutsche and the 2nd respondent on the aforesaid bridge financing. MBf pursued an action for general damages for breach of contract and misrepresentation, and for special damages in the sum of RM1m. Deutsche's defence was that its internal credit approval had not been obtained and that there was no concluded contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The core issue, according to the trial court, was whether the SA, which was only signed by the 2nd respondent, constituted a concluded contract. The trial court held that internal approval was not in place at the material time (see para 8 of the judgment of the trial court which was reported in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_648;"><i>MBf Holdings Bhd &amp; Anor v. Deutsche Bank (Malaysia) Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2012] MLRHU 648</LINK>; [2012] 8 CLJ 477). And guided by the dicta in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_3_793;"><i>Sri Kajang Rock Products Sdn Bhd v. Mayban Finance Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1991] 3 MLRH 793</LINK>; [1992] 3 CLJ (Rep) 611, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_754;"><i>Ho Kam Phaw v. Fam Sin Nin</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 754</LINK>; [2000] 2 MLJ 529; [2000] 3 CLJ 1; [2000] 2 AMR 1723 and <i>Total Gas Marketing Ltd v. Arco British Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [1998] 2 Lloyds Rep 209, the trial court held that the SA was "not a contract as both parties had not signed it" (see para 11(b) of the judgment of the trial court).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The Court of Appeal saw it differently (the judgment of the Court of Appeal was not reported). According to the Court of Appeal, the issues were (i) whether a separate agreement as envisaged in cl 7 of the mandate letter had come into being in the form of the SA, and if so then, whether the SA was a concluded contract, (ii) whether it was open to Deutsche to rely on 'the causes' in cl 7 of the mandate letter to refuse to sign the SA by reason of the absence of the internal credit approval, and, (iii) whether the request by Deutsche for an amendment to the SA meant that the SA was not a concluded contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the aforesaid issue (i), the Court of Appeal purportedly applied the principles stated in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_188;"><i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 188</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 327; [1997] 1 CLJ 625; [1996] 3 AMR 3533, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_603;"><i>Lee Chin Kok v. Jasmin Arunthuthu Allegakoen &amp; Ors</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 603</LINK>; [2000] 4 MLJ 481; [2000] 4 CLJ 305; [2000] 4 AMR 4635, and <i>OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v. Wong Hua Choo</i> [2012] SGCA 54, and held that an enforceable SA came into existence on 2 November 2007 by reason of the following factors; the SA was the separate agreement envisaged in cl 7 of the mandate letter; two drafts of the SA prepared primarily by Deutsche's solicitors had been forwarded to MBf for approval; after those two drafts had been approved by MBf, Deutsche's solicitors forwarded a third draft of the SA via the following email dated 2 November 2007 at 6.58pm:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Court of Appeal read the aforesaid email dated 2 November 2007 to mean that there was consensus on all the terms and conditions in the SA:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As for the 'variations' sought by Deutsche, the Court of Appeal held that the aforesaid email was "consistent with [Deutsche] acknowledging the subscription agreement to be a concluded contract and for the variation to be accommodated by way of a letter of variation", which finding of a concluded contract and a letter of variation (LV) to accommodate the variations, was further supported, according to the Court of Appeal, by the following email dated 6 November 2007, that was transmitted by Deutsche's solicitors at 21:31 to MBf:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The contents of the aforesaid email dated 6 November 2007 was the subject of intense cross-examination of Yong Pui Wei (DW3) who was hounded to agree that the appellant was ready to execute the SA:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The Court of Appeal held that the aforesaid answers of DW3 further supported the finding that "[Deutsche] treated the SA as a concluded contract":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Two further grounds given by the Court of Appeal to support its finding that the SA was a concluded agreement were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On the aforesaid issue (ii), the Court of Appeal categorised the defence as "not different from that of a party who denies a concluded contract due to the contract being 'subject to contract' and no contract having been signed" and held that "the negotiations in relation to the subscription agreement and the entering into of the subscription agreement fall outside the scope of the mandate letter". The Court of Appeal further reasoned as follows. Given the opening words of cl 7 of the mandate letter - "Client hereby acknowledges that were Deutsche Bank to underwrite the Notes or provide financing to client or any other person or entity" - "[Deutsche] was under no obligation to underwrite the Notes or provide finance under the mandate letter". Since there was no obligation on the part of Deutsche to underwrite the Notes, "the various conditions including those in cl 7(g) which fall under the term 'hereunder' are not applicable to the subscription agreement". "In our judgment, once [Deutsche] resolved to enter into the transaction to provide finance by way of the subscription agreement, the legal rights of the parties are governed by the subscription agreement ... once it is accepted that the subscription agreement is the separate agreement ... it follows that [Deutsche] cannot rely on the conditions or 'causes' in cl 7 as a basis to refuse to sign the subscription agreement or to deny the existence of a concluded contract." "... we agree ... that upon [Deutsche] appointing solicitors to finalise the terms and conditions of the separate agreement pursuant to [Deutsche]'s decision to provide financing, the rights of the parties ought to be determined in law based on the terms and conditions of the separate agreement and not the 'causes' in the mandate letter." "... it was open to [Deutsche] to incorporate conditions similar to the 'causes' in cl 7 of the mandate letter if its intention was to reserve the rights to 'walk away' from the subscription agreement in the form of conditions precedent and or conditions subsequent." "... once the subscription agreement had become an enforceable contract, as is our finding on the facts of this case, it was no longer open to [Deutsche] to refuse to sign the subscription agreement." "... the fact that [Deutsche] had not signed the subscription agreement is not relevant since if the agreement was a concluded contract, then [Deutsche] was obliged to sign the same, if need be by an order of specific performance." "... by appointing lawyers to complete the legal documentation and by authorising them to allow the [1st respondent] to sign the fair copy of the subscription agreement without making known any impediment on their part to the completion of the agreement", Deutsche was "clearly estopped in law from contending that there was no internal approval to complete the transaction" (see paras 20-22 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> And in relation to the aforesaid issue (iii), which the Court of Appeal, really, could only answer in tandem with its answer to the aforesaid issue (i), the Court of Appeal held that the variations sought by Deutsche "did not affect the status of the subscription agreement as a concluded contract for the following reasons". The Court of Appeal also said the following; by its email dated 6 November 2007 at 8.37am, Deutsche did not seriously object to the amendment. Further, to the receipt of MBf's comments on the LV by solicitors for Deutsche at 2.30pm, it was not communicated to MBf that the same was not acceptable to Deutsche. On 6 November 2007 at 9.31pm, by an internal email, Deutsche's solicitors indicated that they understood from Raja Ali that Deutsche proposed to sign the SA and LV "earliest this Wednesday and latest this Friday". "Since that email [at 9.31pm] was subsequent to the email from MBf to Deutsche, it was reasonable to conclude that Raja Ali was prepared to accommodate the comments of MBf on the amendment." "... in any event, the subscription agreement in cl 15 provided for the contingency of amendment made to the subscription agreement. The amendments were to be evidenced <i>inter alia</i> by an exchange of letters."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The Court of Appeal concluded that the "trial court failed to consider whether [MBf] had led sufficient evidence that the subscription agreement was a concluded contract ... and failed to appreciate that [Deutsche] failed to establish their defence that they had notified [MBf] of the need for and the absence of internal approval during the negotiations leading to the subscription agreement". "In our judgment, once the 'causes' in cl 7 of the mandate letter are excluded for the reasons contained in this judgment, it is apparent that there is overwhelming documentary evidence that the subscription agreement is a concluded contract based on the objective facts and regard being had to all the circumstance of this case."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On those reasons, the intermediate appeal was allowed, and MBf's claim was remitted to the Registrar of the trial court for assessment of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Before us, the learned counsel for Deutsche submitted; it was made clear at the onset that internal credit approval had to be obtained before Deutsche could be bound to any funding arrangement; Deutsche did not sign the SA by reason of the absence of the internal credit approval; the mandate letter was the only document signed by all parties; by a letter dated 12 November 2007, Deutsche informed MBf that the internal credit approval had been refused; between 12 November 2007 to 28 November 2007, the parties exchanged emails on the alternatives proposed by Deutsche; on 26 November 2007, MBf gave notice that it considered the SA as a concluded contract; the tender of the initial subscription fee on 27 November 2007 was an afterthought, as MBf knew that the internal credit approval had been refused; the thrust of MBf's case at the trial court was the alleged oral representation of one Raja Ali that the internal credit approval was in place and MBf had executed the SA in reliance thereof; at the trial court, the case of MBf proceeded with recognition that the internal credit approval was a prerequisite for the execution of the subscription agreement; at the Court of Appeal, MBf's case was focused on the emails to establish a concluded contract; the Court of Appeal applied the conventional principles of contract formation, and the principle of an informal binding contract to bind Deutsche; the Court of Appeal attached little importance to the internal credit requirement; the principle of an informal contract was not appropriate to bind a multi-million funding contract; the emails evinced that the question of internal credit approval was always at the forefront; the Court of Appeal was wrong to hold that the internal credit approval was only a term of the mandate letter that lapsed when the SA came into being; under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_372;;">Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989</LINK>, no banking financing on a commercial scale could take place without internal credit approval; the Court of Appeal was wrong to rely on <i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i> and <i>Lee Chin Kok v. Jasmin Arunthuthu Allegakoen &amp; Ors</i>, from only the three aspects of parties, property and price; in <i>New Zealand Shipping Co v. Satterwaite</i> [1975] AC 154, Lord Wilberforce pointed to a whole series of contract situations that do not fit the traditional mould of contract formation; as was observed by Lord Greene in <i>Clifton v. Palumbo</i> [1944] 2 All ER 497, that in the case of a large transaction, no one would dispense with a purchase contract; recently, in <i>Cheverny Consulting Ltd v. Whitehead Mann Ltd</i> [2007] 1 All ER (Comm) 124, the English Court of Appeal observed in general that "the more complicated the matter the more likely the parties were to want to enshrine their contract in some document ..." and endorsed the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <i>Concorde Enterprises Ltd v. Anthony Motors (Hutt) Ltd</i> [1981] 2 NZLR 385, where Cooke J spoke of the normal inference that in transactions of some complexity, parties would not consider themselves bound until a formal agreement is drawn up and executed by both sides; in <i>Birse Construction Ltd v. St David Ltd No (2)</i> [2000] 78 Const LR 121, the specialist construction court held that even if it could be said that all essential terms were agreed, it is still necessary to consider whether the parties intended to be contractually bound when the putative agreement had been scrutinised or when documents had been duly signed; in <i>GYC Financial Planning Pte Ltd and Another v. Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (Pte) Ltd</i> [2006] 2 SLR 865, Judith Prakash J declined to uphold the existence of an oral contract in the case of a complex agency that required compliance with a governing statute; the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_372;;">BAFIA 1989</LINK> must be complied before funding of the receivables of the 2nd respondent could be put in place; Deutsche could not have agreed to emails to form a binding agreement; Deutsche formally rejected the funding proposal on 12 November 2007; the proposal was being considered by the Risk Exposure Committee in Kuala Lumpur which awaited approval from the Credit Risk Management in Singapore/London; internal credit control and approval is a legal requirement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_372;65.;;">ss 65</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_372;67.;;">67 of BAFIA 1989</LINK>; Bank Negara Malaysia guidelines have the force of law; courts recognised that banks may rightfully act on internal guidelines (<i>Barclays Bank Plc v. O'Brien</i> [1994] 1 AC 180 and <i>Cornish v. Midland Bank</i> [1985] 3 All ER 513 were cited); it was not open to Raja Ali to dispense with a legal requirement (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_514;"><i>Chase Perdana Bhd v. Md Afendi Hamdan</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 514</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 783; [2009] 6 CLJ 501 was cited); the requirement for internal credit approval, which was stated in the mandate letter, was surprisingly discounted by the Court of Appeal; the mandate letter was the prelude to the SA which could not come into being without satisfaction of the conditions in the mandate letter; the email exchanges showed that both sides realised the need for the internal credit approval; and, the Court of Appeal failed to realise that the amendments were significant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned counsel for MBf responded: the Court of Appeal correctly identified the three issues; the Court of Appeal followed well-established principles laid down in <i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i>, <i>Lee Chin Kok v. Jasmin Arunthuthu Allegakoen &amp; Ors</i>, and <i>OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v. Wong Hua Choo</i> to find a concluded contract; all terms and conditions were agreed when the third draft of the SA, which had been approved by MBf, together with an email on 2 November 2007 at 6.58pm seeking confirmation as to whether parties had further comments, were forwarded to MBf; the Court of Appeal was absolutely right to find that Deutsche could not rely on cl 7 of the mandate letter to justify refusal to sign the subscription agreement or deny the existence of a concluded contract; the internal credit approval was an excuse to get out of a binding contract; the contingency of amendments was provided for in the subscription agreement; the extant documents pointed to a concluded contract; <i>locus poenitentiae</i> and specific performance were never raised in the courts below; leave questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 were not issues pleaded and/or put before the Court of Appeal; the essential question at the trial was whether there was a concluded contract; grave injustice would be occasioned if Deutsche were allowed to raise new issues at the apex court (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_471;"><i>Pacific Forest Industries Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Lin Wen-Chih &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 471</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 293; [2009] 6 CLJ 430, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_408;"><i>Veronica Lee Ha Ling &amp; Ors v. Maxisegar Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 408</LINK>; [2011] 2 MLJ 141; [2009] 6 CLJ 232 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_5_437;"><i>Datuk M Kayveas &amp; Anor v. Bar Council</i> [2013] 5 MLRA 437</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 640; [2013] 7 CLJ 533; [2013] 4 AMR 802 were cited); it is settled that to find that a contract has been concluded, the court must find that the parties are at <i>ad idem</i>; there is no different rule for a complex contract; leave questions 3 and 6 suggest that funding transactions are subject to the internal credit approvals, which could not be right; how are customers of banks to know the requirements; in the absence of circumstances to the contrary, customers are entitled to assume that the internal credit approvals must have been complied with; <i>locus poenitentiae</i> has no relevance; pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;18.;;">s 18 of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK>, damages could be awarded <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance; pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;74.;;">s 74 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, compensation could be awarded for loss or damage caused by breach of contract; a pursuer has a right to elect the remedy (<i>Johnson v. Agnew</i> [1979] 2 WLR 489 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_420;"><i>Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat &amp; Anor v. Plenitude Holdings Sdn Bhd</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 420</LINK>; [1994] 3 MLJ 777; [1995] 1 CLJ 15; [1995] 1 AMR 041 were cited); MBf was entitled to abandon the relief for specific performance; and, in the face of the refusal of the trial court to review the evidence that pertained to the issue of damages, the Court of Appeal was entitled to direct a rehearing of the assessment of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The SA, which was executed by one but not the other, might have been a complex and intricate agreement. But yet this appeal only involves a question of basic contract law. One issue is whether or not the parties were at <i>ad idem</i>, which Lord Diplock explained in <i>Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v. Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal</i> [1983] 1 AC 854 at pp 915-916, in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> But consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms alone is not enough to form a binding contract. "... in order for a promise to be legally enforceable as a contract, it must be intended to be legally binding, or, as it is more often put, the parties must intended to enter into legal relations ... the earliest judicial support for such a requirement in case law is in the judgment of Atkin LJ in Balfour v. Balfour ... " (Butterworths Common Law Series, <i>The Law of Contract</i>, 3rd edn at para 2.169). "The requirement of an intention to create legal relations, additional to the test of bargain, has been repeatedly critised by academic commentators" (see <i>BA Hepple</i> [1970] 28(1) CLJ 122 at 127; see also <i>AWB Simpson</i> [1975] 91 LQR 247 at 263 - 265). But "since the later nineteenth century, it has become common to say that in addition to the existence of an agreement (generally established through offer and acceptance) and consideration, the formation of an informal contract requires evidence of an 'intention to create legal relations' - that is, there is a substantive additional requirement that the parties intended their agreement to have legally binding force ... Each party agrees not only to the terms of the contract but agrees to it being a contract" (<i>Formation and Variation of Contracts</i> by John Cartwright at p 55). When parties enter into it, there must be an intention to create legal relations (see <i>RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v. Molkerei Alois Muller GmbH &amp; Co KG</i> [2010] UKSC 14, see also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_6_569;"><i>Hui Jia Hao v.

Hallwood Estates Ltd</i> [1960] 1 WLR 549, at 558; see also <i>Sutton and Shannon on Contracts</i> 6th edn at p 54).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> "But where a claim is based on a proved or admitted express agreement, the courts do not require, in addition, proof that parties to an ordinary commercial relationship actually intended to be bound" (Treitel's, <i>The Law of Contract</i> 13th edn at para 4-026). "In the case of agreements regulating business relations it follows almost as a matter of course that the parties intend legal consequences to follow" (<i>Sutton and Shannon on Contracts (supra)</i>, at 55). "... each party [in commercial contracts] will normally be entitled to assume that a legally-binding agreement had been formed, and so the courts will normally accept that there is a contract as long as the agreement, supported by consideration, is established; they do not require affirmative proof of the parties' intention and indeed, they will presume the intention unless there is proof of no such intention ... one way in which parties may indicate expressly that they do not intend to be legally bound is by expressing pre-contractual negotiations to be 'subject to contract'. But even when the negotiations between commercial parties are complete, they may include in their agreement a provision making clear that it creates no legal commitment" (<i>Formation and Variation of Contracts</i> by John Cartwright at pp 57-58). "It is perfectly possible for the parties to an apparent contract to provide that there shall be <i>locus poenitentiae</i> until the terms of their agreement have been reduced to a formal contract ..." (<i>Stobo Ltd v. Morrisons (Gowns) Ltd</i> [1949] SC 184 at 192 per Lord President Cooper). "... the contract would be concluded when there is agreement formed by the unequivocal acceptance of an offer; and in the case of a written contract there will typically be such an agreement before the final written text is signed by the parties. In order, therefore to ensure that no prematurely binding contract is concluded through the exchanges, whether oral or written, by which the parties come to their agreement, it should be made clear that the parties will not be bound until they have signed a written document which will itself form the contract. The simplest way to achieve this is to make the negotiations expressly subject to contract" (<i>Formation and Variation of Contracts</i> by John Cartwright at pp 107-108). "These words negative contractual intention, so that parties are not normally bound until formal contracts are exchanged" (<i>Chitty on Contracts</i> 30th edn vol 1 at para 2-161, see also paras 2-116-2-120). "This terminology was traditionally confined to negotiations for the sale of land, but is now more widely used in commercial transactions" (<i>The Construction Contracts: Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification</i> by Gerard McMeel 2nd edn at para 14.14).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Unless required by law, the formality of an executed contract is an exception rather than a rule. "The general rule is that contracts can be made informally" (<i>The Law of Contract (supra)</i>, at para 5-003), "unless it belongs to some class in which a particular form is specially required" (<i>The Principles of Contract</i> by Frederick Pollock, 11th edn at p 118). Where formality is by choice, "it provides a mechanism for a transaction which the parties will follow if they wish their transaction to have certain effects, although they could carry out the transaction without the formality" (<i>Formation and Variation of Contracts</i> by John Cartwright at p 129).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> If formality of an executed contract is by choice, it should be made clear that parties are not bound until execution of the formal contract. In <i>Rossiter v. Miller</i> [1878] 3 App Cas 1124, W was authorised to sell a piece of land divided into lots. Certain conditions, on which the land might be let or sold, were printed on the plan of the lots. M made inquiries of W as to the sale of certain lots. W expressly informed M that he must purchase subject to the conditions stated on the plan. One of these conditions required that a purchaser should execute a contract embodying the conditions. M offered to purchase these lots at a price which he named. W later informed M that the proprietors had accepted his offer; adding, that in reducing the price, they had taken into consideration his intention of soon building on the land. W added that he had instructed solicitors to forward to M the agreement for purchase. There was, in fact, nothing in the conditions which bound a purchaser to build, though there were provisions which assumed that he might do so. M wrote back that he could not be bound to build at any given time, or at all, and that the subject had better be reconsidered, unless W was prepared to leave him to do as he might think best. W replied that the acceptance of the offer was without condition, and that M was free to do what he might think best. M afterwards declined to complete the purchase. The House of Lords held that what had taken place by the correspondence constituted a complete contract between the parties; that under such circumstances the execution of a formal deed was not necessary; that the reference to it in W's letter did not suspend or in any way affect the contract; and that M was bound specifically to perform his contract of purchase.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Lord Cairns LC drew the distinction between an unqualified acceptance and an acceptance subject to the condition that an agreement is to be prepared and agreed upon between parties:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Lord Hatherley agreed that an oral agreement stands, unless the terms of the agreement itself provide that it should be concluded by a formal contact:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> And Lord Blackburn imparted that parties ought not to be bound until the execution of a formal agreement, if that appears to be the intention, which is a question of construction of the evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> "Whether the parties have agreed to exclude the possibility of legal enforceability depends on the proper construction of the words used. If they clearly express an intention not to be legally bound the court will give effect to their intention" (<i>The Law of Contract (Butterworths Common Law Series)</i>, 3rd edn, para 2.179). "The test of an intention to effect legal relations is an objective one" (<i>Anson's Law of Contract</i> 28th edn at p 71). "... the court adopts an objective approach, having regard to what the parties said and did in the course of negotiations ... It ask what would reasonable and honest men in the position of the parties and having their shared knowledge of the surrounding circumstances have under stood by the communication passed between them" (<i>Baillie Estates Ltd v. Du Pont (UK) Ltd</i> [2009] CSOH 95, per Lord Hodge).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> But it should be added that it does not necessarily follow that 'subject to contract' intractably means that parties remain in negotiations. For cases are not the same, when parties that have been in negotiations reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and agree that the matter of their negotiations shall be dealt with by a formal contract. That was underscored in the following two authorities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In <i>Love and Stewart Ltd v. S Instone and Co Ltd</i> [1917] Times Law Reports Vol XXXIII 475 at p 476, Lord Loreburn enunciated:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The different cases of "subject to contract" were more clearly detailed in <i>Masters v. Cameron</i> [1954] 91 CLR 353, which established key principles to determine whether or not an intention to be legally bound exists in pre-contract agreements, where the facts were as follows. C agreed, by a memorandum of 6 December 1951, to sell a certain pastoral property to M. The final sentence of the memorandum provided "This agreement is made subject to the preparation of a formal contract of sale which shall be acceptable to my solicitors on the above terms and conditions, and to the giving of possession on or about the Fifteenth Day of March 1952". The trial court decided that a binding contract was concluded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On appeal, the first question was whether the memorandum constituted a binding contract. Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ, observed that all the essentials of a contract - the parties were agreed that there should be a sale and purchase, and the parties, the property, the price, and the date for possession were all clearly settled - were there, "but whether there is a contract depends upon the meaning and effect of the final sentence of the memorandum:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ held that there is a binding contract in each of the first two cases:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> On the third case, Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ held that the terms of agreement are not intended to have, and therefore do not have, any binding effect of their own:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> As to whether there is a special form of words to be used in order that there shall be no binding contract before the execution of the agreement, Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ set out the purport of "subject to contract" and propounded that so long as the intention is disclosed by the language employed by the parties, there is no special form:</p>

      <b>[35]</b> Valuable guidance was also imparted in <i>Pagnan SpA v.

Molkerei Alois Miller GmbH &amp; Co KG</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Local authorities had not distinguished the different cases of "subject to contract". Some earlier authorities equated the expression "subject to contract" to a term or condition of the bargain (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1962_1_479;"><i>Koh Peng Moh v. Tan Chwee Boon</i> [1962] 1 MLRH 479</LINK>; [1962] 1 MLJ 353, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1973_1_762;"><i>Tai Tong Realty Co (Pte) Ltd v.

    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> But by and large, the preponderance of local authorities, right down to the present, constructed the expression "subject to contract" from the intention of the parties. The move away from equating the expression "subject to contract" as a term or condition of the bargain to the giving of effect to the intention of the parties probably started in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1963_1_377;"><i>Low Kar Yit &amp; Ors v.

That offer was accepted, but the appellants refused to complete the agreement. The respondent applied for specific performance. The respondent averred that there was a concluded contract. In their defence, the appellants pleaded that the sale was subject to contract. Wan Yahya J, as he then was, ordered specific performance. On appeal, it was held by Abdul Hamid FJ, as he then was, delivering the judgment of the court, that on the evidence and exhibits it was the intention of the parties to come to a definite and complete agreement on the sale and the mere fact that a written agreement had to be drawn up and executed by them did not necessarily mean that there was no legally binding and enforceable agreement:</p>

On appeal, it was held by Peh Swee Chin SCJ, later FCJ, delivering the judgment of the court, that there need not be the very words "subject to contract" to have the effect arising from such formula, but that the formula "subject to contract" gives rise to a strong presumption of the necessity of a further formal contract, which presumption could only be displaced by cogent evidence:</p>

YC Chin Enterprises Sdn Bhd</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 201</LINK>; [1994] 2 MLJ 754; [1994] 3 CLJ 133; [1994] 2 AMR 1631, had to deliberate on another "subject to contract" agreement. YC Chin had entered into negotiations to construct low-cost houses and shophouses for Ayer Hitam Tin Dredging ('AHTD'). By letter, AHTD accepted YC Chin's proposals, subject to certain terms and conditions, one of which was that the terms and conditions in the letter were to be constituted in an agreement between YC Chin and AHTD and that appropriate indemnity clauses in favour of AHTD were to be incorporated in the agreement. In reliance upon the letter, YC Chin proceeded to perform some of their obligations stated therein, although no formal agreement in writing had been executed. Subsequently, AHTD instructed YC Chin to cease all work, stating their intention to discontinue negotiations and that any work done had been entirely at YC Chin's risk. AHTD contended that the work had been done before the coming into being of any contract and that the letter was part of ongoing negotiations for a future agreement. YC Chin submitted that all essential terms had been agreed and all that remained to be done was to put the terms into the form of a contract. The trial judge found that there was a contract and allowed YC Chin's claim for breach. On appeal, the Supreme Court per Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ, later FCJ, delivering the judgment of the court, held and observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In <i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i>, the appellant/vendor contended that the agreement to sell was subject to contract, on account of the phrase 'subject to the sale and purchase agreement' appearing in the first letter, and that the terms had not been agreed upon. The issues before the court were: (i) whether there was a valid and enforceable agreement between the vendor and the purchaser; and (ii) if the answer was in the affirmative, whether that agreement had been frustrated by the grant of the injunction in question. It was held by the Federal Court per Gopal Sri Ram JCA, as he then was, delivering the judgment of the court, "that the phrase 'subject to the sale and purchase agreement' relied on by counsel for the appellant does not, in our judgment, point to an intention that no contract was to come into existence until a formal sale and purchase agreement had been prepared and executed. Rather, it is, when read in the context of the correspondence and the objective aim of the transaction - and this is how we read them - indicative of an intention to merely formalise the agreement already concluded between the parties".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In <i>Lee Chin Kok v. Jasmin Arunthuthu Allegakoen &amp; Ors</i>, the respondents put up properties for sale through an estate agent who wrote a letter marked 'Without prejudice and subject to contract' to the appellant confirming the appellant's interest in purchasing the property at RM215,000. The letter contained other terms and conditions. The respondent wrote a letter to the estate agent changing the conditions as stated in the agent's earlier letter to the appellant. The properties were subsequently sold to a competing purchaser. The appellant's claim against the respondent was dismissed by the High Court. On appeal, it was held by the Federal Court per Abdul Malek Ahmad FCJ, as he then was, delivering the judgment of the court, that each case must turn on its own facts, and that on the facts, there was no concluded contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_781;"><i>Sinar Wang Sdn Bhd v. Ng Kee Seng</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 781</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 42; [2004] 3 CLJ 679; [2004] 5 AMR 648, where the pro forma of sale of a property used the phrase 'subject to contract', it was held by the Court of Appeal per Gopal Sri Ram JCA, as he then was, delivering the judgment of the court, that "It does not follow as night follows day that just because the words 'subject to contract' appear in a pro forma, that there is no concluded contract. This proposition is well illustrated by the decision of the former Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_97;"><i>Lim Keng Siong &amp; Anor v. Yeo Ah Tee</i> [1983] 1 MLRA 97</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 39; [1983] CLJ (Rep) 231".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Hence, it is the intention of the parties, as construed from the evidence, and not the expression "subject to contract", which determines whether parties are in negotiations. "Where there is an informal agreement which expressly requires or envisages the subsequent execution of a formal contract, the legal effect of that prior informal agreement at common law depends on the intention of the parties" (<i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> 5th edn vol 22 at p 270). Perhaps, there is no better example of parties still in negotiations than <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_204;"><i>Kheamhuat Holdings Sdn Bhd v. The Indian Association Penang</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 204</LINK>; [2006] 4 MLJ 656; [2006] 2 CLJ 1040; [2000] 4 AMR 3983, where the memorandum of understanding provided that the MOU was subject to the consent of the General Body to the proposal, the consent of the High Court, and a final agreement being concluded between the parties after their lawyers have studied and advised on the matter, which said provisions were construed by the Court of Appeal per Mokhtar Sidin JCA, delivering judgment of the court, to mean that the parties were still negotiating and did not intend to be bound until a formal contract is exchanged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> To sum up, without consensus <i>ad idem</i>, there is no concluded contract. But consensus <i>ad idem</i> on just the terms is not enough to form a concluded contract. In addition, there must be the intention to create legal relations and consideration. In most commercial agreements, the court will presume that intention (see <i>Contract Law, An Introduction to the English Law of Contract for the Civil Lawyer</i> by John Cartwright at p 140), unless there is proof of no such intention. Formality is the exception and not the rule. It does not follow that just because of the expression "subject to contract" there is no concluded contract. But if formality is by choice, it should be made clear that parties are not bound until the execution of a formal agreement. "... if the intention were that what was agreed in the first instance should be the subject to the completion of the formal document, then there was no bargain while that condition remain unfulfilled. Also, of course, there was no agreement if the parties had not agreed on a set of terms at all, either absolutely or conditionally" (<i>Love and Stewart Ltd v. S Instone and Co Ltd</i> [1917] per Lord Loreburn).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> But alas, both courts below, with respect, had approached the core issue - whether or not there was a concluded agreement on 2 November 2007 - from only the aspect of consensus <i>ad idem</i>. There was no deliberation of the intention to create legal relations. To be fair, the trial court needed not, since it was its finding that there was no consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms, to deliberate on the intention to create legal relations. But there was no reason for the Court of Appeal not to proceed to deliberate on the intention to create legal relations, since it was its finding that there was consensus ad idem on the terms. "The intention to be bound is a jural act separate and distinct from the terms of the bargain" (<i>Air Great Lakes Pty Ltd v. KS Easter (Holdings) Pte Ltd</i> [1985] 2 NSWLR 309 per McHugh JA). To conclude that there was a concluded contract, merely on account of a finding of consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms, was a serious misdirection by the Court of Appeal. As said, the presumption of intention to create legal relations could be negatived. Clause 7 of the mandate letter provided that there should be a separate agreement, if Deutsche were to underwrite the Notes or provide financing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> If Deutsche were to provide financing, the mandate letter could not be the agreement. There must be a separate agreement. If Deutsche were to provide financing, the SA would be that separate agreement as envisaged in the mandate letter. But even though the SA was that separate agreement as envisaged in the mandate letter, yet it did not follow that there was a binding contract. For there were conditions to be fulfilled before a separate agreement could bind the parties. Quite apart from the internal credit approval, it was also a condition that a separate agreement must be "completed and executed" before the parties were legally bound. Was that duly completed and executed separate agreement not a formality by choice? Was it not made clear that parties were not bound until execution of the formal contract which would itself form the contract? Was that not amply clear in the mandate letter? In the opening paragraph of the mandate letter, Deutsche accepted its appointment as Lead Arranger and Lead Manager to provide advisory services for financing secured on a portfolio of credit card receivables of the 2nd respondent. Clause 1 set out the advisory services to be provided. Clause 2, a lock-out clause, provided that Deutsche was the only party engaged to provide the said advisory services. Clauses 3 &amp; 4 stipulated the fees and expenses payable to Deutsche for the said advisory services. Clauses 5 &amp; 6 provided for the early termination and or expiry of Deutsche's appointment as Lead Arranger and Lead Manager. Clause 7 provided "that were Deutsche Bank to underwrite the Notes or provide financing to client or any other person or entity, the terms and conditions of such transactions would be subject to separate agreements between client, Deutsche Bank and/or such other person or entity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as an obligation on the part of Deutsche Bank or any member of the Deutsche Bank Group to enter into any swap transaction with or to provide any financing to client or any other person or entity or to underwrite the Notes. Deutsche Bank's obligations hereunder, are expressly subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The mandate letter must be read as a whole. And when read as a whole, but which the Court of Appeal failed, with respect, to do, it is unmistakable that the mandate letter was a composite of bargains. It was a bargain on the said advisory services. And it was also a bargain for the formation of a binding contract, that is, if Deutsche were to finance and if the conditions in cl 7 had been fulfilled. The purport of the mandate letter was very clear. While Deutsche was the Lead Arranger and Lead Manager, it had the option to underwrite the Notes or provide financing. And if Deutsche so opted to underwrite the Notes or provide financing, cl 7 provided "that the terms and conditions of such transactions would be subject to a separate agreement". Clause 7 further provided that nothing in the mandate letter "shall be construed as an obligation on the part of Deutsche Bank or any member of the Deutsche Bank Group to enter into any swap transaction with or to provide any financing to client or any other person or entity or to underwrite the Notes". It is so clear and unambiguous that the mandate letter could not give rise to any obligation on the part of Deutsche to provide financing. For that commitment by Deutsche, there must be a separate agreement which itself was subject to the satisfaction of eight conditions. Of the pertinent conditions, condition (g) required internal credit approval to have been obtained by Deutsche, and condition (h) required "the completion and execution of mutually satisfactory documentation, and the satisfaction of conditions contained therein".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Clause 7 provided that all eight conditions must be fulfilled before any separate agreement could bind Deutsche. So even if the internal credit approval had been obtained, which was disputed by Deutsche who should know best as to whether it had or had not been obtained, there was yet condition (h) that remained unfulfilled. Given that the manner in which the parties had proposed to enter into a binding contract was provided by cl 7 (see <i>Carruthers v. Whitaker &amp; Anor</i> [1975] 2 NZLR 667, where it was held by the New Zealand Court of Appeal that the manner in which a contract is to become binding must be gathered from the intentions of the parties express or implied), it is so clear from the mandate letter, from a plain and natural reading of it, that the parties plainly contemplated the execution of a separate agreement as a prerequisite to the conclusion of a binding contract. And in relation to that latter intention, there is nothing in any of the correspondence or emails to suggest that Deutsche had waived the formality of an executed agreement (see <i>Cohen v. Nessdale</i> [1982] 2 All ER 97, where it was held by the English Court of Appeal that a 'subject to contract' qualification, once introduced into negotiations, could only cease to apply to the negotiations if the parties expressly or by necessary implication agreed that it should be expunged; see also Contract Law: An Introduction to the English Law of Contract for the Civil Lawyer (supra), by John Cartwright at p 70; see also <i>Whittle Movers Ltd v. Hollywood Express Ltd</i> [2009] EWCA Civ 1189, where it was held by Waller LJ Waller (Dyson and Lloyd LJJ agreeing), that the finding of the trial judge, that there was no complete agreement on the terms and that neither had resiled from "subject to contract", was unassailable; see however <i>Haq v. Island Homes Housing Association &amp; Anor</i> [2011] EWCA Civ 805, where it was held Lloyd LJ (Arden and Tomlinson LJJ agreeing) "that it is not open to one party alone to convert their status from being subject to contract ... it has to be bilateral and not unilateral"; see also <i>Oceanografia SA de CV v. DSND Subsea AS (The "Botnica")</i> [2006] EWHC 1360 (Comm) at paras 89-91).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Like Kam Mah Theatre v. Tan Lay Soon and <i>Kheamhuat Holdings Sdn Bhd v. The Indian Association Penang</i>, where there were conditions to be first fulfilled, cl 7 had set out the agreed conditions for the formation of a binding contract. And by reason of the nonfulfilment of the condition (h) of cl 7, no separate agreement could come into being as a binding contract. Clause 7 was the bridge from the mandate letter to a separate agreement. Clause 7 was an integral and inseparable part of the mandate letter. That it could be ignored by the Court of Appeal who held that it was inapplicable, was, with respect, against all canons of construction. The Court of Appeal held that cl 7 should be incorporated in the separate agreement. But with respect, cl 7 was the bargain for the formation of a binding contract. Clause 7 was only pertinent and alive when parties were in negotiations. But if the separate agreement had come into being as a binding contract, there was no reason to incorporate cl 7 which had served its purpose (see <i>Petromec Inc &amp; Ors v. Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobas &amp; Ors</i> [2005] EWCA Civ 891 at paras 78 and 81). Incorporation then, of cl 7, in the subscription agreement would not serve any purpose. But no separate agreement could come into being as a binding contract without the fulfilment of cl 7, which was the litmus test. Yet cl 7 was cast aside, like unwanted baggage. Simply put, we could not, with respect, even faintly support the Court of Appeal's construction of the mandate letter. Against the backdrop of facts/circumstances and pertinent law, we have read and reread the mandate letter as a whole. But each time we tried to read it any differently, we could only construct the mandate letter to mean that the execution of the SA was an agreed term for the formation of a binding contract. The formality of an executed agreement was by clear choice. It was agreed that without Deutsche's execution of a separate agreement, there could be no binding contract to provide financing. Deutsche had not signed the SA. "That alone would show that no binding agreement had been arrived" (<i>Love and Stewart Ltd v. S Instone and Co Ltd</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> There would have been no issue on the terms, had the SA been executed by both sides. But there was no executed agreement. Whether or not the parties had reached consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms on 2 November 2007 could only be gleaned from the mandate letter, the emails/letters and conduct of the parties (see <i>Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v. Ex-Cell-O Corp (England) Ltd</i> [1979] 1 WLR 401, where Lord Denning propounded that the better way to find an agreement "is to look at all the documents passing between the parties, and glean from them or from the conduct of the parties, whether they have reached agreement on all material points ..." and <i>RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v. Molkerei Alois Muller GmbH &amp; Co KG</i> where Lord Clarke stated that "whether there is a binding contract ... depends ... not on the subjective mind, but upon a consideration of what was communicated between them by words or conduct ...") from the perspective of the notional reasonable man (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_201;"><i>Ayer Hitam Tin Dredging Malaysia Bhd v. YC Chin Enterprises Sdn Bhd</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 201</LINK>; [1994] 2 MLJ 754; [1994] 3 CLJ 133; [1994] 2 AMR 1631).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The Court of Appeal picked out isolated bits of the emails to find consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms. Except that the set of emails and correspondence had a different tale. In June 2007, Deutsche gave a presentation on securitisation opportunities to MBf. At about the same time, on 4 June 2007, CIMB Investment Bank Berhad also offered its services to MBf as its sole Principal Adviser/Lead Arranger/Lead Manager etc for the proposed securitisation of MBf's card receivables. MBf had two suitors. What transpired immediately thereafter was not in evidence. But three months later, by an email dated 25 September 2007, Deutsche messaged MBf on "structure, pricing and internal approval", and by an email dated 28 September 2007, Deutsche forwarded a paper on securitisation opportunities to MBf. That was followed by MBf's letter dated 1 October 2007 to Deutsche, which enclosed various documents, and by MBf's memorandum dated 3 October 2007 to Deutsche, which enclosed other information. By an email dated 3 October 2007, Deutsche requested further data from MBf. Just minutes later, by email, Deutsche forwarded a draft mandate letter "for discussion at 2pm" to MBf. That same afternoon, Deutsche forwarded a revised draft mandate letter to MBf. On 8 October 2007, Deutsche and the 1st respondent executed the mandate letter. Internal credit approval was raised in MBf's email dated 16 October 2007 to Deutsche, wherein MBf enquired "did your Credit Committee discuss our proposal yesterday?" On 18 October 2007, Deutsche presented a "Securitisation of Credit Card Receivables, Kick-Off Book" to MBf. Meantime, solicitors were in communication on the draft agreements. On 24 October 2007, Raja Ali of Deutsche enquired from Barry Weisbatt of Deutsche Singapore, on the outcome of the meeting with the Credit Committee. By an email dated 25 October 2007, Deutsche forwarded a revised draft SA, subject to changes, to MBf. Shortly thereafter, Barry Weisbatt instructed Raja Ali to ignore the draft SA, which, allegedly, was full of mistakes. Between 25 October 2007 to 29 October 2007, solicitors were still in negotiations on the terms of the draft agreements. By 31 October 2007, MBf had furnished all required documents to Deutsche (see 1620-1623, 1625, 1627 of the Appeal Record). Deutsche then specified Deutsche's "KYC requirements". On 1 November 2007, Deutsche's solicitors forwarded the 2nd draft SA to MBf's solicitors, with the remark "this draft remains subject to any further comments that DB may have" (1654AR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Against that backdrop, Deutsche, on 2 November 2007 at 11:19, sent the following email, which the Court of Appeal picked out to support its finding on consensus <i>ad idem</i>, to its solicitors:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Probably so galvanised, solicitors/parties then exchanged no less than eight emails (1673-1678, 1680-1682AR) on amendments to the second draft SA. On 2 November 2007 at 18:58, Deutsche's solicitors forwarded a third draft SA to Deutsche and MBf, which was another email picked out by the Court of Appeal to support its finding on consensus reached (see p 20 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal), with the following message (see 1683AR):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> About 15 minutes later, Deutsche's solicitors requested MBf/solicitors "to revert with their written confirmation as to whether we may proceed to finalise the draft".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> By an email at 19:44, Deutsche's solicitors transmitted the following email to MBf's solicitors:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> MBf's solicitors responded, with the following two emails:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> On 2 November 2007 at 20:27, Deutsche's solicitors forwarded a fair copy of the third draft SA to MBf's solicitors:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Meantime, on 2 November 2007 at 20:47, Barry Weisblatt informed Deutsche that "DB is not in a position to sign yet. We do not intend to raise a full NPA, but there are several issues to be resolved before we can sign. I believe that MBf want to sign tonight. I don't mind if they do so long as they realise that there could still be amendments" (see 1739AR). On 2 November 2007 at 21:00, Deutsche instructed its solicitors that "DB is not in a position to sign the Subscription Agreement tonight as we have not obtained all internal approvals necessary for DB to commit to this deal" (1740AR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> MBf contended that by then, on 2 November 2007, the parties had a binding contract. The Court of Appeal agreed that the SA came into being on 2 November 2007, and that whatever variations to the SA would be accommodated by a LV. But those findings of binding contract on 2 November 2007 and variations to be accommodated by a LV were not supported by the concatenation of exchanges between the parties after 2 November 2007, which evinced that both parties visibly appreciated that the internal credit approval was yet outstanding and that consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the essential terms had yet not been reached on 2 November 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The 2nd of November 2007 was a Friday. On the next working day, on 5 November 2007 at 06:07, Deutsche's solicitors forwarded a draft LV, being proposed amendments to the SA to Deutsche for comments. On 5 November 2007 at 22:53, Deutsche forwarded the said draft LV to MBf, with the comment "I have not read this". The next morning, on 6 November 2007 at 07:47, MBf forwarded the said draft LV to its solicitors "for review and discussion". On 6 November 2007 at 08:37 MBf responded to Deutsche:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> In the aforesaid email on 6 November 2007 at 08:37, MBf let the cat out that MBf was aware that there was yet no consensus <i>ad idem</i>. The next message from MBf, on 6 November 2007 at 11:46, to its solicitors was even more telling that MBf clearly knew that Deutsche was yet not committed to the SA.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> On 6 November 2007 at 14:30, MBf's solicitors then forwarded the said LV, which proposed substantive amendments to cls 1.2 and 1.3 of the SA, to Deutsche's solicitors (664-667AR). Significantly, in the second paragraph of the LV, MBf stated "following further discussion with Deutsche Bank on 5 November 2007, we hereby agree that the terms of the Subscription Agreement be amended and revised in the following manner", which was not consistent with the contention that there was consensus <i>ad idem</i> on 2 November 2007. The effect of the finding of the Court of Appeal was that all essential terms had been reached on 2 November 2007, that the SA was a binding contract, and that the LV was some sort of novation agreement, a side show, so to speak. In other words, it was the finding of the Court of Appeal that the SA alone stood as a binding contract, without the letter of variation. But when we scrutinised the proposed amendments, we found that the proposed amendments were substantive amendments to the manner in which Deutsche could subscribe or procure the subscription of commercial papers, which materially changed the manner in which the subscription of the commercial papers would be effected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The proposed amendments, in italics, to cl 1.2 of the SA, gave an option, which was not given by the subscription agreement, to MBf to require the subscription to be effected by private placement or direct purchase:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> And the proposed amendment, in italics, to cl 1.3 of the SA, read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> It would seem that the terms were not settled even on 6 November 2007 at 14:30, apart from the pricing, "3% plus KLIBOR or at 4.5%", the option to MBf to require the subscription of the commercial papers to be effected by private placement or direct purchase was also not agreed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> While the proposed amendments were still up in the air, Deutsche's solicitors, on 6 November 200 at 20:27, informed MBf's solicitors that "we would be required by DB's internal legal to issue our legal opinion in favour of DB advising on the legality, validity and enforceability etc of the subscription agreement and the letter of variation of terms", and requested for further documents from MBf (1808AR). It was then that Deutsche's solicitors, on 6 November 2007 at 21:31, sent the following email, which was another email picked out by the Court of Appeal to support its finding on consensus <i>ad idem</i>, to Deutsche:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> Admittedly, by that internal memo on 6 November 2007 at 21:31, it would appear that Deutsche intended to sign the SA and LV "earliest this Wednesday and latest this Friday". But that was an internal memo. Unlike the finding in <i>Carlyle v. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc</i> [2015] UKSC 13 at paras 12, 13 and 36, there was no assurance by Deutsche that the SA would be signed or commitment by Deutsche to provide financing (see also <i>Moria &amp; Anor v. Bednash</i> [2011] EWHC 839 (Ch) at paras 33-34). Rather, MBf was earlier informed, on 6 November 2007 at 20:26 (1808AR), that Deutsche still required a legal opinion on the "legality, validity and enforceability etc of the Subscription Agreement and the letter of variation of terms", which could only convey to MBf that Deutsche was yet not committed to the SA and LV, for if the SA had come into being on 2 November 2007, then there could be no place, certainly not on 6 November 2007, for a legal opinion on the "legality, validity and enforceability, etc of the Subscription Agreement". That everything was tentative could not have escaped MBf.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> But if MBf had understood it to be that the SA came into being on 2 November 2007, the conduct of MBf did not reflect that. For rather than assert that the SA came into being on 2 November 2007, MBf was wholly compliant to Deutsche's requests for further documents. And rather than assert that nothing was outstanding, MBf meekly enquired, on 7 November 2007 at 18:29, "So I presume no news yet from London. Call me please when you receive something" (1834AR), which pointed to MBf's knowledge that the internal credit approval was not in place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> MBf's understanding that the SA had not come into being was further divulged by the conduct of MBf after 12 November 2007 (see <i>R &amp; J Dempster Ltd v. Motherwell Bridge &amp; Engineering Co Ltd</i> [1964] SC 308, and <i>Immingham Storage Company Ltd v. Clear Plc</i> [2011] EWCA Civ 89, where the courts took into account the parties' actions after the alleged moment of contract formation; see also <i>Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v. Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd</i> [2002] 2 NZLR 433 at para 56). On 12 November 2007, Deutsche informed MBf that the conditions for approval of the SA could not be met, and that Deutsche, would revert, effectively, to the role of Lead Arranger and Lead Manager and not financier (1839-1840AR). Deutsche proposed three options to MBf, including the option "to identify investors to back-stop DB's exposure". Evidently, quite spontaneously, between 15 November 2007 to 19 November 2007, MBf went along with the option to search for investors (1841-1848AR), which conduct was at odds with the contention that the SA came into being on 2 November 2007 but was consistent with the fact that the parties accepted that the SA had not been concluded. It was only much later that MBf contended, on 26 November 2007, that the SA came into being on 2 November 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> The entire set of emails/correspondence between the parties consisted of not just the few emails that were picked out by the Court of Appeal. "It can be dangerous to pick out isolated parts of correspondence to find agreement when the whole evidence is that a formal deed was necessary for a binding contract and all else was preliminary ... Parties may have exchanged drafts and have reached consensus but be waiting for a signed agreement before the deal is binding. It is different if the parties do not intend to have a formal document which records their agreement, but rather a formal document which implements an agreement, such as missives to be followed by a formal lease or conveyance" (William W McBride, The Law of Contract of Scotland 3rd edn at para 5-44). Based on the entire set of emails/correspondence, it was so evident that there was no consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms, that condition (g) of cl 7, which was always at the forefront of negotiations, was not satisfied, and that the parties so conducted themselves in sure knowledge that condition (g) of cl 7 had not been fulfilled and that there was no binding contract. And based on cl 7 when read in the context of the mandate letter as a whole, the execution of a separate agreement was a prerequisite for a binding contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Even the testimony of MBf's witnesses lent support to those conclusions. Under cross-examination at 483AR, Thomas Matthew (PW1) agreed that he knew "that internal approval was always an outstanding matter". At 483AR, Thomas also agreed that Deutsche was not obliged to provide financing without a separate agreement. Thomas qualified that answer to mean that a separate agreement was not necessary for the ABS. But that qualification of Thomas contradicted his witness statement and the provisions of the SA. In his witness statement, Thomas affirmed that the SA only covered the subscription of commercial papers issued by MBf (912AR), of up to RM600m in nominal value. The SA was only intended to provide bridge financing, "to provide financing to MBf Cards to repay any CPs that were not taken up or rolled over on maturity" (testimony of Thomas at 905AR), pending the establishment of the ABS. The SA had nothing to do with any asset-based securitisation structure secured on the 2nd respondent's receivables. At no time was it ever at any stage of any ABS. When Thomas referred to "financing" at 483AR, he could only mean "bridge financing", in line with his testimony at 907AR that pending the establishment of the ABS, "Deutsche was to provide bridge finance to the MBf Cards in form of a line of credit ("the Bridge Facility") subject to the satisfaction of conditions set out in cl 7 of the mandate letter pertaining to the Bridge Facility, in particular cl 7(g) and (h) thereof" (907-908AR). There could be no question about it. Thomas, who was in the thick of it from the start and was the star witness for MBf, effectively admitted that the SA required prior satisfaction of conditions (g) and (h) of cl 7 of the mandate letter. In fact, there could be no doubt about it, for Thomas also admitted that whatever financing was subject to the internal credit approval, at 491AR, 493AR, 513AR, 516AR, 517AR, and 518AR, albeit after some disinclination".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> In relation to condition (g), Thomas testified that on 1 November 2007, Raja Ali informed him that the internal approval was in place (912AR). Given that there was no finding by the courts below that the internal credit approval was or was not in place, it required us, therefore, to make that finding, but of course from the entire set of emails/correspondence. As said, the internal credit approval was raised in MBf's email dated 16 October 2007 to Deutsche, wherein MBf enquired "did your Credit Committee discuss our proposal yesterday?" There was no evidence that Deutsche had responded to that enquiry, not even by 2 November 2007, when MBf's request to execute the SA on 2 November 2007 was allowed. Rather, the emails (1739 and 1740AR) showed that Deutsche took the position, which it steadfastly held right up to when MBf allegedly executed the SA on 2 November 2007, that there were issues to be settled and that "Deutsche was not in a position to sign the Subscription Agreement tonight as we have not obtained all internal approvals necessary for DB to commit to this deal". 1739 and 1740AR were internal memos to which MBf were not privy. But nonetheless, it would not appear, not from the email exchanges that MBf was in the dark about the internal credit approval that was not in place on 2 November 2007 and thereafter. On 6 November 2007, Deutsche informed MBf that Deutsch required a legal opinion on the legality, validity and enforceability etc of the SA and LV. In actual fact, MBf was informed that the SA itself was a question mark. As said, it would not seem reasonably conceivable that MBf would just compliantly accept the imposition of a new condition, to wit, a legal opinion on the legality, validity and enforceability etc of the SA and LV, if indeed it were its understanding on 2 November 2007 that the SA came into being on 2 November 2007. But yet, contrary to its contention that the SA came into being on 2 November 2007, MBf furnished all further documents that Deutsche requested on 6 November 2007, which was consistent with the defence that the SA had not come into being on 2 November 2007. In point of fact, when asked "why did [Deutsche by letter dated 7 November 2007] request those documents to be furnished to them?", MBf's solicitor (PW5 - Soo Ching) answered, "normally those documents are required for completion" (946AR), which answer was incompatible with the contention that the SA came into being on 2 November 2207, for there was no reason for Deutsche, certainly not on 7 November 2007, to ask for further documents or for MBf to furnish them, if the SA had come into being as a binding contract on 2 November 2007. Neither would it add up that MBf would still enquire, on 7 November 2007 at 18:29, "So I presume no news yet from London. Call me please when you receive something" (1834AR), if MBf had been informed on 1 November 2007 that the internal credit approval was in place and or if the SA had come into being as a binding contract on 2 November 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> The explanation of Thomas at 602AR was that it was an enquiry "on the drawdown of the facility". But that explanation was highly questionable, as the LV had yet to be settled, which would mean that the full terms had yet to be settled and therefore too premature then to enquire on whatever drawdown. Another reason to doubt the explanation of Thomas was that the email exchanges only borne out that his enquiry on "news from London" could only relate to the decision of Deutsche, whether yes or no, on the SA. On 6 November 2007 at 20:27, Deutsche's solicitors informed MBf's solicitors and Thomas that "we would be required by DB's internal legal to issue our legal opinion in favour of DB advising on the legality, validity and enforceability etc of the subscription agreement and the letter of variation of terms", and asked for further documents (1808AR). As said, on 6 November 2007, MBf was put on notice that "the legality, validity and enforceability etc of the subscription agreement and the letter of variation of terms", which were matters at the heart and soul of internal credit control, were in question, which meant that never was it any one time at any stage of any drawdown of whatever financing. The next morning, on 7 November 2007 at 08:39, Thomas replied and agreed to furnish the documents, which he duly furnished on 7 November 2007. In the interim, on 7 November 2007 at 11:06 Deutsche informed its solicitors that "we have not got all internal approvals to sign these documents. Will let you know when we are ready to sign" (1811AR). In the afternoon, on 7 November 2007 at 14:22, Raja Ali enquired from Barry Weisblatt "on our decision" (1815AR), to which Barry Weisblatt replied "Nothing yet. We'll do our best" (1829AR). That early evening, on 7 November 2007 at 18:05, Raja Ali informed Thomas that "my battery has gone flat" (1829AR). Two minutes later, at 18:07, Thomas messaged Raja Ali, "how do I get in touch with you?" (1831AR). Shortly, on 7 November 2007 at 18:27, Raja Ali replied, "I will watch my blackberry for messages. I will recharge when I am home. On the way to chiropractor now" (1833AR). Two minutes later, on 7 November 2007 at 18:29, Thomas enquired "So I presume no news yet from London. Call me please when you receive something" (1834AR). The enquiry of Thomas on 7 November 2007 at 18:29 was made in that context. All parties had been put on notice that Deutsche required a legal opinion on the legality, etc of the SA and LV, and further documents from MBf, which notice was duly acknowledged by MBf on 7 November 2007 when MBf furnished the further documents. On 7 November 2007, MBf should be aware that the execution of the SA by Deutsche was wholly dependent on the said legal opinion which was the first hurdle to overcome on 7 November 2007, before there could be any drawdown of whatever financing. Was it therefore probable that Thomas would put the cart before the horse and enquire about the drawdown instead of Deutsche's decision on the SA? We do not think so. On 6 November 2007 and 7 November 2007, parties were fully immersed in the legal opinion on the "legality etc" of the SA. All things considered, it would not seem probable that Thomas would have enquired on a drawdown, which had nothing to do with the matter at hand and which had not been raised at all in any of the email exchanges. On the probabilities, it could only seem that Thomas must have enquired on Deutsche's decision on the SA, which "had escalated to London for consideration" (976AR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> If truth be told, the evidence could not support the claim on a balance of probabilities. Rather, we are of the view that if the mandate letter had been constructed as a whole, that if the entire evidence had been fully considered, and that if the pertinent law had been sufficiently explored, the following findings and or conclusions should pan out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> The LV was not a novation agreement. The LV proposed amendments to the third draft of the SA. If the proposed amendments were mutually accepted, it would only reasonably follow, in line with the conventional practice, to amend the SA accordingly. Perhaps, in the situation where the contracting parties had a binding contract, a novation agreement or other document would have to serve to amend the terms of the contract. But that was not the situation in the present case. Deutsche had not executed the SA. If there were amendments to the SA, the simplest and most sensible thing to do was to amend the SA accordingly. Indeed, in the LV, MBf wrote, "we hereby agree that the terms of the Subscription Agreement be amended and revised in the following", which was consistent with revision of the SA. In the scheme of things, it would not seem that the LV was intended to accommodate the amendments. But be that as it may, it was the finding of the Court of Appeal that the variations would be accommodated by the LV. But that finding was wholly against the weight and grain of the evidence. The contemporaneous evidence attested that Deutsche was yet not committed to the SA, be it on 2 November 2007 or at any time thereafter. That was the consistent stand of Deutsche from beginning to end. When MBf made the request on 2 November 2007 at 20:15 to sign the SA, Barry Weisblatt immediately made it known, on 2 November 2007 at 20:47, that Deutsche was not in a position to sign (see 1740AR). On 6 November 2007, Deutsche informed MBf of the requirement for the said legal opinion, which should convey to MBf that Deutsche was still not in a position to sign the SA. In addition, there were Deutsche's internal but nonetheless 'real-time' emails to its solicitor and Raja Ali (1811 and 1829AR), which stated that Deutsche had not the approval, not even on 7 November 2007, to sign the SA. All those were the irrefutable proof that Deutsche was yet not commited to the SA. On top of that, there were MBf's two emails on 6 November 2007, wherein MBf effectively admitted that the terms were not settled and that Deutsche was yet not commited to the final terms. It was so incontestably clear that Deutsche was yet not commited to the SA. Given so, the reasonable finding should have been that consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms was not reached on 2 November 2007. On that, the trial court was right. But the trial court was in error in its finding that there was no binding contract solely by reason of nonexecution. A binding contract could come into being without the formality of an executed agreement. But if the formality of an executed agreement was a prerequisite for the formation of a binding contract, then no binding contract could come into being without execution of the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> In the instant case, it was not only agreed that a separate agreement must be executed, which was admitted by Thomas, but also that the internal credit approval must have been obtained. Thomas testified that on 1 November 2007, Raja Ali informed him that internal credit was in place. But that oral testimony of Thomas was the only bit of evidence that affirmed so, but which was not supported by any of the contemporaneous emails or any of MBf's documents, and was refuted by Raja Ali (976AR). In a letter dated 26 November 2007 to Deutsche, MBf listed the "chronology of events" that allegedly led to a binding contract on 2 November 2007. But the internal credit approval in place was not mentioned at all. In fact, Thomas agreed that in "none of its documents prior to the filing of the writ, was there any suggestion that Raja Ali told [him] on 1st of November 2007 that internal credit approval was in place" (542AR) and that "the only time that [he] made the statement of an alleged representation by Raja Ali of such internal approval was when [he] filed the statement of claim in March 2008, after engaging lawyers" (543AR). The irresistible evidence from the contemporaneous emails, which could not be contrived after the event, was that the internal credit approval was never in place. The only opposing evidence was Thomas' oral ipsit dixit which had never been raised but was only raised, for the first time in March 2008, well after the event and only when the writ was filed. Fairly said, based on the evidence when properly evaluated, it was no contest. It got to be that the internal credit control was never in place and as such, condition (g) was never fulfilled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> Needless to say, without Deutsche's execution of the SA, which even Thomas admitted was required (see 484AR), condition (h) was also not satisfied. Without Deutsche's execution of the SA, no binding contract could come into being. The instant bargain was not a transaction where mere agreement on parties, property and price could bring about a binding contract, as was the case in <i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i>, where it was held by the Federal Court per Gopal Sri Ram JCA, as he then was, "that the phrase 'subject to the sale and purchase agreement' relied on by counsel for the appellant does not, in our judgment, point to an intention that no contract was to come into existence until a formal sale and purchase agreement had been prepared and executed". The "subject to contract" in <i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i> belonged to the first or second case stated in <i>Masters v. Cameron</i>. But the instant "subject to contract" was the third case stated in <i>Masters v. Cameron</i>, as the intention of the parties was not to make a concluded bargain at all unless until they execute the SA, quite unlike in <i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i>, where the "intention that no contract was to come into existence until a formal sale and purchase agreement had been prepared and executed" was not made out. But the distinction, with respect, was not perceived by the Court of Appeal who, not surprisingly thereafter, felled into error in applying <i>Charles Grenier Sdn Bhd v. Lau Wing Hong</i>, which was a land transaction and where the "subject to contract" was not the third case stated in <i>Masters v. Cameron</i>. The Court of Appeal also erred in applying <i>Lee Chin Kok v. Jasmin Arunthuthu Allegakoen &amp; Ors</i>, as the intention of the instant case was not to make a concluded bargain at all unless until they execute the SA. The formality of an executed agreement was by choice. The court should give effect to that intention and not foist an informal contract, which is not the practice of financial institutions (<i>Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v. William Derek Carlyle</i> [2014] SCLR 167 paras 60 and 61; see also <i>Oceanografia SA de CV v. DSND Subsea AS (The "Botnica")</i> at paras 81 and 82) and is highly unlikely in complex and intricate bargains (see <i>Cheverny Consulting Ltd v. Whitehead Mann Ltd</i>), upon Deutsche. The Court of Appeal also got it wrong in applying <i>OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v. Wong Hua Choo</i>, where it was admitted that there was a binding oral contract (see paras 58 and 59) and execution of the formal agreement was a mere formality, the facts of which were so very different from the instant case. But even if consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms had been reached, it remained that conditions (g) and (h) were not fulfilled. Even if condition (g) had been fulfilled, there was no executed agreement to bring about a binding contract. In short, the claim could not succeed. The result must be put right. Before we get to that, we need to answer the leave questions, but only 1.1 to 1.5, as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> Unless required by law, the formality of an executed agreement is an exception rather than the rule. Where there is no executed agreement, the court will be required to find whether negotiations and exchanges had crystallised into a concluded, albeit informal, contract. Each case must turn on its own facts. "The established rule is that in interpreting a contract, it is permissible to look at the factual matrix, but the evidence of negotiations and statements of subjective intention must be disregarded ... But it is inapplicable when the issue is, instead, one of contract formation. It is likewise inapplicable when rectification is claimed: evidence of negotiations and all other surrounding circumstances will be received" (<i>Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v. Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd</i> per Richardson P, Keith, Blanchard and McGrath JJ). In the case of a complex bargain, it will be more challenging to find the consensus <i>ad idem</i> on the terms. "The general principle in English law is that all contracts are governed by the same principles; and that the rules for the formation, contents and remedies apply equally to all contracts" (Contract Law: An Introduction to the English Law of Contract for the Civil Lawyer by John Cartwright at p 53). Unless required by law, there is no rule that a complex and intricate bargain cannot be concluded by an informal contract. To ensure that no premature binding contract is concluded through negotiations and exchanges, whether written or oral, it should be made amply clear that all negotiations and exchanges are subject to contract, and that parties are not bound until execution and exchange of a formal contract, as in the third case stated in <i>Masters v. Cameron</i>. There is, arguably, a fourth case of 'subject to contract, similar to the first and second cases, arising where the parties to be bound immediately with the expectation to include additional terms to be negotiated upon in a further contract in substitution of the first contract (see <i>Sinclair Scott &amp; Co Ltd v. Naughton</i> [1929] 43 CLR 310 at 317, <i>John R Keith Pty Ltd v Multiplex Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [2002] NSWSC 43 at 218- 237, and <i>Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v. GR Securities Pty Ltd</i> [1986] 40 NSWLR 622; see also Michael Furmston &amp; GJ Tolhurst '<i>Contract Formation: Law and Practice</i>' at paras 9.20, 9.61-9.63). There is no special form of words to be used in order that there shall be no binding contract before execution of the agreement, so long as the formality by choice of an executed agreement to bring about a binding contract is disclosed by the language employed as a whole.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> There was no concluded contract in the instant case. One reason was the absence of an executed agreement, which was an agreed element for the formation of a binding contract. Both must sign the SA (see <i>Cheverny Consulting Ltd v. Whitehead Mann Ltd</i> at paras 45 and 46). Pursuant to the mandate letter, "It was open to either party, at any time before the entry into such a formal contract, to withdraw from the negotiations ..." (<i>Taylor v. Burton &amp; Anor</i> [2015] EWCA Civ 142 per Sir Colin Rimer (Ryder LJ agreeing). By that, the mandate letter had provided for the application of <i>locus poenitentiae</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In view of what is about to be pronounced, we need not answer leave questions 1.7 to 1.9.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> For reasons given aforesaid, we, the remaining judges of the court (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;78.;;">s 78 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>) following the resignation of Mohamed Apandi Ali FCJ, as he then was, now AG, unanimously allow this appeal with costs, here and below, to the appellant. Accordingly, we set aside all orders of the Court of Appeal and restore the orders of the trial court, in particular, the order of dismissal of the entire claim.</p>
