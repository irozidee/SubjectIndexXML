    <p>The plaintiff (the appellant in this appeal) was the rider of a motorcycle and sued the 1st defendant, the driver of a car that had collided with her motorcycle. The 2nd defendant was the owner of the car and was sued for vicarious liability for the negligence committed by the 1st defendant. The defendants (the respondents) pleaded contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. At the Sessions Court, the defendants were not present at the trial. Although their counsel was present, they did not adduce any evidence. At the end of the trial, the learned Sessions Court judge found the defendants liable for the accident and 'apportioned 50% liability' to the defendants. The Sessions Court judge also made a finding of liability against the plaintiff and 'apportioned' the 'remaining 50% liability' to the plaintiff. On the issue of quantum of damages, the Sessions Court judge awarded damages amounting to RM45,000 to the plaintiff for open fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening, and RM80,000 to the plaintiff as costs for future operations, among others. Dissatisfied, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Sessions Court, whilst the defendants cross-appealed against the same. The plaintiff's appeal to the High Court was against the finding of liability as well as on the quantum of damages awarded by the Sessions Court. On the issue of liability, the plaintiff argued that the Sessions Court judge erred in finding the plaintiff liable for contributory negligence. On the issue of quantum of damages, it was argued that the Sessions Court judge had erred in her decision when she failed to make an award for damages for skin grafting. Counsel for the plaintiff also raised issue on the manifestly low award for fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening. The defendants' cross-appeal in the High Court was against the decision of the Sessions Court in making an award for cost of future operations. The High Court dismissed both the plaintiff's appeal and the defendants' cross-appeal. The appellant appealed and the defendants cross-appealed against the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appellant's appeal and dismissing the defendants' cross-appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The learned High Court judge fell into error when accepting the learned Sessions Court judge's finding that the plaintiff was speeding at the material time. The learned Sessions Court judge arrived at this finding based on the 1st defendant's police report, a document that was never tendered as evidence in court. Since the 1st defendant did not attend court to testify, her police report was never tendered as evidence before the Sessions Court. As such, both the learned Sessions Court and High Court judges should have ignored the 1st defendant's police report completely when deliberating on the finding of liability. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Except for the evidence of the plaintiff herself that she was riding her motorcycle at 50 kilometers per hour on the fateful day when the collision took place, there was no evidence at all to the effect that the plaintiff was speeding, or had exceeded the prescribed speed limit for the stretch of road in question. The Investigating Officer was never cross-examined on the speed limit of the stretch of road where the accident occurred. With due respect, this court disagreed with the learned Sessions Court judge's finding of speeding on the part of the plaintiff merely based on the extent of the damage to the 1st defendant's car as seen in the photographs. That being the case, the learned Sessions Court judge erred when she made an inference that the plaintiff was speeding, or that the plaintiff had contributed to the accident and was thus liable for contributory negligence. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The learned Sessions Court judge should not have 'apportioned' liability between the parties, and should not use such expression as 'liabililti sebanyak 50% plaintif dan defendan 50%' if what she had meant was that the plaintiff was only guilty of contributory negligence and that, therefore, the award should, accordingly, be reduced by 50%. For, the expression used by the learned Sessions Court judge gave the erroneous impression that both the plaintiff and the 1st defendant were co-tortfeasors and each equally guilty (50:50) of the tort of negligence; whereas in truth there was only one tortfeasor who was guilty of the tort of negligence: the 1st defendant, who was wholly liable (that was to say, 100%) for the accident. The plaintiff was only the victim and could only be - if at all - liable for contributory negligence. Contributory negligence is not the tort of negligence. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Nowhere in the learned Sessions Court judge's grounds of judgment did she justify how she arrived at the sum of RM45,000 for the fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening. The learned Sessions Court judge failed to follow the current trend of cases in awarding damages. In the present case, the CT Scanogram conducted by the medical specialists found that the plaintiff had between 4 and 5 cm shortening of her right leg. This court therefore, set aside the award of RM45,000 ordered by the Sessions Court for fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening, and substituted it with an award of RM80,000. (paras 32-33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Upon perusal of the evidence, including photographs on the skin grafting performed on the plaintiff, and the current trend of the courts to grant a separate award for skin grafting, this court made an award of RM25,000 as damages to the plaintiff for skin grafting. This court found that a separate award for skin grafting ought to have been made by the learned Sessions Court judge, and disagreed with the learned High Court judge that the global award made was adequate. This court noted the extent of skin grafting done on the plaintiff, and found that it was only reasonable that an award of damages be made under this heading. (para 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Due to the permanent shortening of the leg suffered by the plaintiff, she would require further operations. The defendants' expert witness in his report too had admitted that the plaintiff had permanent shortening of the leg. Due to this disability, coupled with the plaintiff's young age, it was very likely that the plaintiff would require further operations. The court thus dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal. (para 39)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appeal before us emanates from the High Court of Shah Alam, namely, Shah Alam High Court Civil Appeal No: 12B-138-03-2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appeal is by the plaintiff (the appellant before us) against the decision of the learned High Court Judge dated 15 April 2014 dismissing the plaintiff's appeal against the decision of the learned Sessions Court Judge dated 27 February 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> There is also before us a cross-appeal by the defendants (the respondents before us) against the dismissal of its cross-appeal by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff's claim in the Sessions Court against the defendants was for negligence arising from a road accident. The plaintiff was the rider of a motorcycle and is suing the 1st defendant, the driver of a car that had collided with her motorcycle. The 2nd defendant is the owner of the car and is sued for vicarious liability for the negligence committed by the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The defendants pleaded contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Sessions Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the Sessions Court, the defendants were not present at the trial. Although their counsel was present, they did not adduce any evidence. At the end of the trial, the learned Sessions Court Judge found the defendants liable for the accident and "apportioned 50% liability" to the defendants. The learned judge also made a finding of liability against the plaintiff and "apportioned" the "remaining 50% liability" to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the issue of quantum of damages, the learned Sessions Court Judge awarded damages amounting to RM45,000 to the plaintiff for open fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening, and RM80,000 to the plaintiff as costs for future operations, among others.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Dissatisfied, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Sessions Court, whilst the defendants cross-appealed against the same. The plaintiff's appeal to the High Court was against the finding of liability as well as on the quantum of damages awarded by the Sessions Court. On the issue of liability, learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the learned Sessions Court Judge erred in finding the plaintiff liable for contributory negligence. Instead, it was argued, the 1st defendant was wholly to be blamed for the accident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the issue of quantum of damages, it was argued by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the learned Sessions Court Judge had erred in her decision when she failed to make an award for damages for skin grafting. The learned
counsel also raised issue on the manifestly low award of RM45,000 for fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The defendants' cross-appeal in the High Court was against the decision of the Sessions Court in making an award for cost of future operations. The defendants contended that the plaintiff would not be requiring any further operations, as such the Sessions Court should not have granted damages for cost of future operations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The High Court dismissed both the plaintiff's appeal and the defendants' cross-appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Hence, this appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 12 February 2015, we allowed the plaintiff's appeal with costs against the decision of the High Court and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal. The decision of the High Court was accordingly set aside; and the decision of the Sessions Court was varied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Our decision was unanimous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Grounds For Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We now give our grounds for allowing the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We will begin by setting out briefly the facts of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(a) The Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The plaintiff was 20 years old at the time of the accident. The accident occurred on 20 April 2010. According to the plaintiff (PW2), on that fateful day, she was riding her motorcycle along Jalan Klang-Banting, Selangor, when suddenly, a car from the opposite direction, driven by the 1st defendant, without any signal, turned into her path. The 1st defendant's car was heading for a junction that was on the plaintiff's left. The plaintiff was unable to avoid the 1st defendant's car. The car collided into the plaintiff's motorcycle. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff suffered extensive injuries, the most severe of which was on her right leg. Since the accident, the plaintiff had to undergo at least five surgeries on her right leg.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(b) On Liability</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As has been mentioned earlier, the 1st defendant was not present in court at the trial to offer evidence on how the collision occurred. As such, we only have the plaintiff's evidence on the events leading up to the collision. The Investigating Officer of the case (PW1) tendered as evidence, the sketch plan (exh P1) as well as photographs of the scene and of the vehicles involved in the accident (exh P2 A-D).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> At the end of the trial, the learned Sessions Court Judge made an inference, based on the 1st defendant's police report and the photographs tendered, that the plaintiff was speeding at the material time. The relevant part of the learned Sessions Court Judge's grounds of judgment is reproduced below (at p 3):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The learned High Court Judge was in complete agreement with the learned Sessions Court Judge that the plaintiff was speeding at the material time. This, the learned High Court Judge held, was based on the police report of the 1st defendant and the photographs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We have had the opportunity to scrutinise all the documentary evidence adduced at the trial court, and with due respect, we are unable to agree with the learned Sessions Court Judge that the plaintiff was liable for contributory negligence. There are two reasons for this. The first is that, the learned High Court Judge, with due respect, fell into error when accepting the learned Sessions Court Judge's finding that the plaintiff was speeding at the material time. The learned Sessions Court Judge arrived at this finding based on the 1st defendant's police report, a document that was never tendered as evidence in court. We hardly need to stress here that a court is only bound to consider evidence that has been properly tendered before it and admitted as evidence. Anything else should be completely disregarded by the court. In the present case, the fact remains that since the 1st defendant did not attend court to testify, her police report was never tendered as evidence before the Sessions Court. As such, both the learned Sessions Court and High Court Judges should have ignored the 1st defendant's police report completely when deliberating on the finding of liability. We find that, with due respect, the learned High Court Judge erred in law in assuming that just because the 1st defendant's police report formed part of the plaintiff's documents, therefore, the police report was admissible evidence in court, and which evidence the Sessions Court Judge could consider in arriving at her judgment. In this regard, we find that it is necessary to reproduce the relevant portion of the learned High Court Judge's judgment (as found at p 5 of the judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b>On the failure of the 1st defendant to testify, we wish to associate ourselves with the Federal Court's decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_74;"><i>Takako Sakao v. Ng Pek Yuen &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 74</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 751; [2010] 1 CLJ 381 where Gopal Sri Ram FCJ (as he then was) said (at p 77 of the judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b>On the admissibility of the 1st defendant's police report, we wish to refer to the dictum of the High Court in the unreported case of <i>Chuah Ah Chee &amp; Ors v. Gurdial Singh &amp; Anor</i> (Civil Suit No: 351 of 1979, High Court, Penang) (unreported) which was subsequently cited with approval by the Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_605;"><i>Jaafar Shaari &amp; Siti Jama Hashim v. Tan Lip Eng &amp; Anor</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 605</LINK>; [1997] 3 MLJ 693; [1997] 4 CLJ 509 (at p 616 of the judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The second reason why we find the decision of the High Court flawed is because the learned High Court Judge found the plaintiff liable for contributory negligence, based on the allegation that the plaintiff was speeding. We are, with due respect, unable to accept that the plaintiff should be faulted for her misfortune. We have scrutinised the evidence before the Sessions Court, but we are unable to find an iota of evidence to point to the fact that she was speeding at the material time when the accident occurred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In this regard, we agree with learned counsel for the plaintiff that the learned Sessions Court Judge should not have made a finding that the plaintiff was speeding in the absence of any evidence to that effect. We find that, except for the evidence of the plaintiff herself that she was riding her motorcycle at 50 kilometers per hour on the fateful day when the collision took place, there was no evidence at all to the effect that the plaintiff was speeding, or had exceeded the prescribed speed limit for the stretch of road in question. The Investigating Officer (PW1) was never cross-examined on the speed limit of the stretch of road where the accident occurred. With due respect, we disagree with the learned Sessions Court Judge's finding of speeding on the part of the plaintiff merely based on the extent of the damage to the 1st defendant's car as seen in the photographs. That being the case, the learned Sessions Court Judge erred when she made an inference that the plaintiff was speeding, or that the plaintiff had contributed to the accident and thus liable for contributory negligence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> For the above reasons, we find that the plaintiff was not liable for contributory negligence and that both the learned judges of the lower courts had erred when they ruled to the contrary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> At this juncture, we also wish to note with dismay the approach adopted by the learned Sessions Court Judge in establishing liability and contributory negligence against the plaintiff. The learned Sessions Court Judge seemed to have directed her mind to a completely wrong approach when making a finding of liability and contributory negligence. Instead of asking herself whether the 1st defendant was liable for the tort of negligence, it is clear from her grounds of judgment that she straight away proceeded to scrutinise the conduct of the plaintiff. The present case, being a claim for the tort of negligence, the appropriate approach should have been for the learned Sessions Court Judge, first and foremost, to make a finding of mixed fact and law whether or not the 1st defendant had breached her legal duty of care towards the plaintiff. Only once negligence had been established against the 1st defendant should the learned Sessions Court Judge then proceed to determine contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, if any (since contributory negligence is pleaded): whether the plaintiff's actions were such that the plaintiff had contributed to the injury or damage that she suffered. In this regard, we wish to refer to the High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_5_207;"><i>Lee Hock Lai v. Yeoh Wah Pein</i> [1998] 5 MLRH 207</LINK>; [1999] 5 MLJ 172 where the reasoning process was explained (at p 208 of the judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Now, considering the manner the grounds of judgment of the learned Sessions Court Judge was written, we are impelled to add here that the learned Sessions Court Judge should not have "apportioned" liability between the parties, and should not use such expression as "liabililti sebanyak 50% plaintif dan defendan 50%" if what she had meant was that the plaintiff was only guilty of contributory negligence and that, therefore, the award should, accordingly, be reduced by 50%. For, the expression used by the learned Sessions Court Judge gives the erroneous impression that both the plaintiff and the 1st defendant were co-tortfeasors and each equally guilty (50:50) of the tort of negligence; whereas in truth there was only one tortfeasor who was guilty of the tort of negligence: the 1st defendant, who was wholly liable (that is to say, 100%) for the accident. The plaintiff was only the victim and could only be - if at all - liable for contributory negligence. Contributory negligence is not the tort of negligence. One must not get confused between liability for the tort of negligence and liability for contributory negligence. Assuming for the moment that the learned Sessions Court Judge court were to find the plaintiff liable for contributory negligence, then she must reduce the damages awarded by the court accordingly, say, 10% or 20% or 30%, as the case may be, in accordance with her assessment as to the extent of the contribution on the part of the plaintiff pertaining to the injury or damages that she had suffered. And assuming that the Sessions Court were to find the plaintiff liable for contributory negligence and that the award must be reduced accordingly, say, by 50%, it does not follow that 1st defendant's liability for the tort of negligence must consequently be reduced to 50%. The 1st defendant's liability for the tort of negligence still remains 100%. (But in the instant case we have found the plaintiff not at all liable for contributory negligence.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> For a better understanding of contributory negligence, it is instructive to refer to (a) <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;12.;;">s 12 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> and (b) the decision of the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1977_1_321;"><i>Kek Kee Leng v. Teresa Bong Nguk Chin &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRA 321</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;12.;;">Section 12 of the Civil Law Act</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In <i>Kek Kee Leng v. Teresa Bong Nguk Chin &amp; Anor</i>, the Federal Court held (at p 324 of the judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>(c) On Quantum Of Damages</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(i) Fracture Of The Right Tibia And Fibula With 5cm Shortening</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On quantum, the first issue raised by the learned counsel for the plaintiff before us, is that, the award of damages of RM45,000 for the fracture of the right tibia and fibula with 5 cm shortening, was extremely low and disproportionate to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, taking into account the fact that she had to undergo five surgeries after the accident. It was thus submitted by the learned counsel that based on the dearth of case law on this area of injury, a figure of RM80,000 as damages, would be a more reasonable and proportionate amount.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The learned High Court Judge found the amount awarded by the learned Sessions Court Judge was not manifestly low to justify judicial intervention, and dismissed the plaintiff's appeal on this issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> With due respect, we are unable to agree with the learned High Court Judge. On the contrary, we agree with learned counsel for the plaintiff that the amount of damages awarded by the trial court was manifestly low. We find that nowhere in the learned Sessions Court Judge's grounds of judgment did she justify how she arrived at the sum of RM45,000 for the above injury. We also find that the learned Sessions Court Judge failed to follow the current trend of cases in awarding damages. We wish to refer to the trend of cases on this heading of injury, including <i>Abdul Malek bin Long v. Wan Muhammad bin Wan Abdullah &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 1 PIR [15] where the trial court awarded damages of RM65,000 for closed fracture of the left tibia plateau and neck of fibula, with 1.5 cm shortening of the leg, and <i>Zulkifli bin Rashid &amp; Anor v. Sivasubramaniam a/l Varathan &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 2 PIR [48] in which the Sessions Court awarded RM50,000 for fracture of the right tibia and fibula with 2cm shortening of the right leg.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In the present case, the CT Scanogram conducted by the medical specialists found that the plaintiff had between 4 and 5 cm shortening of her right leg. We, therefore, set aside the award of RM45,000 ordered by the Sessions Court for fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening, and substitute it with an award of RM80,000. We do not find the amount given by the Sessions Court as reasonable, and think that RM80,000 is a more reasonable and fair amount to reflect the severity of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, as well as taking into account inflation due to the passage of time. <i>Abdul Malek bin Long</i> was decided in 2007 whilst the present case was decided by the Sessions Court in 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(ii) Skin Grafting</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff also raised an issue on the failure of the Sessions Court Judge to award damages for skin grafting done on the plaintiff. It was argued by learned counsel that a separate award should be made for this injury, and that the learned Sessions Judge had erred in her judgment when she did not consider an award for skin grafting. Before us, the learned counsel for the defendants did not seriously address on this issue of a separate award for skin grafting. The learned High Court Judge held that since the Sessions Court had made a global award for all the injuries suffered by the plaintiff (including RM8,000 for scarring), therefore there was no necessity to make a separate award for skin grafting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In this regard, learned counsel for the plaintiff drew our attention to the case of <i>Musa bin Jusoh v. Mazlan bin Bidin &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 1 PIR [8], a Sessions Court decision where the court made separate awards for fracture, scarring and skin grafting, namely RM20,000 for skin grafting and another RM30,000 for scarring. Relying on the above authority, learned counsel for the plaintiff urged us to consider a separate award for skin grafting and proposed that RM25,000 would be a reasonable figure for skin grafting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Upon perusing the evidence before us, including photographs on the skin grafting performed on the plaintiff, and the current trend of the courts to grant a separate award for skin grafting, we make an award of RM25,000 as damages to the plaintiff for skin grafting. We find that a separate award for skin grafting ought to have been made by the learned Sessions Court Judge, and disagree, with due respect, with the learned High Court Judge that the global award made was adequate. We note the extent of skin grafting done on the plaintiff, and find that it is only reasonable that an award of damages be made under this heading.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(d) On The Cross-Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We now turn to the defendants' cross-appeal. The defendants' cross-appeal is against the decision of the High Court in dismissing its appeal there for cost of future operations, wherein the Sessions Court had awarded the plaintiff RM80,000. Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that the learned Sessions Court Judge should not have awarded any damages under this heading. This, learned counsel contended, was based on the expert opinion of Dr Kuldip Singh a/l Swaran Singh (DW1), who testified that the plaintiff would not require any further operations for her injuries, and the medical report prepared by DW1 (exh D8), which concluded the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The plaintiff's expert witness, Dr Suntharalingam a/l Subramaniam (PW4), testified that due to the shortening of the plaintiff's right leg, the plaintiff would require further operations for the lengthening of her leg, and suggested that the operations would cost RM80,000. PW4 strongly recommended future operations for the plaintiff, taking into account her young age and her disability to walk properly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We have considered both the experts' evidence and we find that the plaintiff would indeed require further operations. In this regard, we prefer to associate ourselves with the opinion of PW4, who opined that due to the permanent shortening of the leg suffered by the plaintiff, she would require further operations. DW1 in his report too had admitted that the plaintiff has permanent shortening of the leg. We take note that due to this disability, coupled with the plaintiff's young age, it is very likely that the plaintiff would require further operations. We thus dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Therefore, for the reasons stated above, we allowed the plaintiff's appeal, and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal with costs of RM15,000 for here and below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The order of the Sessions Court to the effect that the liabilities of the parties are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>is varied. Since we find the defendants wholly (100%) liable in negligence towards the plaintiff, and that there is no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, accordingly, we vary the Sessions Court order with an order that the defendants be held 100% liable towards the plaintiff for the accident, with no liability for contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff in respect of the injury or damages that she had suffered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> On quantum, the order of the Sessions Court is now varied in that the award for the fracture of the right tibia and fibula with shortening is now increased to RM80,000. There is also a separate award for skin grafting in the sum of RM25,000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We affirm the rest of the award of the Sessions Court.</p>
    <p>
      <i>[Appeal is allowed with costs, cross-appeal is dismissed with costs, order of the Sessions Court varied accordingly]</i>
    </p>
