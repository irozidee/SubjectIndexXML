    <p>The present appeal concerned a defamation action by the plaintiffs against the defendants which was related to an article published in the 'Harakah'. The 1st defendant was the writer of the article and a Member of the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly for the Batu Burok Constituency. The 2nd and 3rd defendants were the holder of the Publication Permit and the Chief Editor of 'Harakah' respectively. The 4th defendant was the printer of 'Harakah'. The court had held that the defendants had only libelled the 2nd plaintiff (amongst three plaintiffs) and had ordered general and exemplary damages in the sum of RM200,000.00 in favour of the 2nd plaintiff. The finding of the court was that the defence of qualified privilege had been established by the 1st defendant, in that the statement was made on a privileged occasion. Nevertheless, according to the learned judge, the 1st defendant failed to act reasonably or responsibly and, therefore, had acted intentionally and with malice, which thereby negated the defence of qualified privilege. Hence, the present appeal by the defendants against the decision of the trial court. The main issue for contention in this appeal was whether the learned trial judge was entitled to decide on the issue of 'malice' (against the defendants), considering the failure of the plaintiffs to comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> ("<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK>").</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Aside from the accepted two-stage assessment (of whether the statement was defamatory and the defences relied upon by the defendants) by the court in a defamation suit, there would follow a further stage of enquiry where the court upon the second stage of evaluation had determined that the defendant was entitled on the facts to have the claim dismissed on the grounds that the defence of either qualified privilege or fair comment (on a matter of public interest) had been established. This so-called third stage of enquiry, required in law, was to ascertain whether actual or express 'malice' had been established by the plaintiff by way of rebuttal, to extinguish either of those defences. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was an established principle of law that particulars of the fact and matters from which malice was to be inferred by the court had to be specifically pleaded 'so that the truth and correctness of the particulars relied upon can be checked and verified' by the trial judge. No inference or conclusion on 'malice' could ensue at all unless there was such a pleading. Reverting back then to the meaning that ought to be reasonably ascribed to the words used in the earlier part of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK>, namely, 'where ... the plaintiff alleges that the defendant maliciously published the words or matters complained of, he need not in his statement of claim give particulars of the facts or which he relies in support of the allegation of malice ...' The tenor of the language used did not rule out or exclude the possibility of the plaintiff pleading 'the particulars of the facts and matters from which malice is to be inferred' in the statement of claim itself. If so done, it then followed that a reply specifically setting out the same particulars of the facts and matters from which express malice was to be inferred, would be deemed to be redundant and superfluous. (paras 38-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> If one was to closely scrutinise the matters pleaded by the plaintiffs in the reply or even in the statement of claim in this case, it was beyond any doubt that those averments there were bare statements with respect to malice on the part of the defendants with no particulars of the facts or detail of matters from which express malice could be inferred or attributed to the defendants. The plaintiffs had not condescended to providing any particulars as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK> at all. As such there was nothing on the records for the learned trial judge to even launch into the further third stage of enquiry as to whether the statements made on an occasion of qualified privilege had been motivated by actual or express malice, much less, to conclude that the plaintiffs had proven there was malice behind those statements made by the defendants. To re-emphasise, the conclusion of the trial court on this issue of 'malice' was therefore bereft of any valid basis. (paras 45-46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Obiter:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the light of developments in the law of defamation pertaining to defences open to newspapers or other media-related publications, based on what had come to be termed the '<i>Reynolds</i> Privilege', the question was whether it was still necessary to consider or determine the issue of express 'malice' or whether it was relevant to still insist on the requirement that 'particulars as to facts and matters (from which the court was to make an inference of malice) had to be pleaded at all by the plaintiffs. The developments surrounding that area of law showed that the '<i>Reynolds</i> Privilege' as a defence was always treated and recognised as a separate and distinct defence in contrast to the conventional common law defence of qualified privilege. In the instant case, however, the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege was not raised as a separate or even as a specie of the defence of qualified privilege. The plaintiffs could not in any case, avail of (nor could this court volunteer) the benefit of some of the observations, as it would appear, in this area of law following the <i>Reynolds</i> decision or in the subsequent cases which had considered the <i>Reynolds</i> privilege, which arguably was to the effect of obviating or dispensing with the need for the court to consider any issue pertaining to express malice, much less, any issue as to whether there was sufficiently pleaded or not, particulars of fact or matters from which an inference of 'malice' was to be made, as was required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK>.

    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal by the defendants was against the decision of the High Court (28 February 2014) in a defamation action. The court had held that the defendants had only libelled the 2nd plaintiff (amongst three plaintiffs) and had ordered general and exemplary damages in the sum of RM200,000.00 in favour of the 2nd plaintiff.</p>
    <p>(In this judgment the parties will, for convenience, be referred to as they were at the High Court).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The action by the plaintiffs was related to an article bearing the heading "Seleweng RM30j bantuan sekolah?" published in the '11 to 13 November 2011'-Issue of the 'Harakah'. The 1st defendant was the writer of the article and a Member of the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly for the Batu Burok Constituency. The 2nd and 3rd defendants were the holder of the Publication Permit and the Chief Editor of Harakah respectively. The 4th defendant was the printer of Harakah.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The 2nd plaintiff was at the material time the Menteri Besar of the State of Terengganu.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In para 24 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs specifically identified the alleged defamatory content in the article and the same is reproduced here in full:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The 'Laporan Ketua Audit Negara - Aktiviti Jabatan/Agensi dan Pengurusan Syarikat Kerajaan Negeri Terengganu, Tahun 2010', more particularly material under the caption 'Program Bantuan Pakaian dan Alatan Sekolah', formed the backdrop, as it so appeared in the defence and at trial, for the matters commended upon and/or questioned in the impugned article in Harakah. This source material was not in dispute. The said Laporan by the Federal Auditor General had been laid before both, the Federal Parliament and at the Terengganu State Legislative Assembly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned High Court Judge in the alasan penghakiman in this case had adopted the paragraph-numbering, namely, paras (a) to (g) in para 24 of statement of claim reproduced above, to premise the sequence of Her Ladyship's deliberations and consequent findings with respect to the alleged defamatory material in this case. Ideally, the said impugned paragraphs in the statement of claim should have been considered in the context of the whole published article but this was not the approach adopted by the trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Judgment Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned judge correctly affirmed that there was a two-stage process involved when a defamation suit was being adjudicated upon by the court. The initial burden was on the plaintiff to show:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned judge noted that the publication of the article was not being disputed here by the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As regards the issue whether the words or statements complained of were capable of bearing a defamatory meaning, it was the learned judge's conclusion that only paras (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) were capable of a defamatory meaning or effect. This finding was expressed in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On the question of whether the words or statements complained of referred to the plaintiffs, the learned judge had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The conclusion reached was that the alleged defamatory passages referred only to the 2nd plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Moving on then to the second stage of the enquiry, the learned judge noted that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(namely, that the defences were qualified privilege, or alternatively, fair comment).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On whether the defence of qualified privilege had been established on evidence, the learned judge held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The finding of the court was therefore that the defence of qualified privilege had been established by the 1st defendant, in that, the statement (bearing the defamatory tendency) was made on a privileged occasion. Nevertheless, according to the learned judge, the 1st defendant failed to act reasonably or responsibly and therefore, had acted intentionally and with malice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In respect of the defence of 'fair comment' the learned judge's comments were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A translation of the above extract bears out that the learned judge was of the view that for the defence of fair comment (on a matter of public importance) to succeed, it had to be based on 'facts'. In this case the learned judge added that the defendants had made 'untruthful statements' and therefore could not justify the statements as fair comment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The learned judge then went on to make the following observations on the issue of 'malice', which Her Ladyship had earlier correctly identified, would nonetheless negate the defence of qualified privilege (para 12 above) even if it had been proven by the defendants:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The conclusion of the trial court was summarised in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The defendants had appealed against the whole of the decision of the trial court. It must be registered here however that the 2nd plaintiff (or for that matter any of the other plaintiffs), had not filed an appeal (or any cross-appeal) against the findings of the learned judge (or any part of the same).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The finding of the court that the defendants had established that publication by the 1st defendant was made on an 'occasion' of or was protected by 'qualified privilege' was undoubtedly a material finding or conclusion of the court. The express finding of the learned judge in this respect, to repeat, was that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> At the outset of the hearing before us, we pointed out to counsel for the 2nd plaintiff (respondent before us) that there was no appeal by the plaintiffs on the specific finding of the court that the defendants were entitled to the defence of 'qualified privilege' and this would mean that the 2nd plaintiff was not challenging that finding by the court. Counsel confirmed that they were not pursuing an appeal on that finding, on account of the stance that they would be taking, namely, that the court had rightly held that there was 'malice' when the defendants published the alleged article and accordingly such a defence had by reason of that been negated or rendered inapplicable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Upon this clarification, counsel for the defendants (the appellants) opted not to pursue with his appeal to overturn the finding of the court that paras (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) were defamatory or capable of a defamatory meaning. Counsel then limited the appeal to the issue whether the learned trial judge was entitled to decide or was correct in Her Ladyship's conclusion on the issue of 'malice' (against the defendants), as was held here in this case. The submission of the defendants was specifically premised on the failure of the plaintiffs to comply with the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court 2012 ('ROC 2012')</LINK>, for any contention related to 'malice' to even take off or be considered in the first place by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Accordingly, both counsel agreed that the sole issue remaining for determination in this appeal was therefore whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK> had been satisfied or that sufficient particulars of the facts in support of the allegation of malice by the plaintiffs had been pleaded in the statement of claim and/ or the statement of reply, for the learned judge to deliberate upon, much less, conclude that the publication by the defendants was motivated by 'malice'. Counsel were allowed an adjournment to revise/supplement their submissions on this sole issue and address us further thereon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions - Summary</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The defendants submitted that to defeat qualified privilege pleaded by the defendants as a defence in the defamation action it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to file a reply giving particulars of the facts and matters from which express malice was to be inferred by the court. This it was asserted was a mandatory prerequisite pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK> and here in this case it had not been complied with by the plaintiffs. In the absence of such necessary particulars of facts and matters from which an inference of malice could be made, the learned judge, it was submitted, had no basis to even address the question of 'malice' and was therefore clearly in error or had misdirected herself when she held that 'malice' had been 'proven' and the defendants' successful defence of qualified privilege had been consequently defeated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It was also contended that vague and general assertions as to 'niat jahat' in the reply, or even in the statement of claim that were filed by the plaintiffs were in any event insufficient to provide a sustainable basis for the learned judge's conclusion that malice on the part of the defendants had been established on the evidence; what was required were particulars and facts with some specificity to be pleaded for the court to draw such inference that the impugned statements were actuated by 'malice' on the part of the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contended that both the statement of claim and the reply contained sufficient averments to show that the statements attributed to the defendants and the subject of these proceedings were actuated by malice, and the learned judge was therefore correct in holding that 'malice' has been established to demolish the defence of qualified privilege ruled in the defendants' favour in this matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Deliberation And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Two preliminary observations have to be made at the outset. The first was that, aside from the accepted two-stage assessment by the court in a defamation suit, it needs to be pointed out that there would follow a further stage of enquiry where the court upon the second stage of evaluation had determined that the defendant was entitled on the facts to have the claim dismissed on the grounds that the defence of either qualified privilege or fair comment (on a matter of public interest) has been established. This so-called third-stage of enquiry, required in law, was to ascertain whether actual or express 'malice'had been established by the plaintiff by way of rebuttal, to extinguish either of those defences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The second point in the particular context of this case was that, although the learned judge had found that the defendants could not avail themselves of the defence of 'fair comment' (since the claimed 'facts' upon which the 1st defendant's comments were premised, had not been supposedly established in the first place), this defence of fair comment was only an alternative defence of the defendants. The principle defence raised by the defendants to the plaintiffs' action was 'qualified privilege', which defence, the learned judge had found to have been established.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the circumstances the court's finding on the defence of 'fair comment' which was adverse to the defendants, was of no consequence. It did not detract in any way from the conclusion arrived at by the court on the primary defence of 'qualified privilege' found in favour of the defendants and which, it must be reiterated, was not being appealed against.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> With respect to 'qualified privilege', it is instructive to recall that in <i>Adam v. Ward</i> [1917] AC 309, Lord Atkinson noted as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The learned judge had correctly identified and applied the principles of law involved in this area when, firstly, Her Ladyship found that the 1st defendant (as an ADUN) had a duty to make the statement as he did in the Harakah article and that 'orang ramai' (the public) had a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. As pointed out above, the court also appreciated the position in law that this defence of qualified privilege would in any event be negated if 'malice' on the part of the 1st defendant was shown.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The only issue therefore before us now was whether there was relevant material in the pleadings before the court for Her Ladyship to, firstly, consider and to move on then to conclude that the impugned statements were actuated by express 'malice', thereby putting to nought or neutralising completely that defence of qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In that context and in the light of the submissions of counsel for the respective parties, the two questions that had to be determined by this court were:</p>

      <b>[32]</b> There can be no dispute that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK> is a specific adjectival provision that had to be strictly complied with or adhered to, if one was intending to disqualify the defence of qualified privilege or fair comment on the grounds of express malice. The mandatory nature of this requirement had been affirmed by a long line of decisions of our courts.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> As regards the use of the term 'must' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK> and the imperative implication behind the use of that term in statutory or procedural parlance, our attention was drawn to the observation of the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_528;"><i>Duli Yang Amat Mulia Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj v.

      <b>[36]</b> Counsel for the 2nd plaintiff however submitted that on the authority of the Federal court's decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_34;"><i>Luk Kai Lam v. Sim Ai Leng</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 34</LINK>; [1979] 1 MLJ 24, the failure to file a reply setting out the particulars of express malice was not fatal to the plaintiffs' case in any event. In our reading the relevance of that decision (under the then O 19 r 22 of Supreme Court Rules 1957 where the word in contention was 'shall' and not 'must' in our present case), if at all was that such 'particulars of the facts and matters from which the malice is to be inferred' need not be confined to the reply filed but could even be set out in the statement of claim (discussed further below in this judgment).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> VT Singham J in the High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_1_685;"><i>M Prabhakaran v. Salam Seran</i> [2001] 1 MLRH 685</LINK>; [2001] 6 MLJ 368; [2001] 3 CLJ 615; [2001] 3 AMR 3209 had occasion to consider the decision in the <i>Luk Kai Lam</i> case and the then <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_328;43.;;">O 43 r 3(3) of the Subordinate Courts Rules 1980</LINK> (in  <i>pari materia</i> with the then <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;78.;;">O 78 r 3(3) of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> and the present <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;;">Rules of Court 2012</LINK>). This is what His Lordship held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Firstly therefore, it was an established principle of law that particulars of the fact and matters from which malice was to be inferred by the court had to be specifically pleaded 'so that the truth and correctness of the particulars relied upon can be checked and verified' by the trial judge. No inference or conclusion on 'malice' could ensue at all unless there was such a pleading.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Reverting back then to the meaning that ought to be reasonably ascribed to the words used in the earlier part of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK>, namely, "where ... the plaintiff alleges that the defendant maliciously published the words or matters complained of, he need not in his statement of claim give particulars of the facts or which he relies in support of the allegation of malice ..." It is our considered view that the tenor of the language used does not rule out or exclude the possibility of the plaintiff pleading 'the particulars of the facts and matters from which malice is to be inferred' in the statement of claim itself. If so done, it then followed that a reply specifically setting out the same particulars of the facts and matters from which express malice is to be inferred, would be deemed to be redundant and superfluous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> This then brings us to the crux of the question for our determination, namely, whether the plaintiffs' pleading found either in statement of claim or the reply did sufficiently satisfy the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK>. The requirement to provide specifically the particulars of the facts and matters from which express malice was to be inferred, was not a mere formality but was founded, in our view, on sound policy and practical considerations. It was to provide the defendants with advance notice as to the issues of fact to be met by the defendants to ensure that their defences of qualified privilege or fair comment was not denied from them ultimately. The defendants had to know with definiteness and some degree of precision how to rebut such an allegation of 'facts and material' underlying the plaintiffs' allegation of express malice. From that perspective there was no denying that it had serious evidential implications for the defendants, as the truth and veracity of those facts and material was also to be determined by the court within the one and same trial itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> This therefore called for a critical and objective examination of what was actually pleaded in this case by the plaintiffs in the reply and/or their statement of claim. The relevant averments as regards the defendants' alleged 'malicious' intent were found set out in the following paragraphs of the statement of claim:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In the reply filed by the plaintiffs there was no direct pleading adverting to any particulars of facts and matters as regards express 'malice' being the motive of the defendants in publishing the article in question. The only averment there in so far as the issue of 'qualified privilege' raised by the defendants was concerned were found at paras 8 and 15 of the reply reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> It is pertinent in this respect to note the commentary in <i>Gatley on 'Libel and Slander'</i> (11th edn) (at p 1037 para 36.5) on this procedural requirement of providing particulars from which 'malice' was to be inferred by the court. It was stated there as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> There is obviously a wide divide between merely or casually stating in the pleadings that the statements were made 'Maliciously' and meeting the requirement to provide the particulars of facts and matters from which express or actual malice is to be inferred to defeat the defence of qualified privilege or fair comment.</p>
    <p>In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_3_64;"><i>Halim Arsyat v. Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2001] 3 MLRH 64</LINK>; [2001] 6 MLJ 353; [2001] 7 CLJ 268; [2001] 4 AMR 4930, the court there most significantly noted as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> If one was to closely scrutinise the matters pleaded by the plaintiffs in the reply or even in the statement of claim in this case (as reproduced above), it was beyond any doubt that those averments there were bare and bland statements with respect to malice (niat jahat) on the part of the defendants with no particulars of the facts or detail of matters from which express malice could be inferred or attributed to the defendants. The plaintiffs had not condescended to providing any particulars as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK> at all.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> As such there was nothing on the records for the learned trial judge to even launch into the further third enquiry as to whether the statements made on an occasion of qualified privilege (as found by Her Ladyship) had been motivated by actual or express malice, much less, to conclude that the plaintiffs had proven there was malice behind those statements made by the defendants. To reemphasise, the conclusion of the trial court on this issue of 'malice' was therefore bereft of any valid basis. It was also evident from the grounds of the learned trial judge that there was no analysis or any deliberation at all as to any relevant fact or matters from which the court was to make or draw the inference of 'malice' as required, as against the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In our evaluation this was where the trial judge had fallen into error. Her Ladyship had not directed her mind to or applied the correct principles of law (both procedural and substantive), when, in this case, the court went on to hold that express 'malice' had been established to negate the defence of qualified privilege which had been ruled in favour of the defendants. The appellate court, as we were, was entitled to interfere with the decision of the trial court where, as shown above in our discussion, the trial court had misdirected itself and applied wrong principles of law in coming to its conclusion. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_104;"><i>Aseambankers Malaysia Berhad &amp; Ors v. Shencourt Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 104</LINK>; [2014] 2 CLJ 773). It was also trite that the parties were also bound to their filed pleadings and in this case the plaintiffs' pleadings, may it be the reply or the statement of claim, both were sorely lacking of particulars of facts and matters from which an inference of express malice was to be deduced by the court. This was no doubt sufficient to allow the appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> During the course of the further submission before us another question was also considered by us. This was as to whether in the light of developments in the law of defamation pertaining to defence open to newspapers or other media-related publications, based on what has come to be termed the '<i>Reynolds</i> Privilege', it was still necessary to consider or determine the issue of express 'malice' or whether it was relevant to still insist on the requirement that 'particulars as to facts and matters (from which the court was to make an inference of malice) had to be pleaded at all by the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> This variation of the 'classical' defence of qualified privilege traced its development and recognition to the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [2001] 2 AC 127 which derived its basis, as it would appear, from the duty owed by the press to the public at large to report and inform on matters of public concern or importance. <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> (11th edn) at para 14.2 has the following comment on this <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Lord Nichols in this <i>Reynold</i>'s case had set out a non-exhaustive 10-point list of circumstances to be considered in respect of this privilege in 'media' cases. The underlying basis of the <i>Reynolds</i> type of privilege has been often described as 'responsible journalism'. This principle was applied in the later House of Lords decision in <i>Jameel Mohamed v. Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl</i> [2006] UKHL 44, although it was opined there that the question of 'responsible journalism' should be approached in a more practical manner. In <i>Bonnick v. Morris</i> [2003] 1 AC 300, Lord Nicholls in the Privy Council stated that the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege was to provide a proper degree of protection for responsible journalism when reporting matters of public concern; responsible journalism was the point at which a fair balance is held between freedom of expression on matters of public concern and the reputation of individuals and for the benefit of this privilege journalists must exercise due professional skill and care.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The controversy has however lingered on whether the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege was a new substantive defence or merely a specie of defence under the conventional defence of qualified privilege. In <i>Grant v. Torstar</i> [2009] 3 SCR 640, the Supreme Court of Canada termed it a new defence of 'responsible communication' (<i>Reynolds</i> factors for analysis) and went on to observe that it produced an uneasy fit with the traditional qualified privilege defence. Lord Phillips MR (as he then was) in <i>Loutchansky v. Times Newspapers Ltd Corp</i> [2002] 1 All ER 652 commented that<i> Reynolds</i> Privilege was 'a different jurisprudential creature'; it is not the occasion which is protected but the material itself. Lord Hoffmann and Baroness Hale in <i>Jameel (supra)</i> took the position that 'responsible journalism' could not be assimilated to traditional qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The argument has been that 'responsible' or 'reasonable' journalism, whether as a new defence or otherwise, obviates any further enquiry into the issue whether the impugned statements were tainted with actual or express 'malice' when made. It is pertinent to note here that in the United Kingdom, by s 4 of the recently introduced Defamation Act 2013, the so called <i>Reynolds</i> common law defence has been abolished and replaced by a new 'public interest' defence (the Explanatory Notes to the Bill states that it was nevertheless to reflect the principles established in the <i>Reynold</i>'s case and subsequent case law). This statutory defence requires the publisher to show that he or she 'reasonably believed that publishing the statements complained of was in the public interest' (a shift, as it would appear, from tests of responsible journalism to reasonableness of belief).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The above discussion was to place in perspective the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege. The developments surrounding that area of law show that the '<i>Reynolds</i> Privilege' as a defence was always treated and recognised as a separate and distinct defence in contrast to the conventional common law defence of qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In the instant case before us however, the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege was not raised as a separate or even as a specie of the defence of qualified privilege; what was pleaded was the defence of qualified privilege <i>per se</i>. Both parties conducted the trial on that basis. Save that in their submissions the plaintiffs had made reference to the decision in <i>Reynolds</i>'s case to show that the writer or Harakah itself had a duty to verify the material published, both parties accepted that the principal defence of the defendants was the traditional common law defence of qualified privilege and the plaintiff had the obligation to establish express 'malice' to defeat that defence if found in favour of the plaintiffs. This was the position all along even in this appeal; see the supplementary submissions of both parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> It is also instructive to note that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;12.;;">s 12(1) of our Defamation Act 1957</LINK> states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The matters enumerated in Part I of the Schedule include fair and accurate report of proceedings of, international organisations and conferences, of public enquiries, and of legislatures and court proceedings outside Malaysia etc. If qualified privilege attached to such material can even be defeated by malice, what more with the matters that have been pleaded to be shielded under the usual defence of qualified privilege and so held by the court as in this case; that defence can only be defeated by express malice established against the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> It was also pertinent to point out that it was common knowledge that Harakah was a party organ of a political party which, no doubt, was available for purchase by the public at large. However what was also true was that it was not definitely in the nature of a daily newspaper with general public circulation in the likes of dailies like New Straits Time, The Star, etc. There was therefore serious doubts or issues as to whether the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege or defence (where contestably no malice need be established to defeat the defence of qualified privilege) would be relevant at all. As highlighted above this was not how the case was premised or proceeded at the court below and these issues were not canvassed or explored at the trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> Accordingly, it was our considered view for the reasons elaborated above, that the plaintiffs could not in any case, avail of (nor could this court volunteer) the benefit of some of the observations, as it would appear, in this area of law following the <i>Reynolds</i> decision or in the subsequent cases which had considered the <i>Reynolds</i> privilege, which arguably was to the effect of obviating or dispensing with the need for the court to consider any issue pertaining to express malice, much less, any issue as to whether there was sufficiently pleaded or not, particulars of fact or matters from which an inference of 'malice' was to be made, as was required under our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(3)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In conclusion therefore, as stated at para 47 above of this ground, this was a case where the learned trial judge had clearly misdirected herself and had failed to properly appreciate the relevant procedure or the law applicable in order to defeat or deny the qualified privilege that the court had found for the defendants in the first place. The conclusion of the trial judge that 'malice' had been proved was flawed and called for our interference. We therefore are constrained to allow the appeal of the defendants with costs. The appellants/ defendants are awarded a sum of RM15,000.00 as costs for this appeal and the deposit is to be refunded to the appellants/defendants.</p>
