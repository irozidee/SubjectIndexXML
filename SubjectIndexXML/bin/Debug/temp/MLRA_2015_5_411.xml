    <p>This appeal stemmed from the appellants' action against the respondent to declare the sub-lease the 1st appellant had with the respondent void. The respondent was the registered lessee of the premises it had sub-leased to the 1st appellant for 25 years under an agreement ('the agreement') dated 1 November 2006. The 2nd to 4th appellants were sureties for the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant terminated the sub-lease after discovering that the respondent failed to register it under the National Land Code ('NLC'). The discovery was made some two and a half years later after the execution of the agreement by which time the 1st appellant was already in occupation of the premises in question and paying rent. The 1st appellant had served the respondent with a notice of termination dated 13 May 2009 following the discovery and the respondent had thereafter presented the sub-lease for registration on 8 June 2009. The respondent counterclaimed that the termination was unlawful and for specific performance of the agreement. The respondent then applied for summary judgment against the appellants on the counterclaim. The High Court allowed the summary judgment and ordered damages in favour of the respondent. The High Court held that the sub-lease was void for non-registration but that a tenancy at will had been created. The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal and the respondent cross-appealed on that part of the High Court decision holding the sub-lease void for non-registration. The Court of Appeal allowed the cross-appeal, holding that there was a tenancy at will and that although the sub-lease was void for non-registration, it remained valid in equity as an agreement for a lease. The question before the Federal Court was whether a lease or sub-lease (exceeding three years) rendered void for want of registration under the NLC became a tenancy at will or an equitable sub-lease, and if so, for what period.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal in part):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The presentation for registration of the sub-lease on 8 June 2009 was done after the notice of termination dated 13 May 2009 was served on the respondent. As such, it could not be considered against the appellants. The validity of the notice should be judged on the facts as at 13 May 2009. On 13 May 2009, the 1st appellant had an agreement for a lease without any indication that the sub-lease would be registered and it was in those circumstances that the 1st appellant served the notice of termination. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The time for registration of the sub-lease was not specified in the agreement. <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;47.;;">Section 47 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> provided that where no time for performance was specified, the engagement must be performed within a reasonable time and reasonable time was, in each particular case, a question of fact. On 13 May 2009, the registration of the sub-lease was not performed within reasonable time, being two and a half years after the execution of the agreement. However, the 1st appellant was let into occupation long before the execution of the sub-lease. The 1st appellant had enjoyed a long and peaceful occupation of the demised premises. There were no issues between the parties over the sub-lease, notwithstanding the delay in registration of the sub-lease. The facts showed that the registration of the sub-lease was seemingly not required to be timeously performed. The delay in registration of the sub-lease was therefore not a fundamental breach that went to the root of the agreement. (paras 32 &amp; 48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the absence of fundamental breach by the respondent, the 1st appellant was not entitled to terminate the agreement. The notice of termination then amounted, even if unintended, to a repudiatory breach by the 1st appellant. Refusal to pay rent after June 2009 plus abandonment of the demised premises wholly substantiated that the 1st appellant had repudiated the agreement. That entitled the respondent to rescind the agreement and sue for damages. However, the respondent refused to accept the repudiation and instead elected to keep the sub-lease on foot. By keeping the agreement on foot, the respondent was not entitled to damages for loss of bargain, as acceptance of repudiation was an essential element in an action for damages for anticipatory breach. The respondent could not claim for both damages for anticipatory breach and for performance of executory obligations. (para 49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The 1st appellant and the respondent conducted themselves as bound by the terms of the unregistered sub-lease. As such, the relationship between them could not be determinable at the will of either of them. Their relationship was not, for it was beyond, a tenancy at will. Given that the 1st appellant expended substantial sums towards renovation of the said premises, and sub-let the said premises, all with the consent of the respondent, the circumstances were clearly such that equity could compel specific performance of the sub-lease which would be treated as if registered. However, the 1st appellant chose not to pursue a decree for specific performance. Instead, it was the respondent who sought to enforce the agreement. The interest of the respondent was solely financial. It was the 1st appellant as tenant that acquired the equity to protect its occupation. It would be unjust to turn the equitable lease for the full term against the 1st appellant to secure rent for the respondent proprietor. On balance, it would not seem that specific performance could be granted against the 1st appellant. (paras 50-51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The loss that the respondent suffered by reason of repudiation was the periodic tenancy. The courts had a great inclination to make every tenancy a holding from year to year. Whatever might be the position in equity, the appellant would be considered a tenant from year to year. Case laws dictated that the respondent was entitled to a six-month notice of termination of the year to year tenancy. A period of six months should also be reasonable time for the respondent to secure another tenant/s, as the premises in question were located in the city where landed properties were much sought after. But the notice of the 1st appellant was five months' short. (paras 53-54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> A lease or sub-lease (exceeding three years) was not rendered void by reason of non-registration. A lease or sub-lease (exceeding three years) was imperfect without registration. Unless perfected, it would not operate to transfer title to the lessee or sub-lessee. It was nonetheless an agreement for a lease. An agreement for a lease did not create a relationship of landlord and tenant. But if the tenant was let into possession under the imperfect lease or sub-lease, he became a tenant at will. A tenancy at will, was determinable at the will of either party, and being such it could not co-exist with a periodic tenancy or an equitable lease. When the tenant paid or expressly agreed to pay rent, the tenancy at will changed into a periodic tenancy upon the terms of the intended lease or sublease, that is, from year to year or for other periodic period, according to the computation of the rent. Where appropriate, equity might treat an agreement for lease as an equitable lease, that is, treat the unregistered lease as registered, and compel specific performance against the proprietor. (para 55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The sub-lease could not be specifically enforced against the 1st appellant for the rent for the full term. The respondent was only entitled to damages in lieu of notice of termination of the periodic tenancy. (para 56)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The sole question upon which leave was granted to appeal against the order of the Court of Appeal in respect of the matter decided by the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> By a sub-lease and Guarantee Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the agreement) dated 1 November 2006, the respondent, as the registered lessee, sub-leased certain floors of a seven storey building known as Wisma Fui Chiu and erected on land held under Geran 42414, Lot 130, Bandar Kuala Lumpur (hereinafter referred to as the demised premises) to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant for a term of 25 years, that is, from 1 May 2006 to 16 October 2031, with the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> appellants in tow as sureties for the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. Clause 6.0(a) of the agreement provided that the respondent shall execute and deliver to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant "a valid and registrable memorandum of [sub]lease in the prescribed form under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code</LINK> ... the quit rent receipt and all other documents including the issue document of title and the consent letter from the chargee or encumbrancer of the lease consenting to the memorandum of [sub]lease, for purposes of effecting the registration of the memorandum of [sub]lease within 14 days from the date of execution of this agreement". Clause 4.2 of the agreement provided that "for the purpose of determining the rent payable the lease period shall be divided into eight consecutive terms of three respectively and one final term ending 16 October 2031". The agreement permitted the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant to sublet, underlet or part with possession of the demised premises or any part thereof to third parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It was the finding of the Court of Appeal, though not of the High Court who was silent on the same, that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant paid the security deposit of RM2.1m and all rent due until [June] 2009, that on 14 December 2006, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant transmitted all documents and paid the registration fee to the respondent for the purpose of registration of the sub-lease, that on 20 March 2007, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant reminded the respondent to register the sub-lease, that on 1 August 2007, the respondent forwarded, purportedly, the official receipt for the payment of the registration fee for the sub-lease [on 1 August 2007, the respondent forwarded the receipt of a firm of solicitors - see p 348 of the Appeal Record], that on 6 May 2009, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant discovered that the respondent had not registered the sub-lease, that the non-registration of the sub-lease triggered the tenants of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, en masse, to terminate their respective tenancies with the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, principally on the ground that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was not the sub-lessee of the demised premises, and that on 13 May 2009, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant served notice of termination of the agreement on the ground of non-registration of the sub-lease (see paras 5 to 10, and 12 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Shortly thereafter, on 10 June 2009, the appellants filed [the instant] action against the respondent, which sought, <i>inter alia</i>, (i) a declaration that the sublease was void for non-registration, (ii) a declaration that the termination of the agreement and or of the tenancy at will was valid and binding, (iii) a declaration that the guarantees of the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> appellants were therefore void, and, (iv) general and special damages. On 26 June 2009, the respondent responded with a counterclaim, which sought, <i>inter alia</i>, (i) a declaration that the termination of the agreement was unlawful and or ineffective to terminate the sub-lease, (ii) a declaration that the sub-lease remained in force, (iii) a declaration that the appellants remained liable to perform the agreement, and, (iv) damages to be assessed. In its reply, the appellants pleaded that the sub-lease "was void for non-registration ... and that [the appellants had] lawfully terminated the tenancy at will" (see p 127 of the Appeal Record). And by defence to the counterclaim, the appellants pleaded that the failure to register the sub-lease was a fundamental breach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Meantime, on 8 June 2009, the respondent presented the sub-lease for registration. On 29 September 2009, the respondent applied for summary judgment against the appellants on the counterclaim. On 24 April 2010, the High Court entered summary judgment against the appellants on the counterclaim, and granted the declarations sought by the respondents, namely, (i) that the termination of the sub-lease was unlawful and ineffective, and (ii) that the sub-lease was still valid and binding on the appellants to perform. The High Court ordered damages in favour of the respondent to be assessed. The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal. The respondent cross-appealed, against that part of the decision of the High Court which held that the sublease was void for non-registration (see para 17 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Indeed, it was held by the High Court that by reason of non-registration "the lease is void and hence a relationship of tenancy at will is created" (see p 3 of the judgment of the High Court). The High Court did not expand on the "tenancy at will" that it said was created, but reasoned that "there was no fundamental breach ... there was no total failure of consideration" as there was a tenancy at will, and that the termination of the agreement was therefore invalid:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In the following paragraphs of its short judgment, the High Court referred to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1969_1_524;"><i>Lee Ah Low v. Cheong Lep Keen &amp; Anor</i> [1969] 1 MLRA 524</LINK>; [1970] 1 MLJ 7 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1972_1_528;"><i>Lee Lum Soh v. Low Ngah</i> [1972] 1 MLRH 528</LINK>; [1973] 1 MLJ 97, held that the said tenancy at will was "a tenancy from year to year" (see p 4 of the judgment of the High Court), and ordered damages in favour of the respondent to be assessed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> At the Court of Appeal, the respondent contended that pending the registration of the sub-lease, an equitable lease was in existence, while the appellants argued that whether it was in existence or not was a triable issue. "The parties did not dispute that there was a tenancy at will", but "the only dispute was whether it was a yearly or monthly tenancy at will" (see para 21 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal). The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that "the sub-lease was void for non-registration" (see para 23 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal) and that "the tenancy was a yearly tenancy" (see para 26 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal). Both courts below held that a tenancy at will came into existence when the sub-lease became void for non-registration. But both courts below had different notions of the tenancy at will. On the basis that there was a tenancy at will, the High Court reasoned that there was no total failure of consideration and that the termination of the agreement was therefore invalid. Whether right or wrong, that opinion of the High Court was at least clear. But with respect, the Court of Appeal was in two minds as to whether it was a 'tenancy at will' or 'equitable lease'. While it held that a tenancy at will was created, it also held that the agreement remained valid in equity as an agreement for lease. <i>Walsh v. Lonsdale</i> [1882] 21 Ch D 9, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1961_1_530;"><i>Margaret Chua v. Ho Swee Kiew &amp; Ors</i> [1961] 1 MLRA 530</LINK>; [1961] 1 MLJ 173, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1971_1_513;"><i>Yong Tong Hong v. Siew Soon Wah &amp; Ors</i> [1971] 1 MLRA 513</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 105 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1964_1_832;"><i>Lin Nyuk Chan v. Wong Sz Tsin</i> [1964] 1 MLRA 832</LINK> were all held out as authorities that supported the existence of an equitable lease (see para 23 of the grounds of the Court of Appeal). At the same time, it also held that the notice dated 13 May 2009 was a notice to terminate the agreement but not a notice to terminate a tenancy at will (see para 24 of the grounds of the Court of Appeal) and that the respondent could not be entirely faulted for the delay in registration of the sub-lease (see para 27 of the grounds of the Court of Appeal). The Court of Appeal also agreed with the High Court "that it was not the pleaded case of the appellants that the one-month notice to terminate was on the basis that the tenancy was a monthly tenancy at will" (see para 25 of the grounds of the Court of Appeal). For those reasons, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the appellants had not raised any triable issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Up to that point of its judgment, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the notice dated 13 May 2009 was ineffective to terminate the tenancy at will which remained in force. But in the ultimate paragraph of its judgment, the Court of Appeal held that "although the sub-lease was void for non-registration, it remained valid in equity as an agreement for a lease":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The cross-appeal by the respondent was against that part of the decision of the High Court which held that the sub-lease was void for non-registration. In allowing the cross-appeal, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the sublease, though void for non-registration, remained valid as an equitable lease. Hitherto, it was held that a tenancy at will was in existence, which begs the question as to whether a tenancy at will could co-exist with an equitable lease, which would be answered later in these grounds.</p>

      <b>[13]</b> A lease or sub-lease is granted by an instrument in Form 15A or Form 15B. In either case, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;206.;;">s 206(1)(b) of the NLC</LINK> provides that "no instrument effecting any such dealing shall operate to transfer the title to any alienated land or, as the case may be, to create, transfer or otherwise affect any interest therein, until it has been registered under Part Eighteen". "In my opinion, the language in that provision is sufficiently clear. It means what it says in that the very act of registration once effected necessarily passes the interest so registered. The whole Torrens system of land registration depends on this very principle and any derogation from it would cause the land title to be inconclusive. As Lord Wilberforce puts it: 'It would be destructive of the whole system of land registration' - See <i>Frazer v. Walker</i> [1967] AC 569" (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1986_2_575;"><i>Lian Keow Sdn Bhd (In Liquidation) &amp; Anor v. Overseas Credit Finance (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1986] 2 MLRH 575</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 56 per Yusoff Mohamed J, as he then was). A tenancy for a term not exceeding three years is exempt from registration (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;213.;;">s 213 of the NLC</LINK>). But a lease or sub-lease, which must be for a term exceeding three years, will not pass without registration. Without registration, would any other estate pass?</p>

Cheong Lep Keen &amp; Anor</i> [1969] 1 MLRA 524</LINK>; [1970] 1 MLJ 7, which in reality was the appeal against <i>Cheong Lep Keen &amp; Anor v. Tan Tin Kek</i>, the Federal Court per Ali FJ affirmed that the result that flows from entry upon a void lease is the same as from an entry upon an agreement for a lease:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Federal Court in <i>Lee Ah Low</i> categorically held that the said unregistered lease was void, and that the tenant, on his entry upon such void lease, becomes a tenant at will. But it should be noted that <i>Lee Ah Low</i> emanated from the State of Malacca, when the land registration system had yet not been converted from the registration of deeds to the registration of titles under the Torrens system. Under the Conveyancing and Law of Property Ordinance (Cap 118) then applicable to the states of Penang and Malacca, that is prior to the coming into force of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>, the execution of a formal conveyance acted to pass the legal estate of the vendor to the purchaser whilst the registration of a dealing acted merely as a public record of the transaction. The Straits Land Act 1839 provided for the registration of transactions (see Judith Sihombing, <i>National Land Code: A Commentary</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> edn at p 8). The Registration of Deeds Ordinance (Cap 121) continued the practice. The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> and the National Land Code (Penang &amp; Malacca Titles) Act 1963 came into force on 1 January 1966. Until then, "the law of the Settlements relating to land is fundamentally English law but modified by the Registration of Deeds Ordinance (Cap 121 of the revised edition of 1936) which provides that no instrument affecting land shall be admissible in evidence unless registered" (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1951_1_79;"><i>Yeap Lean Seng &amp; 4 Ors v. Kok Ho Teik &amp; Anor</i> [1951] 1 MLRA 79</LINK>, per Taylor J). Under s 5 of the Registration of Deeds Ordinance (Cap 121), all deeds affecting land "may be registered ... and unless and until so registered shall be inadmissible in any court as evidence of title to such land". Under s 53(1) of Cap 118, "a conveyance of any interest in land other than a lease for a period not exceeding three years at a rack rent shall be void at law unless it is by deed in the English language". The unregistered lease in <i>Lee Ah Low</i> was not in the English language. Hence, the unregistered lease in <i>Lee Ah Low</i> was inadmissible in any court of law as evidence of title (s 5 of Cap 121) and also void for not being in the English language (s 53(1) of Cap 118). It was void, but not because of non-registration under Cap 121.</p>

        <i>Margaret Chua v. Ho Swee Kiew &amp; Ors</i> [1961] 1 MLRA 530</LINK>; [1961] 1 MLJ 173 emanated from the State of Kedah, where the Torrens system was in place. The facts were as follows. On 22 December 1951, the appellant, who was the proprietor of two adjoining vacant shop lots in Alor Star town, borrowed $30,000 from the respondents, to build two shophouses thereon. The appellant agreed to lease certain portions of the completed buildings to the respondents for a period of 25 years. The appellant also agreed "not to sell or otherwise dispose of the demised premises or any part thereof, without first informing and granting the respondents the option to purchase the same at such price and upon such terms and conditions as shall be mutually agreed on". The agreement which purported to be an actual demise to take effect in future was executed in English, not in Jawi, as required by the Kedah Land Enactment. Thomson CJ (Hill and Good JJA concurred) held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Thomson CJ then set out the authorities that supported the view "that although the agreement might be a nullity as a lease it could be, and indeed was, a good enforceable agreement for a lease under which the appellant as registered proprietor had undertaken the obligation to grant a lease":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In <i>Margaret Chua</i>, the lease was incapable of registration as a lease. "It was, therefore, incapable of conferring upon the purported lessees any real interest in the land and so as a lease it was a nullity" (<i>Margaret Chua</i> per Thomson CJ). It was a nullity for being in the wrong language. In fact, both leases in <i>Lee Ah Low</i> and <i>Margaret Chua</i> were nullities for being in the wrong language. But with respect, that distinction was not appreciated in the following cases that cited and or purportedly followed <i>Lee Ah Low</i> and or <i>Margaret Chua</i>. To begin with, it was misread in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1971_1_513;"><i>Yong Tong Hong v. Siew Soon Wah &amp; Ors</i> [1971] 1 MLRA 513</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 105 that it was held in <i>Lee Ah Low</i> that the lease was void for non-registration:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1972_1_528;"><i>Lee Lum Soh v. Low Ngah</i> [1972] 1 MLRH 528</LINK>; [1973] 1 MLJ 97, it was held, "having regard to the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;221.;;">s 221</LINK> and to the definition of 'lease' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the National Land Code</LINK> and the principle enunciated in the case of <i>Lee Ah Low</i>", that the unregistered lease was "void as a lease for non-registration".</p>
    <p>[23] And in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_350;"><i>Tan Khien Toong &amp; Ors v. Hong Bee &amp; Co</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 350</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 387; [1987] CLJ 353, the tenants were let into possession of the whole of the ground floor of 171-D, Jalan Rahang, Seremban, at the monthly rental of $170.00 as from 1 April 1962 under an agreement which provided that "so long as the tenants shall pay the monthly rental of the demised premises punctually and promptly on the first day for every month and in any event not later than the fourteenth day of any month, and strictly adhere and abide by the terms and conditions contained herein, the tenants shall enjoy uninterrupted occupation of the demised premises, and the landlord shall not hinder, obstruct or determine the tenants' right to such enjoyment under any circumstances." After the death of the landlord, one Tan Kwan, the appellants became the registered co-owners of the shop premises and accepted the rent tendered by the respondents. As a result, the legal relationship of landlord and tenant was created between the parties. It was conceded that the written agreement of 31 March 1962 was never registered at the Land Registry office. The appellants claimed that the respondents were monthly tenants whose tenancy had been terminated. The crux of the defence of the respondents was that they, by reason of them having paid $9,000.00 as premium to the late Tan Kwan, were given a tenancy in terms of cl 7 and that they were induced by the late Tan Kwan to pay the money over in the expectation of being allowed to stay there indefinitely for so long as they paid the rental regularly. The High Court gave judgment in favour of the respondents. The question raised in the appeal was whether the High Court was right to apply the principle of equitable estoppel to the facts of the case, and whether the agreement was enforceable in equity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> George Seah SCJ held that the lease was void on the ground of nonregistration:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Hashim Yeop Sani SCJ, as he then was, held that what became evident from the undisputed facts, when the respondents failed to show that an equity had been created in their favour, was a monthly tenancy terminable with one month's notice.</p>

      <b>[27]</b> Practically all aforesaid cases also overlooked that the Statute of Frauds 1677 required every lease (exceeding three years) to be in writing. "In default of this, only a tenancy at will was created" (<i>Megarry &amp; Wade, The Law of Real Property</i>, 8<sup>th</sup> edn at para 17-036). "The Real Property Act 1845 required a deed in which the existing law required writing. The exception as to leases for three years or less therefore remain as before but all other leases had to be by deed. The Act provided that 'a lease required by law to be in writing ... shall be void at law unless also made by deed' " (<i>Megarry &amp; Wade, supra</i> at para 17-037). Those provisions continue to stand side by side in ss 52 and 54 of the Law of Property Act of 1925 (<i>Megarry &amp; Wade, supra</i> at para 17-038). Under English provisions, a lease which does not meet legal formalities is void.</p>

      <b>[28]</b> But the NLC does not say that an unregistered lease is void for nonregistration. "In fact, it even provides for the recognition of the operation of contractual transactions in so far as land dealings are concerned" (<i>Land Law in Malaysia, Cases and Commentary</i> by Teo Keang Sood and Khaw Lake Tee, 2<sup>nd</sup> edn at p 232). <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;206.;;">Section 206(1)(b) of the NLC</LINK> provides that "no instrument effecting any such dealing shall operate to transfer the title to any alienated land or, as the case may be, to create, transfer or otherwise affect any interest therein, until it has been registered under Part Eighteen". But <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;206.;;">s 206(3) of the NLC</LINK> provides that "nothing in subsection (1) shall affect the contractual operation of any transaction relating to alienated land or any interest therein".</p>

    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Clearly, all contractual obligations remained unaffected by nonregistration of the sub-lease. In the instant case, when the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant served notice of termination, already two and a half years had passed since execution of the agreement. But the sub-lease was still unregistered. When the appellants served notice of termination, the sub-lease had not even been presented for registration. It was subsequently presented for registration on 8 June 2009, that is, after the notice of termination. But as the presentation and registration of the sub-lease only transpired after the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had served notice of termination, they could not count against the appellants. Rather, the validity of the notice should be judged on the facts as known on 13 May 2009. First, it should be noted that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had possession of the demised premises even well before execution of the agreement (see cl 4.5 of the agreement). The previous contractual arrangement was not disclosed. But with execution of the agreement, on 1 May 2006, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant became, ostensibly, a sub-lessee with security of tenure of 25 years. The agreement provided for registration of the sub-lease. Pending registration of the sub-lease, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had an agreement for a lease. It would even have been generally assumed that the registration of the sub-lease was but a matter of course. But the sub-lease was not registered, not even after two and a half years had passed. On 13 May 2009, all that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had was an agreement for a lease and without any indication that the sub-lease would be registered. It was in those circumstances that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant served notice of termination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It was submitted that the time for registration of the sub-lease was not specified in the agreement. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;47.;;">Section 47 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> provides that "where, by the contract, a promisor is to perform his promise without application by the promisee, and no time for performance is specified, the engagement must be performed within a reasonable time" and that "what is a reasonable time is, in each particular case, a question of fact". Clause 6.0(a) of the agreement provided that the memorandum of sub-lease together with all other documents necessary to effectuate the registration of the sub-lease shall be executed and delivered "within 14 days from the execution of this agreement". On 14 December 2006, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant paid the registration fee. Given so, it should seem that the registration of sub-lease would have been urgent business to be completed as soon as possible. But it would not appear that any urgency was put to it. On 20 March 2007, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant reminded the respondent to register the sub-lease. Months later, the respondent responded by forwarding the receipt issued by a firm of solicitors. It was contended that the chargee's consent for the sub-lease contributed to the overall delay. That might be so. But that could not reasonably explain away the overall delay that extended into years. Reasonably, on 13 May 2009, it would only appear that the registration of the sub-lease had not been performed within reasonable time, which was a breach which occurred without any notice from the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant fixing a reasonable time for performance (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_636;"><i>Sime Hok Sdn Bhd v. Soh Poh Sheng</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 636</LINK>; [2013] 2 MLJ 149; [2013] 2 CLJ 615; [2013] 2 AMR 325). On the ground of non-registration of the sub-lease, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant served notice of termination to take effect on 1 July 2009. But was the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant entitled to terminate the agreement? The following decisions of the High Court of Australia are most instructive.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In <i>Progressive Mailing House Proprietary Limited v. Tabali Proprietary Limited</i> [1985] 57 ALR 609, the lessor, Tabali Pty Ltd, entered into a lease with the lessee, Progressive Mailing House Proprietary Limited, but the lease was not registered. The lessee entered into possession, but did not pay rent for the first two months and from May 1979 to October 1979, due to a dispute between the parties as to the completion of certain work to be carried out by the lessor. The lessor commenced proceedings against the lessee. The statement of claim accepted the lessee's repudiation and sought damages accordingly. Both parties agreed that the matter could be considered on the basis that the memorandum of lease was so registered. Lusher J held that the lessee was in breach of the covenants to pay rent and to maintain and repair and that the breaches had not been rectified. Lusher J, followed the majority decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Shevill v. Builders Licensing Board</i>, a decision which was later reversed (see [1982] 149 CLR 620), and concluded that, although a lessor could not recover rent after forfeiture, he could recover damages for loss of the benefit of the covenant to pay rent. On the assumption that a period of six months approximately would elapse before the lessor would succeed in reletting the premises, the lessee was ordered to pay the sum of $85,000 by way of damages in respect of the loss, as a consequence of re-entry, of the benefit of covenants contained in the memorandum of lease. An appeal from that decision, limited to the question whether Lusher J was correct in awarding damages, was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The sole question before the High Court was again whether Lusher J was correct in awarding damages.</p>

      <b>[34]</b> Mason J, as he then was, held that the ordinary principles of contract law, including that of termination for repudiation or fundamental breach, apply to leases, "thereby rejecting the traditional common law position that lease contracts are in a different category to other types of contracts" (<i>Australian Principles of Property Law</i> by Samathan Hepburn, 2<sup>nd</sup> edn at p 404):</p>

      <b>[35]</b> Mason J enunciated that mere breaches of covenant on the part of the lessee do not amount to a repudiation or fundamental breach and that it is essential to an award of damages for loss of bargain that the defendant can no longer be required to perform his contractual obligations <i>in specie</i>.</p>

      <b>[36]</b> Brennan J also enunciated on early determination, repudiation and said that a lessor can recover damages for loss of the benefit of a lease only where the lessee has repudiated the lease before determination of the term, and that the condition on which the lessee's liability in damages for repudiation arises is that he ceases to be liable to perform the executory obligations resting on him under the lease.</p>

      <b>[37]</b> In <i>Laurinda Pty Ltd and Ors v. Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd</i> [1989] 85 ALR 183, the lessor Capalaba was obliged to fill in certain details left blank in the memorandum of lease. This was never properly done by Capalaba, and the lease remained in an unregistrable form. Over a period of almost nine months since entering into possession, Laurinda made requests for the formalities to be complied with. Eventually, a letter demanding the receipt of a copy of the executed lease within 13 days was sent by Laurinda to Capalaba. Capalaba's solicitors gave a totally unresponsive reply and Laurinda purported to rescind the agreement for lease on the ground that Capalaba had repudiated the agreement or was in breach of essential conditions of that agreement as a result of Capalaba's failure to register the lease or to deliver a lease in registrable form. Capalaba treated Laurinda's rescission as wrongful repudiation of the agreement. On 3 October 1986, Capalaba re-entered the premises, Laurinda having ceased to pay rent in respect of the premises. On 31 October 1986, Laurinda commenced an action, <i>inter alia</i>, for a declaration that the lease had been validly determined on or about 5 September 1986, and for an order for the return of the sum of $2317, damages and interest. Laurinda claimed that it was a term that the lessor would grant and complete the lease by the date on which Laurinda opened Shop 79 for business and that Capalaba failed to comply with this term, that it was a term that the lessor would expeditiously procure the registration of the lease or, alternatively, procure registration of it within a reasonable time, and that the lessor had failed to comply with this term. By its defence, Capalaba disputed that the terms alleged by Laurinda were terms of the deed or of any agreement. And Capalaba denied that it was guilty of any unreasonable delay in completing the transaction. Capalaba contended that Laurinda's rescission was no more than wrongful repudiation, that Laurinda owed $3318.22 by way of unpaid rent from 1 September 1986, that this amount had not been paid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Connolly J found an express as well as an implied obligation to bring into existence a lease in registrable form within a reasonable time which had expired long before September 1986. Connolly J considered that the lessor's non-performance in this situation amounted to repudiation entitling the lessee to terminate the agreement. On appeal, Matthews, Carter and Dowsett JJ came to the conclusion that because the term on which the decision depended was a promissory condition, the lessees, as the parties requiring performance, were bound, in the circumstances of the case, to give an effective notice stating that in the event that the delay continued they would no longer be bound by the agreement, and that the letter of 21 August 1986 was not such a notice. In the result, the appeal was allowed, the declaration and orders made at the trial court were set aside and judgment was entered for such sums as might be assessed by the Master. At the High Court, it was common ground that the lessor was required to register the lease or, if not, to deliver a registrable lease to the lessee.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Significantly, in <i>Wood Factory Pty Ltd v. Kirotos Pty Ltd</i> [1985] NSWLR 105, it was held by Priestley JA, after His Honour's close study of the relevant law on a tenant's liability for rent and damages when a lease has come to an early end, that it is "important to recognise that Progressive Mailing is a decision which states clear principles of the law of leases which neither need for their authority, nor directly depend on, earlier case law ... Progressive Mailing is a clear root of title for the present and future law in Australia, behind which it will be unnecessary to go". And pertinent to repudiation and consequential damages, the principles of the law of leases, as enunciated in Progressive Mailing, were, (i) that the rights, duties and liabilities of the parties to a lease fall to be determined by reference to the ordinary principles of contract law, (ii) that mere breaches of covenant do not amount to a repudiation or fundamental breach, (iii) that repudiation is where a party evinces an intention no longer to be bound by the contract or to fulfil the contract only in a manner substantially inconsistent with his obligations and not in any other way, or where the party at fault is guilty of such default in performance that the breach goes so much to the root of the contract that it makes commercial performance of it impossible, (iv) that repudiation by anticipatory breach occurs if one party renounces his liabilities under it, if he evinces an intention no longer to be bound by the contract, or shows that he intends to fulfil the contract only in a manner substantially inconsistent with his obligations and not in any other way, (v) that repudiation or fundamental breach entitles the innocent party to rescind the contract and sue for damages for loss of the bargain, (vi) that it is essential to an award of damages for loss of bargain that the defendant can no longer be required to perform his contractual obligations in specie, (vii) that a lessor can recover damages for loss of the benefit of a lease only where the lessee has repudiated the lease before determination of the term, (viii) that in the case of anticipatory breach, the innocent party is entitled to accept the repudiation, thereby discharging himself from further performance, and sue for damages, (ix) that until the promisee accepts the repudiation, the rights and obligations arising from the partial execution of the contract and causes of action that accrue from its breach continue unaffected, (x) that the promisee's acceptance of the repudiation is an essential element in the cause of action for damages for anticipatory breach, (xi) that the promisee's acceptance of the repudiation is an essential element in the cause of action for damages for anticipatory breach, as the liability in damages is the substitute for the executory obligations to which acceptance of repudiation puts an end, and, (xii) that a waiver of forfeiture constitutes the lessor's election to keep the lease on foot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Repudiation, in the context of a lease, was further expounded in <i>Laurinda v. Capalaba</i>, where it was held, (i) that it is more than mere delay in the registration of the lease, but if delay remains unremedied for so long, it may constitute repudiation, (ii) that the right to repudiate will arise where a party repudiates an essential promise that is at the heart of the agreement, (iii) that where an essential term is to be performed within a reasonable time, there being no stipulated day for performance, and that time passes without performance, the innocent party does not acquire a right to rescind unless the defaulting party repudiates or has repudiated his obligation to perform, (iv) that to provide a firm foundation for the inference of repudiation, it is prudent for the promisee to give a notice to complete, (v) that the significance of the notice is twofold: primarily, it fixes a day when, if the default is not remedied, the party in default will be held to have repudiated the promise; and, secondarily, it will show that, for equity's purposes, it is fair for the innocent party to exercise the right of termination (see <i>Sime Hok v. Soh Poh Sheng</i>), (vi) that repudiation may be proved by other evidence and means without proof of an effective notice to complete.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The facts in the present appeal bear close resemblance to those in <i>Laurinda v. Capalaba</i>, right down even to the reliefs. But there were differences. Unlike <i>Laurinda v. Capalaba</i>, there was no finding in the instant case of repudiation by the lessor, and there was no notice by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant to the respondent to register the sub-lease within a fixed time. There was a reminder from the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, on 20 March 2007, to the respondent to register the sub-lease. But for the next two years, there was no enquiry whatsoever by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant on the matter of the registration of the sub-lease. Then out of the blue, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant terminated the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> As said, it was the finding of the High Court that the notice of termination was bad, on the ground that there was a tenancy at will, and that as such there was no total failure of consideration. It was also the finding of the Court of Appeal that the notice of termination was ineffective, but on the ground that it was a notice to terminate the agreement but not the tenancy at will. Suffice it to say there was no finding by the courts below that the delay in registration of the sub-lease amounted to repudiation of the agreement by the respondent. There would also be no such finding by us in the light of the following facts and circumstances. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was let into occupation long before execution of the sub-lease. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had enjoyed long and peaceful occupation of the demised premises. As far as one can tell, there were no issues between the parties over the sub-lease, notwithstanding the delay in registration of the sub-lease. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had not bothered to issue a notice fixing a reasonable time for the registration of the sub-lease, which should not be so if the registration of the sub-lease were in peril or in doubt. It would seem that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was complacent on the registration of the sub-lease, as the respondent had not evinced an intention no longer to be bound by the provisions of the agreement to register the sub-lease. Registration of the sublease was at the heart of the agreement. Outright repudiation of the covenant to register the sub-lease would entitle the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant to rescind. But on the facts, it would not seem that the registration of the sub-lease was required to be timeously performed. It would not appear that delay in registration of the sublease was a fundamental breach that went to the root of the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In the absence of fundamental breach by the respondent, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant was not entitled to terminate the agreement. Minus fundamental breach, the notice of termination amounted, even if unintended, to repudiatory breach by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. Refusal to pay rent after June 2009 plus abandonment of the demised premises wholly substantiated that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had repudiated the agreement (see <i>Copperart Pty Ltd v. Bayside Developments Pty Ltd</i> [1996] 16 WAR 396). That entitled the respondent to rescind the agreement and sue for damages. But that was not how it unravelled in the instant case. The respondent refused to accept repudiation of the agreement. Instead, the respondent elected to keep the sub-lease on foot. But by keeping the agreement on foot, the respondent was not entitled to damages for loss of bargain, as acceptance of repudiation was an essential element in an action for damages for anticipatory breach. "... it is only when the defendant ... has effectively renounced his contractual obligations that the plaintiff, if he accepts the position and brings the contract to an end, can be said to have thereby lost the benefit of the whole bargain and is entitled to loss of bargain damages" (<i>Morris v. Robert Jones Investments Ltd</i> [1994] 2 NZLR 275, 277 per Hardy Boys J). The respondent could not claim for both damages for anticipatory breach and for performance of executory obligations. But both were awarded by the courts below, which would have to be put right.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The finding by the courts below that it was a tenancy at will would also have to be put right. The 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had long been in occupation of the demised premises and paid the rent reserved which were accepted by the respondent. There was a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties that was apparently regulated, for both parties conducted themselves as so bound, by the terms of the unregistered sub-lease. "The essence [of a tenancy at will] is that it should be determinable at the will of either party ... " (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_349;"><i>Haji Taib v. Ismail</i> [1971] 1 MLRH 349</LINK> per Syed Agil Barakbah J, as he then was). Since it was regulated by the terms of the unregistered sub-lease, the relationship between the parties could not be determinable at the will of either the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant or respondent. Therefore, the relationship was not, for it was beyond, a tenancy at will (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1959_1_627;"><i>Saraswathy Ammal &amp; Anor v. Central Bank Of Malaya Ltd</i> [1959] 1 MLRH 627</LINK>; [1960] 1 MLJ 8, where the definition of 'tenancy at will' in Hill &amp; Redman, 10<sup>th</sup> edn, at pp 14 and 16, was cited). "In <i>York House Pty Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation</i> [1929-1930] 43 CLR 427 at 435-436, Knox CJ and Stark J observed that an unregistered agreement for lease is not void, and may confer equitable claims or interests and that, if a court of equity would compel specific performance of an agreement for a lease by the execution of a lease, the matter should be treated as if such a lease had been granted and was actually in existence" (<i>Re Oliver Brown Pty Ltd (No 2)</i> [2012] NSWSC 1222 per Black J). "Where there has been performance (and especially where a tenant has gone into possession under an agreement to lease) a court of equity will not usually refuse to decree specific performance ... " (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1964_1_832;"><i>Lin Nyuk Chan v. Wong Sz Tsin</i> [1964] 1 MLRA 832</LINK> per Wylie CJ (Borneo), delivering the judgment of the court). Now given further that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had expended substantial sums towards renovation of the demised premises, and sublet the demised premises, all that with the consent of the respondent, the circumstances were clearly such that equity could compel specific performance of the sub-lease which would be treated as if registered. The circumstances were clearly such that the sub-lease, although not registered in law, could be treated as a sublease in equity and could be enforced by the purchaser, by a decree of specific performance, against the proprietor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> But for whatever reasons, the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant chose not to pursue a decree for specific performance. Instead, it was the respondent who sought to enforce the agreement. While both courts below declared that the agreement was valid and binding on the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, the Court of Appeal went one step further in holding that there was an equitable lease, in the sense that the agreement must be specifically performed by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. <i>Hill and Redman's Guide to Landlord and Tenant Law</i> at para 2.63 observed "Upon the refusal or omission of either party to an agreement for a lease to perform the agreement on his part, the other is usually entitled to maintain an action for specific performance." But this principle of mutuality is no longer given the weight that it traditionally was (see <i>New Dennis Arther &amp; Anor v. Greesh Ghai Monty &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 3 SLR 908, at 914-915, per Choo Han Teck J who quoted the following from <i>Snell's Equity</i>, 32<sup>nd</sup> edn para 17-011: "In most cases, a monetary remedy of damages or an action for an agreed sum will be an adequate remedy for breach of contract for the payment of money ..."). The availability of specific performance generally of the covenants in an unregistered lease at the suit of the lessor is a matter of doubt (see <i>Chan v. Cresdon Pty Ltd</i> [1989] 168 CLR 242, at 255-256). Pertinently, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;11.;;">s 11(1)(c) of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> provides that "except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific performance of any contract may, in the discretion of the court, be enforced when the act agreed to be done is such that pecuniary compensation for its non-performance would not afford adequate relief" (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_101;"><i>Sekemas Sdn Bhd v. Lian Seng Co Sdn Bhd </i>[1989] 1 MLRA 101</LINK>; [1989] 2 MLJ 155; [1989] 1 CLJ 154). The interest of the respondent was solely financial. Besides, it was the tenant (1<sup>st</sup> appellant) who acquired the equity to protect his occupation. It would be unjust to turn the equitable lease for the full term against the tenant to secure rent for the proprietor (respondent). On balance, it would not seem that specific performance could be granted against the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. Rather, where there is an equitable lease, the rights of the proprietor are as per the lease, albeit unregistered. In <i>Walsh v. Lonsdale</i> [1882] 21 Ch D 9, Jessel, MR, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> "If the agreement can be specifically enforced, the landlord has the same rights as if a lease had been granted, and the tenant is protected in the same way as if a lease had been granted" (<i>York House Proprietary Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (supra)</i> at 436 per Knox CJ and Starke J). Upon the tenant's breach or default, the proprietor has the rights under the unregistered lease or sublease. Under cl 7.0 of the agreement, the respondent had the right to forfeit the sub-lease and to file action in respect of any antecedent breach. The respondent should seek out other tenant/s. The respondent should sue for damages in accordance with ordinary contractual principles, that is after due mitigation, to represent the loss of bargain and to substitute for the performance by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant. "Bearing in mind that the ordinary principles of contract apply, a useful starting point is the statement in <i>McGregor on Damages</i>, 15<sup>th</sup> edn, at para 29, where it said: 'the basic loss to the other party is the market value of the benefit of which he has been deprived though the breach. Put shortly, the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the loss of his bargain' " (<i>Nangus Pty Ltd v. Charles Donovan Pty Ltd</i> [1989] VR 184 per Kaye and Southwell JJ). "In contract, damages are awarded with the object of placing the plaintiff in the position in which he would have been had the contract been performed - he is entitled to damages for loss of bargain (expectation loss) ... " (<i>Gates v. City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd</i> [1985-1986] 160 CLR 1 at 11 per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ). "It was from this abandonment of the lease and repudiation of the contract that the damages naturally flowed" (<i>Hughes v. NLS Pty Ltd</i> [1966] WAR 100 per Jackson J). "... upon the repudiation of the agreement to lease, the acceptance thereof and the termination of the agreement, Bayside became entitled to damages for the breach of the agreement, assessed in the ordinary way by the ordinary contractual measure. The damages to be awarded are for the loss of the bargain: <i>Progressive Mailing House Proprietary Limited v. Tabali Proprietary Limited</i> [1985] 57 ALR 609. The measure of damages is taken to be the difference between the benefits in rental and outgoings (in this case) which Bayside would have received for the balance of the term, less any benefit of that kind which it has in fact received by re-letting the premises pursuant to its obligation to mitigate its loss, subject to a discount in an appropriate case (which is not this case) for the acceleration of the compensation obtained: <i>Hughes v. NLS Pty Ltd</i> [1966] WAR 100. It was upon that basis that the learned trial judge in this case proceeded to make in assessment of damages" (<i>Copperart (supra)</i> at 413 per Murray J).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The loss that the respondent suffered by reason of repudiation was the periodic tenancy. Both courts below held, but gave no reason why, that it was a tenancy from year to year. In Lee Ah Low, where the unregistered lease was for a term of 80 years, the Federal Court held that it was a yearly tenancy by reason of the equity in favour of the tenant by his going into possession. In <i>Tan Khien Toong &amp; Ors</i>, the Federal Court per Hashim Yeop Sani FCJ, as he then was, held that "Since the respondents here had failed to show that an equity had been created in their favour what becomes evident from the undisputed facts is a monthly tenancy terminable with one month's notice". In the instant case, as there was an equity in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, it could not be a tenancy from month to month. In any case, "the courts have a great inclination to make every tenancy a holding from year to year (<i>Richardson v. Langridge</i> [1984] 4 Taunt 128). "At an early stage of the history of tenancies from year to year a presumption arose in favour of that tenure ... This presumption has continued and still prevails ... it follows that at law, whatever may be the position in equity, the respondent would be considered a tenant from year to year" (<i>Moore v. Dimond</i> [1929] 43 CLR 105, pp 116-117 per Knox CJ, Rich and Dixon JJ).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> "At common law the tenancy from year to year was liable to termination by notice to quit before the term contracted for: <i>Moore v. Dimond</i>" (<i>Chan v. Cresdon</i> per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and McHugh JJ). "Where a tenancy is created by express agreement, the general rule at common law is that half a year's notice must be given expiring at the end of the first or some other year of the tenancy ... The same rule applies where a tenancy from year to year is implied by law from the payment and acceptance of rent, or from other circumstances, eg where a person entered under a void lease ... " (<i>Woodfall, Landlord and Tenant</i> vol 1 at para 17.206). A yearly tenant was entitled to six months' notice to quit at the end of the year (<i>Birch v. Wright</i> [1775-1802] All ER Rep 41 per Buller J). In <i>Mayo v. Joyce</i> [1920] 1 KB 824, it was held by Sankey J that the ordinary method of terminating a yearly tenancy was by a six months' notice expiring on the date of the commencement of the tenancy. In <i>Stokes v. Tracey (1)</i> [1920] 2 IR R 444, Sir James Campbell said it is "... an implied obligation on either party to terminate the tenancy by a definite period of notice, as in the case of a yearly tenancy, where either party could, in the absence of agreement, determine the tenancy by six months' notice... ". "For tenancies from year to year ... where parties have not expressly agreed on any period of notice, the law implies at least a half-year's notice expiring at the end of one completed year of the tenancy - <i>Sidebotham v. Holland</i> [1895] 1 QB 378. Once a valid notice is given, the tenancy automatically ends on the last day of the yearly period - <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1941_1_164;"><i>Yeo Chiang Swee v. G F Strickland</i> [1941] 1 MLRH 164</LINK>; [1946] 1 MLJ 7" (<i>Landlord and Tenant</i> by Lye Lin Heng at p 244-245). Accordingly, the respondent was entitled to six months' notice of termination of the periodic tenancy from year to year. A period of six months should also be reasonable time for the respondent to secure another tenant/s, as the demised premises are located right in the old city, where landed properties were and are much sought after. But the notice of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant which effectively terminated both agreement and periodic tenancy (see <i>Leitz Leeholme Stud Pty Ltd v. Robinson</i> [1977] 2 NSWLR 544, p 547 per Glass JA) was five-months short.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> We now answer the leave question as follows. A lease or sub-lease (exceeding three years) is not rendered void by reason of non-registration. A lease or sub-lease (exceeding three years) is imperfect without registration. Unless perfected, it will not operate to transfer title to the lessee or sub-lessee. It is nonetheless an agreement for a lease. An agreement for a lease does not create a relationship of landlord and tenant. But if the tenant is let into possession under the imperfect lease or sub-lease, he becomes a tenant at will (for further reading on the creation of a tenancy at will, see <i>Megarry &amp; Wade (supra)</i> at para 17-102). A tenancy at will, is determinable at the will of either party, and being such it cannot co-exist with a periodic tenancy or an equitable lease. When the tenant pays or expressly agrees to pay rent, the tenancy at will changes into a periodic tenancy upon the terms of the intended lease or sublease, that is, from year to year or for other periodic period, according to the computation of the rent. Where appropriate, equity may treat an agreement for lease as an equitable lease, that is, treat the unregistered lease as registered, and compel specific performance against the proprietor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The 'lease' which was acquired by the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant could not be specifically enforced against the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant for the rent for the full term. In the final analysis, the respondent was only entitled to damages <i>in lieu</i> of notice of termination of the periodic tenancy from year to year.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> For the above reasons, we (on 18 March 2015, Mohamed Apandi Ali FCJ, as he then was, now AG, agreed with the draft of this judgment) unanimously allow the appeal, but only in part. We vary the orders of the courts below to the effect and extent that we allow the application for summary judgment and order the appellants to only pay the sum of RM1.275m, it being the rent payable for the months of July 2009 to November 2009 <i>in lieu</i> of notice. The sum of RM1.275m is to be defrayed from the security deposit of RM2.1m, with the balance remaining to be refunded to the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, together with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from 1 December 2009 to date of refund. Finally, we order the rest of the claim of the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant to be dismissed, as the claim for renovation and other costs would not stand in the face of the summary judgment on the counterclaim.</p>
