      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent was the registered owner of a parcel of Malay Reservation land in Pahang ("the said land"). The respondent and her late husband operated a resort facility on the said land. In 2003, the appellants and the respondent entered into a "lease agreement" over a part of the said land ("the disputed land") for 40 years. In 2007, payments of the rental of the said land were returned to the appellants. A notice to the appellants to quit was issued by the respondent through her solicitors in 2008. When the appellants refused to quit and deliver vacant possession, the respondent commenced civil proceedings. The main issue was whether the "lease" between the parties contravened the Malay Reservation Enactment 1933 ("the Enactment"). The appellants submitted that: (i) the "lease agreement" did not amount to a dealing contrary to the provisions of the Enactment as it granted "only limited possessory/occupational rights"; (ii) the respondent was estopped from denying the appellants their limited possessory right (iii) the rooms/chalets of the resort operated by the respondent were let regularly to foreigners and local non- Malay guests, and if the agreement between the parties in the present case was deemed to be in breach of the provisions of the Enactment, the same would apply to the letting of rooms/chalets at the resort, resulting in Malay Reservation land being of very limited value to a Malay owner and (iii) the appellants were foreigners who were at the material time totally unaware and was not informed of the status of the disputed land as Malay Reservation land and the various prohibitions under the Enactment as well as its consequences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appellants' appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It is a basic principle of the English common law inherited here that ignorance of the law is not a defence or excuse be it for locals or foreigners, and of equity that the party seeking equity had done due diligence. In this case, the appellants' undoing was their doing. (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The submissions (put forward by the appellants) that the right to possession granted to the appellants was limited, not transferable, to be returned if the respondent should sell or transfer the land, the lease is not within the definition of lease in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the National Land Code</LINK>, disregard the fact that the appellants, by this appeal, were seeking to hold on to possession of the disputed property for the agreed term of 40 years. Notwithstanding whatever label used, the substance of the appellants' appeal remained that the appellants, who were non-Malays, seek to keep possession for their own use for 40 years the disputed land, which was part of a parcel of Malay Reservation land. (para 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> While s 8(1) of the Enactment provided that no memorandum of transfer, charge or lease in contravention of the section shall be capable of registration, the section prohibited any Malay holding not only from being transferred, charged, or leased but also from being otherwise disposed of to any person not being a Malay. And s 19(1) of the Enactment further provided that all dealings or disposals whatsoever and all attempts to deal in or dispose of any Malay holding contrary to the provisions of this Enactment shall be null and void ..." The terms "... or otherwise disposed of ..." and "... all attempts to deal in or dispose ..." extended the prohibition beyond transfers, charges and leases, and therefore prohibited and rendered null and void leases not capable of registration. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Leasing out of a possessory right for 40 years effectively placed the disputed land in non-Malay hands for that period, while the terms of rental of chalets and rooms for guests, Malays as well as non-Malays for short terms, maintained the resort in Malay hands. In the circumstances, the application of the Enactment was clear and no doctrine of equity may stand against it (<i>Robert Lee &amp; Anor v. Wong Ah Yap &amp; Anor (refd)</i>). (para 20)</p>

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants/defendants Derek Victor Cawton and Patricia Berangere Cawton-Graf ("the appellants") who are a British and Swiss couple, appealed against part of the decision of the High Court at Kuantan after a full trial, which allowed the respondent/plaintiff's ("the respondent") claim as prayed for in the statement of claim except for para 10(iv) therein. There is no appeal by the respondent against the grant of an order of restitution as set out in the amended statement of defence and counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent is the registered owner of a parcel of Malay Reservation land known as HS (M) 2804 PT 9012, Mukim Penor, Daerah Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur ("the said land"). The respondent and her late husband Jack Choo @ Fariq Choo operated a resort facility on the said land. A part of the said land ("the disputed land") is the subject matter of the litigation and the appeal between the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Sometime in 2003, the appellants and the respondent entered into a "lease agreement" over the disputed land, comprising an 11,000 sq feet portion of the said land commencing 1 March 2003 for 40 years until 1 March 2042, with rental initially at RM2,500.00 per annum for the first five years, increasing every five years and ending with rental at RM7,200.00 per annum for the final five years period ending on 1 March 2042.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The said Jack Choo having died sometime in May 2005, the respondent married one Anthony Syddall.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> A cheque in payment of the rental for 1 March 2007 to 1 March 2008 by the appellants was returned by the said Anthony Syddall sometime in June 2007. A fresh cheque issued subsequently was also returned. A notice to the appellants to quit was issued by the respondent through her solicitors in 2008. When the appellants refused to quit and deliver vacant possession, the respondent commenced civil proceedings. The appellants filed a defence and a counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The main issue is whether the "lease" between the parties contravened the Malay Reservation Enactment 1933 (Cap 142)("the Enactment").</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Submission For The Appellants</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It was submitted for the appellants that the "lease agreement" did not amount to a dealing contrary to the provisions of the Enactment as it granted "only limited possessory/occupational rights". In support, it was submitted that possession "will ultimately return to the respondent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement" and it is stipulated that the respondent is at liberty to deal with the disputed land at any time by selling the same, in which event, the appellants must return possession to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Relying on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1935_1_506;"><i>Idris Bin Haji Mohamed Amin v. Ng Ah Siew</i> [1935] 1 MLRH 506</LINK>; [1935] MLJ 257 that the obvious intention of the Enactment was to secure land comprised in Malay Reservations for Malays only and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1980_1_576;"><i>Bariam Singh v. Pegawai Pentadbir Pesaka Malaysia (Administrator Of Estate Of Datuk Foo Say Lee)</i> [1980] 1 MLRH 576</LINK>; [1983] 1 MLJ 232 that the aim of the law is that the land should not fall into the hands of a non-Malay ...", and that since by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> the courts should favour a purposive approach (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_116;"><i>DYTM Tengku Idris Shah Ibni Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah v. Dikim Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 116</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 11; [2002] 2 CLJ 57; [2002] 2 AMR 1503), it was submitted that the High Court erred in relying on the form or label of the agreement hand drafted by a layman Jack Choo, for if the agreement is scrutinised, the numerous restrictions imposed on the appellants demonstrate that the agreement does not grant any interest in the title to the land in question, but merely affords the appellants a limited personal occupational right to a portion of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Counsel referred to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_472;"><i>Robert Lee &amp; Anor v. Wong Ah Yap &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 472</LINK>; [2007] 4 MLJ 393; [2007] 4 CLJ 1 and submitted in that case the Federal Court held that the Malay Reservations Enactment was created with "a definitive objective", and went on to state that "no rules of equity shall be applied that would defeat such objective" but the agreement between the parties in the present case, as described above, does not defeat that objective.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It was further submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Counsel quoted <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_738;"><i>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 738</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 331; [1995] 4 CLJ 283; [1995] 3 AMR 2871 that "The time has come for this court to recognise that the doctrine of estoppel is a flexible principle by which justice is done according to the circumstances of the case. Estoppel is a doctrine of wide utility and could be resorted to in varying fact patterns to achieve justice. Indeed the circumstances in which the doctrine may operate are endless."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The submission proceeded on to <i>WJ Alan &amp; Co Ltd v. EL Nasr Export &amp; Import Co</i> [1972] 2 QB 189 that "If one party by his conduct, leads another to believe that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be insisted upon, intending that the other should act on that belief, and he does act on it, then the first party will not afterwards be allowed to insist on strict legal rights when it would be inequitable for him to do so".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was submitted that the respondent be estopped from denying the appellants their limited possessory right.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> To complete the submissions, it was submitted that the appellants are foreigners who were at the material time totally unaware and was not informed of the status of the disputed land as Malay Reservation land and the various prohibitions under the Enactment as well as its consequences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reasoning And Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is a basic principle of the English common law inherited here that ignorance of the law is not a defence or excuse be it for locals or foreigners, and of equity that the party seeking equity had done due diligence. In this case, the appellants' undoing is their doing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Section 8(1) of the Enactment provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the light of the very clear prohibition, reliance upon <i>WJ Alan &amp; Co Ltd v. EL Nasr Export &amp; Import Co (supra)</i> is misplaced because the restriction affecting the appellants is by the Malay Reservations Enactment, statute law applicable to all and whereas this case concerns the legal rights <i>inter se</i> between the parties. We also cautioned ourselves that the words "The time has come ..." in <i>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad (supra)</i> cannot possibly mean that the court can legislate or make law contradicting statute law, or that the equitable doctrine of estoppel can be applied at will. That would lead to anarchy. The doctrine of estoppel is limited to achieving justice according to law. Indeed in <i>Robert Lee &amp; Anor v. Wong Ah Yap &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, the Federal Court had made it abundantly clear that no rule of equity is to be allowed to stand in the face of the objective of statute law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Ample precedent, such as <i>Idris Bin Haji Mohamed Amin v. Ng Ah Siew (supra)</i> and <i>Bariam Singh v. Pegawai Pentadbir Pesaka Malaysia (Administrator Of Estate Of Datuk Foo Say Lee) (supra)</i> cited in respect of the purpose of the Malay Reservations Enactment, speak of the intention of the Enactment to ensure that lands in Malay Reservations remain for Malays, and not fall in the hands of non-Malays. The submissions that the right to possession granted to the appellants was limited, not transferable, to be returned if the respondent should sell or transfer the land, the lease is not within the definition of lease in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the National Land Code</LINK>, disregard the fact that the appellants, by this appeal, are seeking to hold on to possession of the disputed property for the agreed term of 40 years from 1 March 2003. Notwithstanding whatever label used, the substance of the appellants' appeal remains that the appellants, who are non-Malays, seek to keep possession for their own use for 40 years the disputed land, which is part of a parcel of Malay Reservation land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We observe that while s 8(1) of the Enactment provides that no memorandum of transfer, charge or lease in contravention of this section shall be capable of registration, the section prohibits any Malay holding not only from being transferred, charged, or leased but also from being otherwise disposed of to any person not being a Malay. And s 19(1) of the Enactment further provides that all dealings or disposals whatsoever and all attempts to deal in or dispose of any Malay holding contrary to the provisions of this Enactment shall be null and void ..." The terms "... or otherwise disposed of ..." and "... all attempts to deal in or dispose ..." extend the prohibition beyond transfers, charges and leases, and therefore prohibits and renders null and void leases not capable of registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The further argument that if the agreement between the appellants and the respondent is held to be in breach of the Enactment, then the renting out of chalets and rooms in the resort portion of the respondent's land to foreigners and local non-Malays would also be in breach wholly overlooks the fact that the chalets and rooms are rented out on daily and short term basis, whilst the appellants seek to maintain a possessory right for 40 years from 1 March 2003. Leasing out of a possessory right for 40 years effectively places the disputed land in non-Malay hands for that period, while the terms of rental of chalets and rooms for guests, Malays as well as non-Malays for short terms, maintains the resort in Malay hands. In the circumstances, the application of the Enactment is clear and, following <i>Robert Lee &amp; Anor v. Wong Ah Yap &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, no doctrine of equity may stand against it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in the appeal. We dismiss the appeal with costs in the sum of RM10,000.00 as agreed to be paid to the respondent, and deposit to respondent to account of costs as agreed by parties.</p>
