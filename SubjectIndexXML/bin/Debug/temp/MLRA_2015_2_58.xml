    <p>The appellants were residents of SS19, Subang Jaya, Selangor. Sometime in 2004, the appellants became aware of construction and clearance works ("the works") by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents along certain roads in SS19. The works resulted in the removal of trees and landscaping along the roads and diminished amenities such as footpaths and parking spaces for vehicles. The appellants contended that as a result, they lost the comforts and amenities that they had grown accustomed to as residents of SS19. The appellants claimed the respondents failed to give them any notice or provide any reason for the said works. The appellants further claimed that on 22 March 2004, the 1st respondent had authorised the other respondents to commence the works and on 22 April 2004 and 26 May 2004, the 1st respondent issued permits to the other respondents for the works. The appellants claimed <i>inter alia</i>, that the 1st respondent had acted illegally and in breach of its statutory duty to consult the appellants in respect of the works pursuant to provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">Town and Country Planning Act 1976 ("the Act")</LINK>. The appellants thus sought leave to commence judicial review proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 2 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> for declaratory and injunctive reliefs and damages against the respondents. The High Court dismissed the application on the sole ground that the appellants had failed to identify the decision to be impugned. The appellants appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Based on the materials adduced by the appellants, there were arguable issues and the application was not frivolous. This was a case for further consideration. There were matters which ought to be fully argued in the substantive review hearing. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The 1st respondent's counsel's reliance on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;36.;;">s 36 of the Act</LINK> as providing a remedy of appeal for the appellants was misconceived. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;36.;;">Section 36 of the Act</LINK> merely provides for the constitution and powers of the Appeal Board. (paras 22-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellants were challenging the decision made by the 1st respondent on 22 March 2004 authorising the other respondents to commence the works. The appellants were also challenging the decision made by the 1st respondent to issue permits for the works to the other respondents. The High Court judge had therefore erred in finding that the appellants had failed to identify the decision to be impugned. (para 24)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aziah Ali JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants, (the applicants in the court below) had filed an application dated 24 December 2004 for leave to commence judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 2 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> (as it was known then) for the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The learned judge dismissed the application on the sole ground that the appellants had failed to identify the decision to be impugned. The appellants are dissatisfied with the decision of the learned judge, hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appeal against the 3rd and 4th respondents had been withdrawn. This appeal is therefore in respect of the 1st and 2nd respondents only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Before us, the learned counsel for the appellants, Mr Alex De Silva acknowledged that some of the reliefs prayed for in the application may no longer be available due to events that have taken place since this application was filed. Hence learned counsel confined the application to reliefs prayed for in para 1(b), 1(d) and 1(e) only and in paras 4, 5 and 6 of the application. It was submitted that the appellants still wished to pursue the relief of damages against the respondents which learned counsel submitted is a remedy available in judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> An issue that arose early in this appeal was whether, arising from the appellants' abandoning the reliefs prayed for in paras 1(a) and 1(c), this action ought to be converted to a writ action. Both learned counsel for the respondents raised their objections. In his submissions before us, the learned counsel for the appellants indicated to us that no order need be made on this issue. Thus the only issue for our determination is whether leave ought to be granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Having heard the parties, we allowed the appeal and granted the reliefs prayed for in paras 1(b), 1(d), 1(e), 4, 5 and 6. We now give our reasons below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Salient Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> For the purpose of this judgment we set out the salient facts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In the appellants' grounds for the application, it is stated that the appellants are residents of SS 19, Subang Jaya, Selangor. The houses in SS 19 are adjacent to Persiaran Tujuan. Persiaran Tujuan is a main road connecting Subang Jaya to the Federal Highway and runs perpendicular to Jalan Subang Utama, another main road in Subang Jaya. Both these roads ("the roads") are main residential routes and provide access from SS 19 with SS 12, SS 13, SS 14, SS 15, SS 16, SS 17 and SS 18, Subang Jaya. Access from SS 19 to Persiaran Tujuan is via a service road known as Jalan SS 19/2 which runs parallel to Persiaran Tujuan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Some time in early July 2004, the appellants became aware of construction works and clearance works ("the works") along the roads known as Persiaran Tujuan and Jalan Subang Utama conducted by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents. According to the appellants, the works resulted in the removal of trees and landscaping which had previously lined the roads and had resulted in diminishing the amenities such as footpaths and parking spaces for vehicles. The works had also encroached the service road that runs parallel to the roads. As a result, the appellants say that they have lost the comforts and amenities that they have grown accustomed to as residents of SS 19.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellants say that neither the 1st, 2nd, 3rd nor the 4th respondent gave notice to them or provided any reason in respect of the said works. The appellants state that no survey report whatsoever in respect of environmental impact, noise impact, traffic impact and compatibility of the works to the residential environment was provided and/or made available by the respondents to the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The 1st appellant, Mohamad Ilyan bin Yahya states in his affidavit that at a meeting on 14 September 2004 held between the 1st respondent and members of a Pro-tem Committee formed by the residents of SS 19 which was chaired by the Yang Di Pertua of the 1st respondent, it was made known that the 1st respondent had given approval to commence the works to the 2nd respondent and that the 1st respondent had ceded authorisation over the approval of the works to the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellants state that based on a chronology of events prepared and provided by the 1st respondent to the 1st appellant, it is shown that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Essentially the appellants contend that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It is therefore contended that the decisions of the 1st respondent giving approval and/or issuing permits to the 2nd and/or the 3rd and/or the 4th respondent to commence and conduct the works were irrational and/or unreasonable and/or did not take into relevant considerations and/or were in breach of statutory duties and/or in breach of procedural fairness and/or in breach of natural justice and are therefore a nullity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned counsel for the 1st respondent, Mr Adrian Oswald submits that the decision to construct the flyover, an underpass and an interchange was not made by the 1st respondent. The decision-maker is the Federal Government. It is submitted that on 22 April 2004 and 26 May 2004 the 1st respondent merely issued the 'Permit Pengorekan Jalan' pursuant to its power under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974</LINK>, on the application made by the 3rd respondent, for the purpose of supervising the works carried out by the 3rd respondent and not for the purposes of constructing an interchange, a flyover and an underpass along, around and at Persiaran Tujuan, Subang Jaya and Jalan Subang Utama. The 1st respondent had also denied issuing the 'Surat kebenaran bagi memiliki dan memulakan kerja di tapak kepada NPE'. It is the contention of the 1st respondent that the appellants have failed to show an arguable case for review because the appellants have not identified the person or entity who had supposedly issued the 'Surat kebenaran bagi memiliki dan memulakan kerja di tapak kepada NPE' and the appellants have also failed to show whether the permits dated 22 April 2004 and 26 May 2004 were issued for the purpose of constructing a flyover, an underpass and an interchange along Jalan Subang Utama and the access road from SS 19 to Persiaran Tujuan. It was submitted that the appellants had failed to disclose sufficient materials in their affidavits to persuade the court to grant leave. Learned counsel submits that the appellants had failed to satisfy the threshold test for leave to commence judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Learned counsel had further submitted that the appellants had failed to exercise their right to appeal accorded by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;36.;;">s 36 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> For the 2nd respondent, the learned counsel Mr Ramesh Sanghvi confined his submissions to only one issue, ie although the 2nd respondent may be necessary parties, the 2nd respondent was not the decision-maker in respect of the works nor for the construction of the flyover, the interchange and the underpass, and that the 2nd respondent was not involved in the decisions made by the 1st respondent. Hence learned counsel raised the issue of whether, in respect of the 2nd respondent, there is any decision that is subject to judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Having considered the application and the submissions made, we find that there are clearly various facts and issues in dispute. The appellants contend that the 1st respondent had breached its statutory duties under the Act when on 22 March 2004 the 1st respondent had authorised the 2nd and/or the 3rd and/or the 4th respondent to commence the works and on 22 April 2004 and 26 May 2004 had issued to the 2nd and/or the 3rd and/or the 4th respondent permits for the works. The 1st respondent on the other hand contend that they did not make the decision for the construction of the flyover, the interchange and the underpass and had denied issuing the 'Surat kebenaran bagi memiliki dan memulakan kerja di tapak' to the 3rd respondent. The 2nd respondent denied any involvement in the decisions made by the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_536;"><i>Tuan Sarip Hamid &amp; Anor v. Patco Malaysia Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 536</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 442; [1995] 3 CLJ 627, the Supreme Court referred to the English Court of Appeal case of <i>R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Rukshanda Begum</i> [1990] Crown Office Digest 109, Dip, wherein the guidelines to be followed by the court in considering an application for leave have been laid down as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_698;"><i>Tang Kwor Ham &amp; Ors v. Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2005] 2 MLRA 698</LINK>; [2006] 5 MLJ 60; [2006] 1 CLJ 927; [2002] 3 AMR 2686 this court said <i>inter alia</i> that at the leave stage, the court ought not to go into the merits of the case. Its role is only to see if the application for leave is frivolous. The discretion that the court is exercising at this stage is not the same as that which it is called upon to exercise when all the evidence is in and the matter has been fully argued at the hearing of the application. (Lord Diplock in <i>Inland Revenue Commissioners v. National Federation of Self-employed &amp; Small Businesses Ltd</i> [1982] AC 617).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We are satisfied that, based on the materials adduced by the appellants, there are arguable issues and the application is not frivolous. In our opinion, this is a case that is fit for further consideration. We find that there are matters which ought to be fully argued in the substantive review hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The learned counsel for the 1st respondent has also raised the issue of the availability of the remedy of appeal under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;36.;;">s 36 of the Act</LINK>. It is contended that the appellants have a right to appeal to the Appeal Board against the alleged decision of the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We have perused the Act and we find that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;36.;;">s 36</LINK> merely provides for the constitution and powers of the Appeal Board. The right of appeal is found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;23.;;">s 23</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;35C.;;">s 35C</LINK>. However, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;23.;;">s 23</LINK> provides for appeal to the Appeal Board by an applicant who is aggrieved against the decision of the local planning authority made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;22.;;">s 22(3)</LINK> refusing planning permission or by any condition imposed by the local planning authority in granting planning permission, and by a person who is aggrieved by the decision of the local planning authority in relation to an objection lodged pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;21.;;">s 21(6) of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;35C.;;">Section 35C</LINK> provides for an appeal to the Appeal Board by any person who is aggrieved by a tree preservation order, any of the provisions of a tree preservation order, or the refusal of a written permission or any of the conditions imposed on a grant of a written permission or an order to plant or replace trees. Therefore these two provisions do not apply to the instant case. Hence learned counsel's reliance on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;36.;;">s 36</LINK> is misconceived.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> With respect to the decision of the learned judge who had dismissed the appellants' application on the ground that the appellants had failed to identify the decision to be impugned, we find that from the affidavits filed by the appellants, it is clear that the appellants are challenging the decision made by the 1st respondent on 22 March 2004 authorising the 2nd and/or the 3rd and/ or the 4th respondent to commence the works and in so doing, the appellants contend that the 1st respondent had not conformed to the requirements under the Act. A similar challenge is mounted on the decision by the 1st respondent to issue permits for the works to the respondents. We therefore are of the view that the learned judge has erred in finding that the appellants had failed to identify the decision to be impugned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> For the reasons stated above, we allowed the appeal with costs in the cause at RM10,000.00.</p>
