    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his conviction and sentence for the offence of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. At the material time, both the appellant and the deceased were prisoners in Kajang prison. Following a complaint from the deceased that he was in pain, the deceased was brought to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead. The post-mortem confirmed that the cause of death was "traumatic asphyxia". The appellant was arrested for murder and had admitted to kicking the deceased; however, he denied that he had caused the death of the deceased and stated that the deceased had been beaten up by other inmates prior to his death. At the end of the trial, the trial judge found that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out against the appellant and convicted and sentenced the appellant accordingly. In this appeal, the appellant contended that the prosecution failed to prove that the appellant possessed sufficient knowledge that his act, in all probability had caused the death of the deceased or such bodily injury as was likely to cause death within limb (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>; and that the trial judge failed to properly evaluate the evidence of SP7 and SP9 who were accomplices. Accordingly, the main issues to be decided were, inter alia, whether the appellant knew that the act he was committing was so imminently dangerous and that death would result from such an act; whether the evidence of SP7 and SP9 relied on by the trial judge was credible; whether the prosecution had established a <i>prima facie</i> case; and whether the appellant could be found guilty of the lesser offence of culpable homicide.</p>
    <p>Held:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The evidence in this case showed that the prosecution failed to prove that the appellant knew that his act of kicking the deceased was so imminently dangerous that it would in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as was likely to cause death. Even if the prosecution had succeeded in proving that the appellant had kicked the deceased, it was still doubtful that the appellant alone, had inflicted the severe and multiple broken ribs on the deceased which culminated in his death due to "traumatic asphyxia." Therefore, on the available evidence, the appellant's act of kicking the deceased was insufficient to fasten knowledge that the appellant knew that his act in all probability would cause death. (paras 10-12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Both SP7 and SP9 might have had a purpose of their own to serve or to exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing. Hence, their testimonies ought to be treated with caution and therefore corroboration was required, if their evidence was to be acted upon. In this instance, the evidence of SP7 and SP9 appeared to have contradicted the evidence of the prison warden, SD2, on material issues and as such their veracity and truthfulness were questionable. (paras 16 &amp; 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The substantive cause of the deceased's death was 'traumatic asphyxia'. However, there was no evidence to show that the acts of the appellant had in any way accelerated the deceased's death. Accordingly, the appellant was not totally blameworthy and the death of the deceased could not be attributed to the appellant alone. In light of that, the prosecution failed to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. Nonetheless, there was sufficient evidence for an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK> against the appellant.

      <b>Zamani A Rahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged and tried before the High Court at Shah Alam for an offence of murder of Lui Hoh Hiong under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The charge reads as follows:</p>

      <b>Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant gave evidence on oath and he called a Prison Warden, Dzul bin Mondar (SD2) in support of his defence. The defence may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Learned counsel canvassed two issues before us. The first issue was that the prosecution has failed to prove that the appellant possessed sufficient knowledge that his act, in all probability would cause death of the deceased or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death within limb (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300</LINK>. The second issue relates to the trial judge's failure to evaluate the evidence of Ng Lea Chong, (SP7) and Dorajasingam a/l Tabiraja, (SP9) as they were accomplices.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Having heard the appeal, we found that there were merits in the grounds raised by the appellant. We therefore unanimously allowed the appeal and we set aside the conviction of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK> by the High Court. However, we found that there was sufficient evidence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>. We therefore convicted and sentenced the appellant to 20 years' imprisonment with effect from 9 September 2014. We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The prosecution is relying on the proviso (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>. For this provision to apply the appellant must know that the act he is committing is so imminently dangerous and nonetheless commit it in utter disregard that death would result from such act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_3_42;"><i>PP v. Mahfar Sairan</i> [2000] 3 MLRH 42</LINK>; [2000] 4 MLJ 791; [2000] 7 CLJ 600; [2000] 4 AMR 4913, the court cited with approval Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal Law of Crimes (24th edn) at p 1297, which states that proviso (d) contemplates the doing of an imminently dangerous act to people in general and not the doing of any act to any particular individual. The illustration (d) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300</LINK> (of firing a loaded canon into a crowd) serves to illustrate the point).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> However, the proviso (d) could also be interpreted to include the doing of an act to an individual alone. In the instant case, the prosecution must prove that the appellant knew that his act, in the manner in which he did it, was so imminently dangerous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The evidence showed that the prosecution has failed to prove that the appellant knew that his act of kicking the deceased was so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Even if the prosecution had succeeded in proving that the appellant had kicked the deceased, it is still doubtful that the appellant alone and he alone, had inflicted the severe and multiple broken ribs on the deceased which culminated in his death due to "traumatic asphyxia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On the available evidence, the appellant's act of kicking the deceased is insufficient to fasten knowledge that the appellant knew that his act in all probability would cause death. In Mahfar Sairan's case, supra, the court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The Consultant Pathologist, SP6 said that the cause of "traumatic asphyxia" is due to compressed ribs which might have resulted from heavy objects having been placed on the deceased's chest, though he did not rule out that repeated stomping might have resulted in the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The second issue relates to the credibility of the evidence of Ng Lea Chong, (SP7) and Dorajasingam a/l Tabiraja, (SP9). The prosecution had relied on these two eye witnesses, SP7 and SP9 to bring home the charge of murder against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The prosecution submitted that SP7 and SP9 were in the cell - the scene of the assault. They witnessed that the deceased was assaulted by the appellant. However they said that they did not participate in the beating of the deceased. Learned Deputy Public Prosecutor argued that the evidence of SP7 and SP9 were entitled to credence and they were not accomplices; see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_441;"><i>Sabarudin Non v. PP &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 441</LINK>; [2005] 4 MLJ 37; [2005] 1 CLJ 466; [2005] 1 AMR 4 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_457;"><i>Kuan Ted Fatt v. PP</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 457</LINK>; [1985] 1 MLJ 211; [1985] CLJ 174.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Learned counsel, however, contended that SP7 and SP9 were accomplices. With respect, we are unable to agree. Both SP7 and SP9 claimed that they were not involved in attacking the deceased, but neither they render any assistance to the deceased. They tried to distance themselves from the incident. We are of the view that both SP7 and SP9 may have a purpose of their own to serve or to exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing. Their testimonies ought to be treated with caution and therefore corroboration was required, if their evidence were to be acted upon: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_333;"><i>Magendran Mohan v. PP</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 333</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 1; [2011] 1 CLJ 805; [2011] 2 AMR 680 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1967_1_597;"><i>Lim Boon San v. PP</i> [1967] 1 MLRH 597</LINK>; [1968] 2 MLJ 45.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> SP7 said that the beating of the deceased took place on the 14 April 2012 and 15 April 2012. The appellant had taken turns with Penang and Tan to beat up the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The testimonies of SP7 and SP9 are at variance as regard the duration and the manner the deceased was beaten up. SP7 testified that on 16 April 2012 the deceased was beaten up by the appellant from 8.00pm until 2.30am (17 April 2012), a duration of about 6½ hours.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On the other hand, SP9 said that the deceased was beaten from 8.00pm until 12.30am, which was two hours shorter than the duration testified by SP7. Unlike SP7, SP9 said he did not see anyone beating the deceased on 14 April 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> SD2 was on duty at Blok Gemilang from 11.30pm on 16 April 2012 to 2.00am on 17 April 2012. He would normally sit at a table on the ground floor, about 15-20 metres away from cell No 9. SD2 testified that he would go on foot patrol every 30 minutes at every level of the said block. If there was any noise, SD2 would be able to peep through a small window as can be seen in the photograph, exh P5(5).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The evidence of SP7 and SP9 appeared to have contradicted the evidence of SD2 on material issues and as such their veracity and truthfulness are questionable. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1967_1_597;"><i>Lim Boon San v. PP</i> [1967] 1 MLRH 597</LINK>; [1968] 2 MLJ 45, which was referred to with approval by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_333;"><i>Magendran Mohan v. PP</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 333</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 1; [2011] 1 CLJ 805; [2011] 2 AMR 680 observed at p 342 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On the totality of evidence adduced by the prosecution, we were not satisfied that the appellant intended to kill the deceased or the appellant had the knowledge that his act would in all probability cause death to the deceased. Though several external injuries were found on the deceased's body, they were mostly bruises, lacerations and haematoma on the temporal and left occipital region which were not fatal in nature, save the multiple broken ribs on the deceased's chest which caused "traumatic asphyxia", that led to the death of the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In examination-in-chief, SP6 explained "traumatic asphyxia" at p 42 of Appeal Record vol 1 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In cross-examination, SP6 went on to explain "traumatic asphyxia" at p 44 of Appeal Record vol 1 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On the issue of the broken ribs which was explained by SP6 which caused "traumatic asphyxia", there was not an iota of evidence before the trial court that the appellant had imposed his body weight or he had sat on the deceased's body or he compressed/applied pressure on the deceased's chest which culminated in the deceased death. Though admittedly, SP6 did not rule out that repeated stomping might also result in "traumatic asphyxia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is in evidence that the deceased was suffering from tuberculosis. Explanation 1 of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;299.;;">s 299 of the Penal Code</LINK> states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_4_555;"><i>Murugan Arumugam v. PP</i> [2013] 4 MLRA 555</LINK>; [2013] 3 MLJ 340; [2013] 5 CLJ 69, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The substantive cause of the deceased's death as stated by SP6 was "traumatic asphyxia". We find no evidence from SP6 to show that the acts of the appellant had in any way accelerated the deceased's death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Having considered the totality of the evidence, we find that the appellant was not totally blameworthy. The appellant would have known that his assault on the deceased would cause bodily injury to the deceased but we are of the view that the appellant would not have known that his assault would most probably result in the deceased's death. Further we note that SP6 had stated that there could have been more than one assailant. Therefore the death of the deceased could not be attributed to the appellant alone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we found the prosecution had failed to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. However, we found there was sufficient evidence for an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK> against the appellant. Accordingly, the appellant was found guilty, convicted and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment wef 9 September 2014.</p>
