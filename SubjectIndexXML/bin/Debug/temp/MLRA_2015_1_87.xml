    <p>This was an appeal against the Court of Appeal's judgment reversing the decision of the High Court which found the respondent negligent and in breach of statutory duties imposed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Local Government Act 1976 ('the Act')</LINK>. The facts showed that a tree had fallen onto the highway along Jalan Duta, crushing the car driven by the appellant and seriously injuring the appellant who became paralysed from the waist down. The appellant relied heavily on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> to prove that the respondent was negligent. However, the courts below did not find the doctrine applicable. The High Court held that the parties were unable to point out the exact location of the tree, but nonetheless, the respondent had a duty under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK> to remove or trim any tree, shrub or hedge, which in its opinion, was likely to endanger public safety. The High Court concluded that the tree was dangerous to the public as it was on a slope, a hundred feet tall and without leaves. The Court of Appeal found that the High Court erred in concluding that the tree posed a danger to the public, in the absence of expert evidence, merely because it was on a slope and had no leaves thereby leading to the unwarranted conclusion that all such trees without leaves located on a slope posed a danger to the public and ought to be removed. The Court of Appeal held that as the location of the tree could not be ascertained, ie whether it was on public or private land, a finding of fact could not be made on the danger the tree posed to the public due to insufficient evidence. In this appeal, the question before the court was as follows: to what extent did the powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> confer a duty of care on the local authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal by majority</p>
    <p>Per Raus Sharif PCA (Suriyadi Halim Omar and Ahmad Maarop FCJJ concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondent could require the owner or occupier of any premises to remove or trim the tree under the Act notwithstanding that the tree was on private land. The Act also did not prohibit the respondent from entering any private land to cut or trim trees that posed a danger to the public. The respondent should have constantly supervised and trimmed all hazardous trees, immaterial of whether the trees stood on its land or otherwise. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101 of the Act</LINK> clearly imposed a duty of care on the respondent, with the duty extending to the respondent to enter into private land to remove, lower or trim any tree, shrub or hedge before they caused harm due to the private owner's neglect or failure to remove or trim the trees. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK> the obvious danger to road users brought about by the tree aligned to the highway along Jalan Duta would justify the respondent entering the private property to remedy the situation. Unfortunately the respondent did not do so premised on the misconceived notion that it was not its business. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101</LINK> was worded in imperative terms, leaving no room for any discretion for the local authority in the exercise of its duty. The respondent was statutorily empowered to take the appropriate action when any breach was likely to endanger the public safety, namely, to trim or to require the owner or occupier of any premises to remove, lower or trim any tree. The words so employed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc)(i)</LINK>, ie "likely to endanger" gave rise to the probability of the occurrence of such incident that triggered the safety standard required by the local authority to take action before harm was caused. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101(cc)(i)</LINK> was a statutory duty imposing responsibility on the respondent to act and ensure that public roads were kept safe from trees aligned to them. (paras 22-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was a clear abdication of duty on the part of the respondent herein. Despite having a designated unit within its fraternity entrusted to carry out regular inspections, there was no evidence that the unit conducted any inspection at that site prior to the accident. In fact, there was also no evidence that the unit inspected the site at the time of the accident to determine the cause of the accident. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The respondent's designated unit was duty bound to patrol and inspect the place within its territory at all material times. Having done so, the unit was required to enter and maintain its daily logbook with observations or findings so as to decide on the next course of action to be taken. That was the very purpose why the unit was created. Unfortunately as admitted by the respondent, no investigation was conducted immediately after the accident. The respondent only carried out investigations concerning the cause of the accident after receipt of the writ of summons about three years after the accident. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The facts of the case did not indicate that the respondent, in maintaining the roads, made regular or routine checks on trees standing on the slopes along Jalan Duta. This was not a situation where a healthy tree had collapsed due to some disease that could not be perceived even by a layman. The element of foresight and due diligence was found wanting on the part of the respondent. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> A specific duty was created by the legislature to be discharged by the respondent for road users and the prevention of any harm that might be created. On the facts of this case, the respondent in the execution of its duty as imposed by the legislature failed to exercise skill, diligence and caution to the best of its ability. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> Since the respondent owed a duty of care towards the appellant, and had breached that duty, there was no necessity to dwell into the issue of whether the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> was applicable in the present case. The findings of the High Court and Court of Appeal on the same were concurred with. As the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> did not apply in the present case, the burden remained with the appellant to establish negligence and breach of statutory duty by the respondent. In the circumstances, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> conferred a duty of care on the local authority and the extent of that duty covered both public and private land. (para 27)</p>
    <p>Per Richard Malanjum CJSS (dissenting) (Zaleha Zahari FCJ concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The duties imposed upon a local authority by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> were not absolute but relative and depended on any given factual situation. There was nothing therein that imposed a higher obligation upon a local authority or in the nature of strict liability. The common law on negligence vis-a-vis such duties had not been varied by the Act. It was therefore only to that extent the duty of care was imposed upon a local authority by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc)</LINK>. (para 62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> did not apply in this case. As such the burden remained with the appellant to establish negligence and breach of statutory duty by the respondent. The doctrine was not a rule of substantive law but a principle of evidence. The doctrine did not prove negligence but only inferred the negligence. The doctrine did not apply when a defendant did not have exclusive control over the property or object that was alleged to have caused the damage or injury. It was insufficient for a plaintiff merely to present evidence of a defendant's negligence. A plaintiff must show that the type of injury suffered would not ordinarily occur unless the defendant was negligent. (paras 67-68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The Court of Appeal held that the location of the tree was of primary importance since a court of law could not make a finding of fact that the tree posed a danger to the public when there was insufficient evidence as to the precise location of the tree. Bearing in mind the extent of the duties of a local authority under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> and having considered the reasons given by the Court of Appeal in overturning the decision of the learned judge, there was no reason to interfere with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances, the appellant failed to prove his case on the balance of probability. (paras 69-71)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal in allowing the respondent's appeal and consequently setting aside the judgment of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> For ease of reference, the parties will be referred to as they were in the High Court. The appellant is the plaintiff and the respondent the defendant. The defendant is a local authority entrusted to administer the city of Kuala Lumpur pursuant to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;;">Local Government Act 1976 (the Act)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 21 March 2013, leave to appeal was granted to the plaintiff by this court for the determination on a sole question of law which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 2 October 2000 at about 5pm, the plaintiff was driving his Proton Perdana No WHJ 2676 along Jalan Duta Kuala Lumpur heading towards his office situated at Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd in Damansara Height. The plaintiff 's car was on the left lane of Jalan Duta about hundred and fifty meters away before turning into Damansara Height when all of a sudden a tree collapsed and crushed his car ("the accident"). As the result of the accident, the plaintiff suffered serious injuries and is now paralysed from neck down. His car was also badly damaged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The facts further revealed that the tree was situated on a hill slope on the left side of the road. The tree was close to one hundred feet in height. It had no leaves, and when it fell it covered all the four lanes of the highway. And it is also not in dispute that the accident happened after a thunder storm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 23 May 2002, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant for negligence and breach of statutory duties. The plaintiff contended that it was the duty of the defendant to ensure that all trees along the said road were properly trimmed or removed when they posed a danger to the public. And the defendant would be liable if it failed to carry out that duty and if such danger resulted in an accident. On the burden of proof the tree was a danger to the public and the plaintiff relied on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, thereby satisfying and shifting the burden to the defendant to rebut otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The defendant in response to the plaintiff 's action contended that the plaintiff had failed to establish the precise location of the tree that caused the injuries and damage to him. And as such the plaintiff had failed to establish that the tree had posed a danger to the public. Further it was contended that since the tree was located on a private land the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> could not be invoked in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned High Court Judge (trial judge) found that the defendant was negligent and had breached its statutory duties imposed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK>. In his judgment the trial judge recognised the fact that the parties were unable to point out the exact location of the fallen tree but ruled that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK> imposes a duty on the defendant to remove or trim any tree, shrub or hedge which in its opinion was likely to endanger public safety. The trial judge further held that the statutory duty of the defendant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK> was not limited to overseeing the trees planted by the defendant, but also extended to all trees in the city of Kuala Lumpur. It was held that the defendant is vested with the power to insist upon the owners of any private land to maintain trees, and if they failed to do so, the defendant can take action and subsequently bill the owners of the said private land. The court concluded that the tree had posed a danger to the public considering that the tree was on a slope, a hundred feet tall and without leaves. The court observed that the tree could not have gone unnoticed if regular inspection and patrols were carried out by the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At the Court of Appeal the defendant argued that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The Court of Appeal agreed with the arguments of the defendant and held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The full judgment of the Court of Appeal can be found in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_1_108;">[2013] 5 MLRA 108</LINK>; [2013] 3 CLJ 987.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc)(i) of the Act</LINK>, a duty is imposed on the defendant to act and ensure that public roads are kept safe from trees that are aligned to it. lt is a continuous duty imposed on the defendant by statute and the defendant must take positive steps towards discharging this duty. And it was submitted that the defendant did absolutely nothing in the discharge of its duty. This according to learned counsel was admitted by the defendant's witnesses, DW1 and DW2 that-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Thus, it was submitted that in light of the above evidence coming from the defendant's witnesses, the trial judge was right in holding that the defendant had failed to proffer any evidence to suggest that regular patrols and inspection had actually been done. It was further submitted that the trial judge was right in holding that, had regular patrol and inspection been done in that area, "the unit would have noticed this hundred feet tree without leaves standing by the slope. It should have attracted their attention. A tree without leaves standing upright in the midst of the lush green of Jalan Duta should never escape the attention of the unit".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On the issue of whether the tree in question did pose a danger to the public, learned counsel was relying on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>. According to him, the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> applies because:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned counsel for the defendant took a diametrically opposed view in that the powers conferred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> is invoked only when the element of danger is present. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101(cc) of the Act</LINK> clearly outlines that the power to remove, lower or trim any tree, shrub or hedge by the local authority only arises if the element of danger to the public is present. As such learned counsel submitted that pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc) of the Act</LINK>, before the local authority could exercise its powers, it must first be shown that the tree in question had posed a danger to the public. To this end learned counsel submitted that since the plaintiff had alleged that the defendant had failed to carry out its powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and 101(cc) of the Act</LINK>, it was the plaintiff 's burden of proof to show that the element of danger was eminent before this court could decide whether indeed the defendant had failed to exercise its powers under the said provisions. In support of his proposition learned counsel cited the cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2008_1_473;"><i>Hay Me Kian &amp; Anor v.

    <p>
      <b>Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Based on the sole question of law posed in the instant appeal we are to determine to what extent the powers conferred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> confers a duty of care on the local authority in this case, ie the defendant; and whether a duty of care exists; and, if so, what is the scope and extent of that duty. At the heart of this appeal lies the true interpretation to be given to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK>. In short, this court is to determine whether the defendant owes a duty of care towards the plaintiff in the instant case and if the answer is in the affirmative the extent of the duty; and, whether the defendant had breached such duty. The relevant <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> states that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> There is no doubt that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc)(i)</LINK> clearly imposes a statutory duty on the defendant to remove any tree that is likely to cause danger to public safety. The words in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc)(i)</LINK> is clear and unambiguous. It has been drafted in such a manner so as to impose responsibility on the defendant. It imposes a duty on the defendant to act and ensure that public roads are kept safe from trees aligned to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The question is whether the defendant was negligent in failing to act and ensure that the public road where the accident occurred was kept safe from trees that aligned it, including the taking of positive steps towards discharging that duty. It is trite that the burden lies on the plaintiff to establish its case on a balance of probability that the defendant was negligent. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_166;"><i>Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa Cheng Loon &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 166</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 389; [2006] 2 CLJ 1; [2006] 2 AMR 563).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Court of Appeal in reversing the decision of the High Court placed much emphasis on the location of the tree to prove danger. In its judgment the Court of Appeal held that "the location of the tree is of primary importance since a court of law cannot make a finding of fact that the tree posed a danger to the public when there is insufficient evidence as to the precise location of the tree. With respect, such a finding of the Court of Appeal is contrary to the undisputed facts of this case. It is an undisputed fact that the tree was situated on the hill slope on the left side of the road. The tree was close to 20 meters in height. It had no leaves and when it fell it covered all the four lanes of the highway. I am of the view that on the said undisputed facts, the plaintiff had established on a balance of probability that the tree posed a danger to the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Thus, the issue now is whether the defendant had breached the duty of care, and the extent of such breach. From the report prepared by the defendant, it admitted that the fallen tree was never maintained by the defendant because the tree was on a private land. For easy reference, I hereby reproduce the 'Laporan Pokok Tumbang di Jalan Duta' in its original language extracted from the grounds of judgment of the High Court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is clear from the report prepared by the defendant that the fallen tree was actually from two pieces of private land which the defendant had no control over. Thus, the defendant's stance was that any mishap to the road users caused by the trees located on private land was not within its jurisdiction. With respect, I disagree. In my considered view it does not matter that the tree was on a private land, as under the Act the defendant can require the owner or occupier of any premises to remove or trim the tree. The Act also does not prohibit the defendant from entering any private land to cut or trim trees that pose a danger to the public. The defendant should have constantly supervised and trimmed all hazardous trees, immaterial of whether the trees stood on its land or otherwise. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101 of the Act</LINK> clearly imposes a duty of care on the defendant, with the duty extending to the defendant to enter into private land to remove or lower or trim any tree, shrub or hedge before they cause any harm in light of the private land owner's neglect or failure to remove or trim the trees.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Based on the aforesaid provision the obvious danger to road users brought about by the tree aligned to the Highway along Jalan Duta would justify the defendant entering the private property to remedy the situation. Unfortunately the defendant did not do so premised in the misconceived notion that it was not their business. I find that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK> is worded in imperative terms, leaving no room for any discretion for the local authority in the exercise of its duty. The defendant was statutorily empowered to take the appropriate action when any breach is "likely to endanger the public safety" namely to trim the tree or to require the owner or occupier of any premises to remove, lower or trim any tree. The words so employed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc)(i) of the Act</LINK>, ie "likely to endanger" gives rise to the probability of the occurrence of such incident that triggers the safety standard required by the local authority to take action before harm is caused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101(cc)(i)</LINK> is a statutory duty which imposes a responsibility on the defendant to act and ensure that public roads are kept safe from trees aligned to it. As an authority for this proposition I refer to the case of <i>Ohrby v. The Ryde Commissioners</i> [1864] 5 B&amp;S 743 cited by learned counsel for the plaintiff. The Ryde Commissioners in that case were responsible to place fences on the footways for the protection of foot passengers. The Commissioners failed to carry out this duty. The plaintiff then slipped and fell off from the highway resulting in personal injuries. The court held that as a result of the powers given to the Commissioners, they had a duty to ensure that the footways were safe and hence liable for any injuries caused by their failure. The English King's Bench Division held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the case of <i>Ohrby v. The Ryde Commissioners (supra)</i>, much emphasis was placed by the court on the imperative words employed in the statute governing the duties of the Commissioners to impose a common law duty on the public authority for the protection of the road users/public. Similarly in our case I am of the considered view that the words employed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101</LINK> is clear in that it imposes a duty of care on the part of the defendant to protect road users/ public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In my judgment I find that there is clear abdication of duty on the part of the defendant. Despite having a designated Unit within the defendant's fraternity entrusted to carry out regular inspections, there is no evidence that Unit conducted any inspection at the site prior to the accident. In fact there is no evidence that the Unit even inspected the accident site at the time of the accident to determine the cause of the accident. I am of the view that the Unit was duty bound to patrol and inspect the place which is within its territory (including the place of the accident) at all material times. Having done so, the Unit was then required to enter and maintain its daily logbooks, which should contain its observations or findings, so as to decide on the next cause of action to be taken. This is the very purpose why the Unit was created. Unfortunately as admitted by the defendant, no investigation was conducted immediately right after the accident. The bitter fact was that the defendant only carried out investigation concerning the cause of the accident after receipt of the writ of summons, about three years after the occurrence of the accident. It is surprising to note that there is nothing from the facts of this case to indicate that the defendant, in maintaining its roads, had made regular or routine checks on trees standing on the slopes along Jalan Duta. This is certainly not a situation where it was a tree in apparent good health but collapsed due to the ravages of a disease that could not be perceived in the course of a careful layman's inspection. To this end I agree with the observation made by the trial judge that the defendant should not have missed the 'Batai' tree, "a tree without leaves standing upright in the midst of the lush green of Jalan Duta" if regular or routine checks had been conducted by the defendant. What the trial judge was trying to convey through his judgment was the element of foresight and due diligence which I feel was wanting on the part of the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In this regard I would like to refer to the House of Lords case of <i>Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Trustees v. William Gibbs &amp; Ors</i> [1866] English and Irish Appeals at p 93, wherein the principle postulated was that "if knowledge of the existence of a cause of mischief makes a person responsible for the injury it occasions, they will be equally responsible when by their culpable negligence, its existence is not known to them". This was an action brought against the authority in control of a shipping dock which was entrusted with cleaning, supporting and preserving the said dock. There was no doubt that it was their duty to perform the work imposed on them by the Act of the Legislature. A ship called the Sierra Nevada, in entering, or endeavoring to enter one of the docks, sustained injury by reason of a bank of mud left negligently at its entrance. The ship and its cargo were damaged due to striking a large bank of mud while navigating through the dock. Lord Cranworth in his judgment placed much emphasis in the element of knowledge. His Lordship in doing so held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mr Justice Blackburn held at p 103 that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the instant case I cannot accept this indifferent attitude in order to absolve the defendant of its duty of care. At the risk of repeating, I would like to highlight that a duty has been imposed on the defendant vide <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK> in clear terms. A specific duty has been created by the Legislature, to be discharged by the defendant, for road users and the prevention of any harm which may be created. In my judgment, on the facts of this case the defendant in the execution of its duty as imposed by the Legislature had failed to exercise to the best of its ability skill, diligence and caution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Since it is my findings that the defendant owes a duty of care towards the plaintiff, and has breached that duty, I do not propose to dwell into the issue of whether the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur applies</i> in this case. My decision to not touch on the issue of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> is consonant to the findings of the High Court and the Court of Appeal as this doctrine was not an issue before them. Based on the forgoing reasons, my answer to the sole question of law posed is that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> confers a duty of care on the local authority and the extent of that duty covers both public and private land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs. The orders of the Court of Appeal are therefore set aside. The orders of the High Court are reinstated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> My learned brothers, Suriyadi Halim Omar FCJ and Ahmad Maarop FCJ had the opportunity of reading my judgment in draft and they hereby concur with all the reasons stated therein that this appeal must be allowed with costs.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The appellant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal reversing the decision of the High Court. In his judgment the learned High Court trial judge ('the learned trial judge') held the respondent liable for negligence and 'a breach of statutory duties imposed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101' of the Local Government Act 1976 ('the Act')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> This appeal is therefore only on the issue of liability. There is one question posed for consideration. It reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It was not in dispute that on 2 October 2000 at about 5pm the appellant was driving his car, a Proton Perdana bearing registration number KHJ 2676 along Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur on the left side of the road. He was about 150 meters away from the junction to Damansara Heights where his office, Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd was located. Suddenly a tree ('the tree') fell on his car. The appellant was severely injured and his car was damaged as well. The tree that fell was on a private land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Due to the injuries he sustained and the damage to his car the appellant commenced an action against the respondent for breach of duty and negligence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It was the case for the appellant that the respondent had breached its statutory duty under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK>. It was asserted that the respondent was tasked under the Act to oversee all trees in the city irrespective of where they were located.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The appellant contended that the duty of the respondent included the responsibility of ensuring that all trees were properly trimmed or removed once they posed a danger to the public. The respondent would be made liable if it failed to carry out the duty and if such danger resulted in an accident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> As regards the element of danger to the public the appellant relied on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> ('the doctrine') thereby shifting the burden to the respondent to rebut otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In response to the claim of the appellant the respondent argued that the appellant had failed to establish the precise location of the tree that injured and caused damage to him. As such the appellant could not allege that the tree had posed a danger to the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Further, the respondent submitted that since the tree was located on a private land the doctrine could not be invoked in favour of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In his judgment the learned trial judge did not expressly rely on the doctrine to find that the appellant had discharged the burden of proof for his claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The learned trial judge went on to hold that the duty of the respondent extended to trees on private land and as such he did not consider the location of the trees as crucial in coming to his finding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> And in finding that the appellant had established that the tree was a danger to the public the learned trial judge premised his conclusion on the following facts, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The learned trial judge therefore found that the respondent was liable for negligence on the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> For the aforesaid reasons the learned trial judge concluded that he was satisfied that there was negligence on the part of the respondent and that the respondent had also breached its statutory duties imposed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the learned trial judge the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> While conscious of the constraint in interfering with the findings of the learned trial judge the Court of Appeal considered the respective contentions of the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> And having done so the Court of Appeal held that in order for the learned trial judge to make a finding of fact that the tree had posed a danger to the public its location on private land or otherwise must be first determined from the evidence adduced. In this case the Court of Appeal held that the appellant failed to produce any evidence as to the exact location of the tree.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The Court of Appeal also held that the learned trial judge erred in finding that the tree fell from a slope based on the evidence of PW2 and from an admission by the respondent as contained in a report prepared by DW2. Yet at the same time the learned trial judge acknowledged that DW2 only assumed that the tree was on a private land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> It was further held that even if the exact location of the tree was not critical the learned trial judge erred in finding the tree posed a danger to the public because it was without leaves and fell from a slope. The Court of Appeal held that not every tree located on a slope would pose a danger to the public without any evidence on the gradient and soil structure of the slope.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The Court of Appeal acknowledged that at the time and place of accident the wind was very strong and raining heavily as well. It was also noted that the tree was without leaves and of Batai specie. The Court of Appeal therefore opined that the appellant should have called an expert to give an opinion whether a tree of Batai Specie without leaves would normally be diseased. Such view was expressed because the learned trial judge seemed to have implied that all Batai trees without leaves located along Jalan Duta posed a danger to the public and ought to be removed. The Court of Appeal therefore held that without such expert evidence the irresistible conclusion would be that the appellant failed "to discharge the burden of proving" that the respondent was in breach of its duty of care. Failing to notice 'a tree without leaves standing upright in the midst of the lush green of Jalan Duta' could not result in the transfer of the burden of proving that the tree posed a danger to the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Submissions for the appellant</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions For The Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> For the respondent it was contended that the 'duty of care that is owed by the respondent to the appellant' was 'limited to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101' of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> While the respondent 'has the power to plant, trim or remove trees' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) of the Act</LINK>, its obligation and power to act under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc)</LINK> only arises 'if the element of danger to the public is present'. 'Without the element of danger present' the respondent could not 'simply remove, lower or trim any tree, shrub or hedge' pursuant to the said <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In other words, 'the powers conferred on the local authority such as the respondent under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc)' of the Act</LINK> 'is subject to the element of danger being present and proven based on the reading of the said sections'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The burden was therefore upon the appellant to establish first that the tree was a danger to the public before the accident occurred. In this case the appellant failed to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> By 'merely by relying on the fact that a tree fell and so the respondent must be held liable', would not 'discharge the burden of proof on the appellant's shoulder'. Moreover, the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> did not apply in this case as found by the Court of Appeal which held that 'just because the tree in question was on a slope, without any leaves and of "Batai" species', it did not necessarily mean that the tree was dangerous to the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> It was also submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101 of the Act</LINK> did not impose a strict liability upon the respondent as to relieve the appellant the burden 'to show that the respondent had failed to act within the powers conferred to it under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc)' of the Act</LINK> before the respondent could be found to be liable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> In summary, it was the submission of learned counsel for the respondent that 'the appellant must first show that the element of danger was present, that the respondent had failed to carry out the powers conferred on it under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc)' of the Act</LINK> and that 'only then could the respondent be found to have breached its duty of care towards the appellant'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In considering this appeal I bear in mind the question posed before me, namely, 'To what extent do the powers conferred under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Local Government Act 1976</LINK> confer a duty of care on the local authority.'</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The foregoing statutory provisions are clear on the statutory obligations of a local authority of which the respondent is one. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">Section 101(b)</LINK> stipulates a direct duty for a local authority 'to plant, trim or remove trees'. Meanwhile, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(cc</LINK>) authorises, <i>inter alia</i>, a local authority to require an owner or occupier of premises 'to remove, lower or trim to the satisfaction of the local authority any tree, shrub or hedge overhanging or interfering in any way with the traffic on any road or street or with any wires or works of the local authority or which in the opinion of the local authority is likely to endanger the public safety'. In the event of the owner or occupier of the premises failing to comply with the request by the local authority 'any authorised officer of the local authority may enter upon the said premises and carry out such work and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;115.;;">s 115</LINK> shall apply to the expenses incurred thereby'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Whether it is a direct duty or authorised to request another party to perform certain tasks, it remains the duties for a local authority to perform. It is the extent of those duties that requires consideration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> I begin by stating that those duties imposed upon a local authority by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc)</LINK> are not absolute but relative and depend on any given factual situation. There is nothing therein that imposes a higher obligation upon a local authority or in the nature of strict liability. The common law on negligence <i>vis-a-vis</i> such duties has not been varied by the Act. It is therefore only to that extent the duty of care is imposed upon a local authority by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Bearing therefore in mind the foregoing I now examine this case as presented.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Premised on the two provisions the appellant alleged that the respondent was negligent in failing 'to act and ensure that public roads are kept safe from trees that align it' and such negligence included failing to 'take positive steps towards discharge of this duty'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> With respect, the allegation invites an examination of the factual situation and since it is the appellant who is making it the burden falls upon him to establish it on the balance of probability. (See: <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;101.;;">s 101 Evidence Act 1950</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_166;"><i>Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa Cheng Loon &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 166</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 389; [2006] 2 CLJ 1; [2006] 2 AMR 563). It must also be borne in mind that 'negligence is a question of fact and not of law, that each case must depend on its own facts'. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1970_1_289;"><i>Ma Clyde v. Wong Ah Mei &amp; Anor</i> [1970] 1 MLRA 289</LINK>; [1970] 2 MLJ 183).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In this case the appellant relied heavily upon the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> to say that the respondent was negligent. However, the courts below did not find the doctrine applicable. The learned trial judge held that the 'burden is certainly on the plaintiff to prove negligence on the part of the defendant or that there was a breach of statutory duty by the same'. The Court of Appeal ruled that the 'absence of expert evidence is understandable because the respondent adopted, with respect, the erroneous position that he was entitled to rely on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> I agree with the findings of the courts below. The doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> did not apply in this case. As such the burden remained with the appellant to establish negligence and breach of statutory duty by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> It was held that the 'fundamental basis of the maxim (<i>res ipsa loquitur</i>) is that the rule that it is for the plaintiff to prove negligence and not for the defendant to disprove it, may cause hardship to the plaintiff if it is impossible for him to know what precise acts of omission led to his damage, and this is most obviously so where the cause of the damage is peculiarly within the means of knowledge of the defendant who caused it. This hardship can sometimes be avoided by the application of the maxim <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>'. (See: <i>Ma Clyde v. Wong Ah Mei &amp; Anor (supra)</i>). It should also be noted that the doctrine is not a rule of substantive law but rather a principle of evidence. The doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> does not prove negligence. It only infers the negligence. And the doctrine does not apply when a defendant did not have exclusive control over the property or object that alleged to have caused the damage or injury. Indeed it is insufficient for a plaintiff merely to present evidence of defendant's negligence. A plaintiff must show that the type of injury suffered would not ordinarily occur unless the defendant was negligent.</p>

      <b>[69]</b> In its judgment the Court of Appeal held that 'the location of the tree is of primary importance since a court of law cannot make a finding of fact that the tree posed a danger to the public when there is insufficient evidence as to the precise location of the tree'.</p>

      <b>[70]</b> Bearing in mind my view on the extent of the duties of a local authority under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(b) and (cc)</LINK> and having considered the reasons given by the Court of Appeal in overturning the decision of the learned trial judge, I find no reason to interfere with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal. I find that the learned trial judge erroneously came to his conclusion based on some assumptions as highlighted by the Court of Appeal.</p>

      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> Accordingly, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the appellant failed to prove his case on the balance of probability. Hence this appeal is dismissed. I order no costs in view of the unfortunate situation of the appellant. Deposit is to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
