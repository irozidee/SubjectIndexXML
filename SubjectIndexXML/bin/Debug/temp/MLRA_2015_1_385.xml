    <p>This was an appeal against the decision of the trial judge who had at the conclusion of the trial convicted all four appellants ("appellants") for the offence of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 Penal Code</LINK>. At the material time, the deceased, was at home together with his family, which comprised his wife ("PW5"), his son ("PW2") and two other sons, when they were awoken by noises coming from the back and suddenly a group of men entered the home through the front door of the house. Among the group, PW2 recognised the appellants as they were from the same village. The deceased immediately instructed his family to run out through the back door in order to escape. While hiding under a lorry ("the lorry") outside the house, PW2 and PW5 witnessed the appellants beating and slashing the deceased with long knives. The deceased died a week later in the hospital from injuries sustained during the attack ("the said injuries"). The said injuries were confirmed by the pathologist ("PW4") in his post-mortem report ("P9"). Subsequently, the appellants were charged for murder. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge found that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellants and ordered them to enter their defence. At the close of the defence case, the trial judge found that the defence of the appellants failed to raise a reasonable doubt and convicted the appellants. In the present appeal, the appellants raised the following issues: whether the trial judge erred in fact and in law in accepting the evidence of PW2 and PW5 despite contradictions and inconsistencies in their evidence and based on evidence of the first Investigating Officer ("PW8") on the location of the lorry; whether the identification evidence of PW2 and PW5 was doubtful and the identification of the appellants at the identification parade should be rejected; and whether the cause of death of the deceased was not sufficiently proven, as there was a probability that septicaemia had set in giving rise to a doubt whether the said injuries were the direct cause of the deceased's death, and accordingly the non-calling of the two doctors ("the said doctors") who initially treated the deceased was fatal to the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> On the alleged contradiction in PW2's evidence, this was clarified by PW2 in re-examination. What PW2 meant was that the deceased was not attacked or slashed in the house. PW2 was quite firm in his answers during cross-examination that when he looked back he saw somebody throwing a stick at the deceased and beating the deceased. Further, PW5 did not say she did not turn back but only that because she was in a state of panic she did not turn around to look behind her when running away from the appellants. Her evidence therefore did not contradict PW2's evidence as she had in the examination-in-chief testified that she saw the appellants hit the deceased. (paras 25-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge had considered very carefully the alleged contradictions or differences between PW2's and PW5's evidence and held that "PW5's and PW2's evidence about hiding under the lorry was reasonable, highly probable and certainly not illogical, fanciful or incredible in view of the circumstances surrounding the attack on the deceased at the material time". In any event, PW8 was not cross-examined regarding the location of the lorry. It was the trial judge who raised this issue with PW8. Hence, the 2nd appellant could not seek to contend that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence of PW2 and PW5 in totality. (paras 32, 34, 36 &amp; 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the present case, even if it could be argued that the court ought to have rejected the identification of the appellants at the identification parade, it did not necessarily mean that the identification of the appellants by PW2 and PW5 was unreliable or doubtful. In this instance, both PW5 and PW2 had positively identified the appellants in court during trial after identifying them at the identification parade. Apart from the positive identification of the appellants in court, the trial judge also took into consideration the fact that PW2 and PW5 had known the appellants since they were small as all of them lived in the same village. Furthermore, it was also in evidence that PW5 on the same morning that the incident took place had revealed in an interview with PW8 that she saw and recognised a few of the suspects, including the appellants. Therefore, even without the identification parade, the identities of the appellants were sufficiently proven. (<i>Ong Poh Cheng v. PP (refd)</i>) (paras 55-59)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> PW4's opinion that the said injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death could be inferred from his evidence and in P9 as to the cause of death of the deceased. In this instance, PW4 had in his oral testimony and in P9 given a detailed record of the said injuries and concluded that the cause of death was "severe head injury due to slashed injury and blunt impact on the head." Further, it was clear from PW4's evidence that in view of the seriousness of the said injuries the deceased would in all probability have died, with or without treatment. In other words, PW4's evidence on the nature of the said injuries was such that it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. (paras 64, 65, 74, 75 &amp; 76)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> On the evidence of PW4 and applying the test propounded in <i>R v. Smith</i> and adopted in <i>Leong Siong Sun &amp; Anor v. PP</i>, the substantive or operating cause of the deceased's death was the "severe head injury due to slashed injury and blunt impact on the head" and not septicaemia. There was no reason to disagree with the trial judge's finding. Hence, the non-calling of the said doctors was not fatal to the prosecution's case as the evidence of PW4 itself was sufficient. As a pathologist, PW4 was qualified to testify and give his expert opinion based on the observation or findings of others. The trial judge was entitled to accept the evidence of PW4 as an expert medical witness who had the advantage of seeing the demeanour of the witness. (<i>Chan Kwee Fong v. PP (refd)</i>). (paras 91-96)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The failure of the prosecution to call the said doctors did not leave a gap in the narrative of the prosecution case nor was the defence prejudiced or disadvantaged by the non-calling of the said doctors, and the question of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) Evidence Act 1950</LINK> being invoked therefore did not arise. Accordingly, the trial judge had made a proper and maximum evaluation of the evidence before her and came to a correct conclusion. Thus, there was no fundamental misdirection by the trial judge to warrant appellate interference. (<i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP &amp; Another Appeal (refd)</i> and <i>Lai Kim Hon &amp; Ors v. PP (refd)</i>). (paras 99, 101, 102 &amp; 103)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was an appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who had at the conclusion of the trial convicted all four appellants of the offence of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> All four appellants were initially charged separately and charges against them have been set out by the learned judge in her grounds of judgment at pp 165-167 of the Record of Appeal. For convenience we reproduce below the charge against the 4th appellant (P1) which encapsulates essentially the case against all four appellants:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The incident took place on 4 November 2003. At the material time, the deceased, one Sagatawan a/l Rajagopal was at home together with his family which comprised his wife, Ramoo d/o Alagerisamy (PW5) and his three sons, namely Baradhan, Thiagarajan and Thirumanan (PW2). At about 12.15am, PW2 and PW5 were awakened by noises coming from the back of the house. They saw the deceased opening the back window of the house to see what had caused the noise. At the same time the deceased asked PW2 to open and keep open the back door of the house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Suddenly a group of about eight male Indians (the assailants) entered the home through the front door of the house. Amongst the group, PW2 recognised all the four appellants as they were from the same village and lived about 100 meters, away from PW2's house. The deceased immediately instructed his wife and three sons to run out through the back door in order to escape from the assailants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The first to run out of the back door was PW5, followed by PW2, Thiagarajan, Baradhan and lastly the deceased. As PW2 was running he turned and looked back and saw from a distance one of the assailants named Nathan throwing a stick at the deceased. The stick hit the deceased on his leg and this caused the deceased to fall down.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Baradhan, Thiagarajan, PW2 and PW5 continued running. Whilst Baradhan had run far in front of them, Thiagarajan, PW2 and PW5 hid themselves under a trailer lorry at a distance of about 50-60 meters away from the spot where the deceased fell. Whilst the deceased was falling down on the road, the assailants encircled the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> According to PW2 he saw three of the assailants namely Selva, Das or Dhurgadhas (the 4th appellant) and Bala Murali (the 3rd appellant) hit the deceased with metal golf sticks and four of the assailants, namely Harindran (the 1st appellant), Nathan, Viji and Viki (the 2nd appellant), were slashing the deceased on his head, back and hand with long knives or 'parang panjang'. The attack was also witnessed by PW5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> PW2 then ran to the police station and informed the officer on duty of the attack. PW5 and Thiagarajan subsequently joined PW2 at the police station. They were later informed that the deceased was at the hospital.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The deceased died one week later on 11 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The deceased was injured on his head, his back and he also suffered a fracture of his head as was confirmed by the pathologist, PW4 who had conducted a post-mortem on the deceased. The cause of death according to PW4 was severe head injuries.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Trial Judge's Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(i) At The Close Of The Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> At the close of the prosecution case the learned judge found that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case against all the four appellants and ordered that they enter their defence to the charge. The learned judge's findings are found at pp 171-202 of the Record of Appeal and are principally as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>(ii) At The Close Of The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The 1st, 2nd and 4th appellants elected to give statements from the dock while the 3rd appellant gave evidence under oath.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The 1st, 2nd and 4th appellants' defence was that on 3 November 2005 at about 11.30pm they were at the 2nd appellant's house chit chatting, when at around 12 midnight they heard noises coming from outside the house. They went out to check and discovered that the noise came from another house. They became frightened and went back into the house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The 3rd appellant relied on and read out his cautioned statement (D11) in court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> He had given notice of alibi that he was somewhere else with one Sadesh on the night in question. He had also called his father as a witness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned judge did not believe the statements of the 1st, 2nd and 4th appellants. She found their explanation implausible, could not reasonably be true and did not cast a doubt on the prosecution's case. As for the 3rd appellant, the learned judge found that he had failed to prove his defence of alibi when he gave two conflicting versions concerning Rama in his defence. In his notice of alibi he said that he went to watch a Tamil movie with Sadesh and that he had hitched a ride from another friend called Rama. However in his sworn oral evidence he tried to, as the learned judge put it "get out of his predicament" by explaining that Sadesh and Rama refer to one and the same person because Rama is the nickname of Sadesh.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned judge found the 3rd appellant's defence was 'deliberately concocted' to extricate him from the serious charge facing him."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned judge found that the "defence of each of the four appellants and also their combined defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt and was therefore satisfied that the prosecution had proven the respective charges against all four accused beyond reasonable doubt."</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issues</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The appellants raised a number of issues in their petition of appeal but the main issues canvassed before us were the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We will deal with the first two issues together as the alleged contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence of PW2 and PW5 relate primarily to their evidence in identifying the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Learned counsel for the 1st, 3rd and 4th appellants submitted that PW2's evidence that he identified the assailants to be the 1st, 3rd and 4th appellants could not be accepted for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As for PW5, according to counsel her evidence that she had identified the 1st, 3rd and 4th appellants could not be believed. PW5 claimed that she took refuge under the lorry but as stated earlier there was no lorry at the place in question. Further PW5 said she ran away in a state of panic and conceded that she did not turn back. Hence she could not possibly see the assailants slashing the deceased. (See pp 57 and 58 of the Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Learned counsel for the 2nd appellant in adopting the above submission contended that the learned judge had erred in fact and in law in holding that the evidence of PW2 and PW5 was credible despite the contradictions and inconsistencies in their evidence. Counsel further alleged that in assessing the credibility of PW2 and PW5's evidence, the court had failed to take into consideration the fact that both PW2 and PW5 are interested witnesses as they are related by blood and marriage to the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We find no merit in this argument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On the alleged contradiction in PW2's evidence stated above, this was clarified by PW2 in re-examination as can be seen from the excerpt below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Thus what he meant was the deceased was not attacked or slashed in the house. In fact PW2 was quite firm in his answers during cross-examination that he saw somebody throwing a stick at his father when he looked back to see his father and that he saw his father being beaten by the assailants whilst hiding under a lorry, despite being repeatedly questioned by counsel. (See pp 41 and 42, Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As regards PW5, what she said in cross-examination at p 58 was to the following effect:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> She confirmed her answer in re-examination as seen at p 61 of the Record of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> PW5 did not say she did not turn back but only that because she was in a state of panic she did not turn around to look behind her when running away from the assailants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Her evidence therefore did not contradict PW2's evidence as she had earlier in examination-in-chief testified that she saw the assailant "memukul dan menetak suami saya" whilst hiding under the lorry together with PW2 and her other son Thirumaran. (See p 54, Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> As noted by the learned judge in her judgment "Aside from this difference in her evidence during her cross-examination the court found that her evidence remained, largely, unshaken."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We find in this regard that the learned judge had considered very carefully the alleged contradictions or differences between PW2 and PW5's evidence including the difference between PW2 and PW5's evidence concerning the time PW5 went to the police station (see p 201, Record of Appeal) and came to the correct finding as seen from the following excerpt of her judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> On this issue this is what the learned judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The learned judge went on to hold that "PW5's and PW2's evidence about hiding under the lorry was reasonable, highly probable and certainly not illogical, fanciful or incredible in view of the circumstances surrounding the attack on the deceased at the material time, to wit, the assailants were many in number and they were armed with lethal weapons."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We see no reason to disagree with the learned judge's finding. As a trial judge she is in the best position to determine whether PW2 and PW5 were telling the truth when they said they witnessed the incident whilst hiding under a lorry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In any event we note that PW8 was not cross-examined as regards the location of the lorry on the sketch plan (P10). It was the trial judge who raised this issue with PW8. Both counsel for the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 2nd appellant also failed to raise this issue (of the existence of the lorry at the material time and place) with PW2 and PW5 during cross-examination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In view of that learned counsel for the 2nd appellants cannot seek to contend that the judge had failed to consider the evidence of PW2 and PW5 in totality in arriving at the aforesaid finding in particular in failing to consider the distance between the lorry and the place where the deceased was assaulted and the ability of PW2 and PW5 to identify the assailants whilst hiding under the lorry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In fact when asked during cross-examination by counsel for the 3rd appellant about hiding under the lorry PW2 answered as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It was not put to PW2 that from where he was hiding it was not possible for him to see or identify who assaulted the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The other ground relied on by the appellants as to why the identification by PW2 and PW5 of the appellants to be the assailants of the deceased was doubtful, relates to the identification parade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Counsel for 3rd and 4th appellants submitted that both PW2 and PW5's evidence on the identification should be rejected as the officers in charge of the identification parade were not called. Their reports were also not tendered in evidence. The officers concerned were one, Chief Inspector Azmin, Chief Inspector Jamirin and Inspector Fadli.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Counsel contended that these witnesses were crucial because without their evidence and the reports it could not be ascertained whether PW2 and PW5 had identified the appellants or whether they were telling the truth.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Counsel for the 2nd appellant argued that the appellant had been prejudiced by the omission to tender the report and or to call these material witnesses. In view of this omission there has been a break in the chain of evidence with regards to the issue of identification of the 2nd appellant by PW2 and PW5 and the part he played in the incident even if it can be said that they have been identified by PW2 and PW5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the circumstances adverse inference ought to have been drawn against the prosecution for failure to call these witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The learned judge rejected this contention and held that the prosecution had discharged its duty by offering all the four police officers in question to the defence at the close of the prosecution case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> In our view the learned judge was not wrong in holding that adverse inference ought not to be drawn against the prosecution for not calling the four officers who conducted the identification parade as the identification of the four appellants by PW2 and PW5 at the identification parade was corroborated by PW7, ASP Mohd. Hafiz bin Yaacob, the third Investigating Officer who had directed the holding of the said identification parade. (See p 52 of the Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> PW7 in his evidence testified that he had recorded further statements from PW2 and PW5 after their positive identification of the four appellants at the identification parade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Learned counsel for the 2nd appellant had questioned whether the identification parade actually took place as PW7 who allegedly directed the holding of the identification parades could not identify any of the appellants in court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> However, as pointed out by the learned deputy public prosecutor (DPP) PW2's evidence that he had attended the identification parades at Balai Polis Klang and identified the four appellants on four separate occasions was not challenged by the defence during cross-examination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Neither was it put to PW5 during cross-examination that her evidence that she had "buat kawad cam sebanyak empat kali" was a lie.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Similarly with PW7. His evidence regarding the identification parade held in relation to all four appellants was unchallenged. (See pp 70-71, Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> It is useful at this stage to refer to the Court of Appeal case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_544;"><i>Ong Poh Cheng v. PP</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 544</LINK>; [1998] 4 MLJ 8; [1998] 4 CLJ 1; [1998] 4 AMR 3225. In that case, the trial judge had made a finding that the identification parade that was held to identify the appellant was defective and on that ground rejected the identification. The learned judge however ruled that the identity of the appellant as the robber had been conclusively proved by his identification in court and by other incriminating evidence and in the circumstances convicted the appellant after rejecting his defence that he only displayed an imitation gun.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The main ground of appeal before the Court of Appeal was the identification of the appellant. Counsel for the appellant had argued that the judged erred in accepting the identification of the appellant in court after having ruled that the identification of the appellant at the identification parade was defective.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The Court of Appeal however rejected this argument and held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Thus in the present case even if it can be argued that the court ought to have rejected the identification of the appellants at the identification parade for the reasons stated earlier, it does not necessarily mean that the identification of the appellants by PW2 and PW5 was unreliable or doubtful as contended by the counsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> In this case too, both PW5 and PW2 had positively identified the four appellants in court during trial after identifying them at the identification parade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> Apart from the positive identification of the four appellants in court, the learned judge also took into consideration the fact that PW2 and PW5 had known these four appellants since they were small as all of them lived in the same village. Based on this fact the learned judge held that "their ability to recognize the four accused that night was highly probable and not inherently incredible or unlikely." (See p 214 of the Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> It was also in evidence that PW8, the investigating officer met with PW5 on the same morning that the incident took place and a contemporaneous interview with her revealed that she saw and recognised a few of the suspects.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> We therefore agree with the learned DPP that even without the identification parade, the identities of the appellants were sufficiently proven.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(iii) The Cause Of Death Of The Deceased Have Not Been Sufficiently Proven</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In their petition of appeal, the 1st, 3rd and 4th appellants contended that the learned judge misdirected herself when she failed to realise that the pathologist (PW4) never gave his opinion as to whether the injuries sustained by the deceased were sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Secondly the learned trial judge misdirected herself when she failed to recognise that the failure of the prosecution to call both the doctors (Dr Terry and Dr Tai) who initially treated the deceased had compromised the case for the prosecution. This is so because PW4 cannot rule out septicaemia as one of the cause of death. The 2nd appellant raised the same issue as regards the non-calling of Dr Terry and Dr Tai as witnesses and contended that the learned judge was wrong in not invoking <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> against the prosecution for its failure to call these two witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The learned judge therefore erred in law when it rejected the defences' contention that there was a reasonable doubt as to the cause of the deceased's death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> With regard to the 1st ground, in our view the learned judge did not err in concluding that the four appellants had "... caused such injuries to the deceased as would in the ordinary course of events cause the death of the deceased" even though PW4 did not expressly state so in his evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> In our view PW4's opinion that the injuries suffered by the deceased were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (limb (c) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>) can be inferred from his evidence as to the cause of death of the deceased. PW4 had in evidence specifically stated that "sebab kematian ialah kecederaan parah kerana luka tetak dan impak tumpul di kepala."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> In his post-mortem report (P9), the cause of death was stated as "severe head injury due to slashed injury and blunt impact on the head."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> PW4 went on to describe in detail the fatal injuries suffered by the deceased ("kecederaan parah yang boleh membawa kematian ...") which were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The aforesaid injuries according to PW4 could be caused by:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Although PW4 found some of the injuries ("di kulit kepala") were about to heal, he nevertheless found that the injuries suffered by the deceased (<i>supra</i>) "<b>sekiranya si mati tidak diberi rawatan ia akan mati</b>. Sebab kecederaannya adalah agak parah. Si mati dalam kes ini mendapat rawatan seterusnya dan s<b>ampai peringkat tertentu ia boleh mati walaupun telah mendapat rawatan</b>." [Emphasis Added]</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Based on PW4's evidence above we would agree with learned DPP that "..., there is no doubt that the act is murder done with the intention to cause death as the act must in all probability cause death." Learned DPP referred to the Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1976_1_279;"><i>Tham Kai Yau &amp; Ors v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1976] 1 MLRA 279</LINK>; [1977] 1 MLJ 174 in support of the above proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> Learned counsel for 1st, 3rd and 4th appellants also relied on the same case to support their contention that PW4 never gave his opinion as to whether the injuries sustained by the deceased were sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death which was fatal to the prosecutions case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> In <i>Tham Kai Yau</i>, on appeal the appellants were convicted of the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The evidence in the case showed that the appellants attacked the deceased and did intend to cause bodily harm to the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> However the Federal Court found that the distinction between murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder was not put clearly to the jury in such a way that they would be able to come to a correct conclusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> It was held by the Federal Court <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> In the present appeal, the pathologist, PW4 as seen earlier had in his oral testimony and his report (P9) given a detailed record of the nature of injuries inflicted on the deceased and came to the conclusion that the cause of death was "severe head injury due to slashed injury and blunt impact on the head."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> He had also under cross-examination expressed the opinion that "Sekiranya si mati tidak diberi rawatan ianya akan mati. Sebab kecederaannya adalah agak parah. Si mati di dalam kes ini mendapat rawatan seterusnya dan sampai peringkat tertentu ia boleh mati walaupun telah mendapat rawatan."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> Thus it was clear from PW4's evidence that in view of the seriousness of the deceased injuries the deceased would in all probability have died, with or without treatment. In other words it was clear from PW4's evidence that the nature of injuries sustained by the deceased was such that it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> The next issue is whether there is a probability that septicaemia has set in giving rise to a doubt whether the injuries were the direct cause of the deceased's death. The deceased in this case was alive when he was brought to Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah (HTAR) Klang on 4 November 2005. He survived for a week and was pronounced dead on 11 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> PW4's evidence on septicaemia was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> Based on the aforesaid evidence of PW4, learned counsel for the 1st, 3rd and 4th appellants contended that the two doctors who treated the deceased at HTAR Klang Dr Terry and Dr Tai should have been called to exclude septicaemia as a separate cause of death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> Learned counsel for the 3rd appellant argued that in light of SP4's evidence that septicaemia may have set in, Dr Terry and Dr Tai's evidence was crucial in explaining what happened during the one week that the deceased was hospitalized bearing in mind that the deceased's injuries had started to heal whilst he was receiving treatment in HTAR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> In this regard it was counsel's submission that the failure or omission to call or offer material witnesses leads to the following four circumstances:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The learned DPP submitted that firstly PW4 in his testimony only suggested "some probability" of septicaemia. However PW4 in his evidence was certain that there were no indications or signs that there was bacterial infection to the brain or the injury. Secondly PW4 had concluded in his report that the cause of death was "kecederaan parah kerana luka tetak dan impak tumpul di kepala." (See P9).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> This means that the operating cause was still the serious injuries to the head.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> Learned DPP submitted this was the test recognised by the authorities to determine the culpability of the accused. This was established in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1985_1_175;"><i>Leong Siong Sun &amp; Anor v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1985] 1 MLRH 175</LINK>; [1985] CLJ 523 (<i>Leong Siong Sun</i>) where Peh Swee Chin J as he then was adopted the test in <i>R v. Smith</i> as to "what is the operating cause and substantial cause at the time of death."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> In the above case, the facts were briefly as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> The two appellants were convicted under s 304 of the Federal Code for having caused the death of one Kim Yong with the intention of causing such bodily injuries as was likely to cause death. The medical evidence showed that the deceased died of rupture of the intestine with peritonitis. The appellants were convicted by the Sessions Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> On appeal it was argued that the death was not caused by the rupture inflicted by the appellants but by the failure of the deceased to be treated properly and the deceased's own negligence in discharging himself thereby foregoing the operation. The medical evidence showed that if treated adequately and on time, the rupture would not have been fatal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> In such circumstances the issue raised was whether the appellants could be convicted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304 of the Penal Code</LINK> instead of having merely caused grievous bodily harm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> Learned DPP referred to the following passage from the judgment of Peh Swee Chin J where His Lordship concluded that applying the test in <i>R v. Smith</i> [1959] 2 All ER 193, he concluded that in circumstances of this nature, the test would be whether at the time of death the original wound was still an operating cause and a substantial cause, albeit that some other cause was also operating:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> Thus, according to the learned DPP applying the aforesaid principle to the present case it could not be said that septicaemia was the cause of death or that it was so overwhelming that it rendered the original wound insignificant. The original wound in the present case was still an operating cause and a substantial cause, and that the death of the deceased can properly be said to be the result of that cause.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> We agree with the submission of learned DPP that on the evidence of PW4 and applying the test propounded by Lord Parker CJ in <i>R v. Smith (supra)</i> as adopted by Peh Swee Chin J in <i>Leong Siong Sun (supra)</i>, the substantive or operating cause of the deceased's death was the "severe head injury due to slashed injury and blunt impact on the head" and not septicaemia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> As observed by the learned judge in rejecting the defence's contention that there was a reasonable doubt as to the cause of the deceased's death by septicaemia due to infection, because of the failure of the prosecution to call the two doctors who had attended to him and treated him after he was admitted to the hospital:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> We have no reason to disagree with the learned judge's finding which, contrary to the contention of learned counsel for the appellants, was extrapolated from PW4's evidence. This was what PW4 said under cross-examination at p 52 of the Appeal Record.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He then went on to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> In re-examination PW4 whilst maintaining "memang berlaku proses penyembuhan di kulit," nevertheless stressed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> In the light of PW4's evidence above, the non-calling of the two doctors who initially treated the deceased is not fatal to the prosecution's case as the evidence of PW4 itself is sufficient. As a pathologist, PW4 is most qualified to testify and give his expert opinion based on the observation or findings of others.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> In our view also the learned judge was entitled to accept the evidence of PW4 as an expert medical witness who had the advantage of seeing the demeanour of the witness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> As observed by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_723;"><i>Chan Kwee Fong v. PP</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 723</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 441; [2010] 3 CLJ 671, it is entirely up to the tribunal of fact to attach any weight to the opinion evidence of an expert.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> This court should therefore be slow to interfere with the learned judge's findings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> For the above reasons, the failure of the prosecution to call these two witnesses would not lead to the four circumstances suggested by learned counsel earlier (see para 81 (of this judgment)), that is:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> In the final analysis we find that the three main issues raised by the appellants above relate primarily to findings of facts and credibility of witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[101]</b> We find that the learned judge had made a proper and maximum evaluation of the evidence before her and came to a correct conclusion. We therefore see no reason to interfere with her findings and conclusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[102]</b> In support of our decision we need only refer to Abdul Hamid FCJ's (as he then was) judgment in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_634;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 634</LINK>; [2004] 3 MLJ 737; [2004] 3 CLJ 737; [2004] 5 AMR 265 wherein His Lordship quoted the following passage from the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_366;"><i>Lai Kim Hon &amp; Ors v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 366</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 84.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[103]</b> We find in the present appeal no fundamental misdirection by the learned judge to warrant our interference. We therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and sentence of the appellants.</p>
