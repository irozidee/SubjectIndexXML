    <p>The appellant was charged with two offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act")</LINK> for trafficking in cannabis. At the material time, SP6, a police officer, led a police team and caught the appellant on suspicion of possessing drugs, whereby six packets suspected to be cannabis were found. Following that, the appellant was arrested and SP6 administered the caution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1)(b) of the Act</LINK>. SP6 then proceeded to asked the appellant certain questions. Pursuant to the answers given by the appellant ("the said statements"), SP6 and the police team found further packets suspected to be cannabis in a car used by the appellant ("the car") and in the appellant's apartment ("the apartment"). The various packets were later confirmed by the chemist to be cannabis ("the drugs"). Consequently, the appellant was charged in the High Court, where the trial judge found that the prosecution had proved that the appellant had custody, control and <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs, and, accordingly, the prosecution had established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant. Subsequently, the trial judge invoked the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>, and the appellant was ordered to enter his defence. The appellant's defence was that the drugs found in the car and the apartment belonged to one Azizi bin Saleh ("SP11"). At the end of the defence case, the trial judge found that the defence was an afterthought. The trial judge accepted the evidence of SP11 and found that the evidence of the investigating officer ("SP12"), who testified that his investigation showed that SP11 was not involved in this case, supported SP11. Accordingly, the trial judge found that the defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case, and the appellant was found guilty and convicted. In the present appeal, the appellant raised the following issues: that the trial judge had erred in allowing prejudicial evidence, ie the said statements and had failed to hold a trial-withina- trial; that the trial judge had misdirected herself when she failed to make a finding whether the defence case had rebutted the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>; and that the trial judge had failed to judicially appreciate the entire case, because the trial judge's grounds of judgment adopted large parts of the written submissions of the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Upon a perusal of the evidence of the appellant, nowhere in his evidence did the appellant allege that force or coercion was used on him by SP6 nor was the issue of voluntariness raised in his submissions. Hence, the appellant made the statements to SP6 voluntarily. The question of holding a trial-withina- trial did not arise. There was also no basis for the submission that it was SP11 who had supplied the information leading to the discovery of the drugs. Accordingly, the said statements made by the appellant to SP6 together with his conduct which led to the discovery of the drugs, were admissible. The trial judge did not misdirect herself in considering these matters when making her decision, and thus there was no merit to this issue. (paras 24 &amp; 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Assessing credibility was difficult and was best left to the trial judge who had the audio-visual advantage of a witness in action (<i>Md Zainudin Raujan v. PP (refd)</i>). In the present appeal, the trial judge had considered the evidence of SP11 and had accepted it. Further, the trial judge had also found that the evidence of SP12 supported the evidence of SP11. Having considered the defence evidence and the prosecution evidence, the trial judge had come to the definite conclusion that the appellant's defence was an afterthought and that the defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and to rebut the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. Therefore, the trial judge had not misdirected herself. (<i>Wong Joo Sen v. PP (refd); Ng Chai Kem lwn. Pendakwa Raya (refd)</i>). (paras 30-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was not wrong for the trial judge to reproduce parts of the written submissions of the prosecution which she agreed with, although it was highly improper for a judge to copy the written submissions of counsel wholesale, and without acknowledging the source. In the present case, it was patently clear that the trial judge had copied wholesale the written submissions without acknowledgment. However, upon carefully scrutinising the grounds of judgment, notwithstanding the copious reproduction, on the evidence adduced, the trial judge would have come to the same finding, ie that the prosecution had established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant. There was ample evidence to support the finding of the trial judge that the appellant had custody, control and <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs and in invoking the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. Thus, the trial judge was correct to order the appellant to enter his defence, and the defence had failed to rebut the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. Hence, the conviction of the appellant was safe. (<i>Cojocaru v. British Columbia Women's Hospital and Health Centre (refd)</i>). (paras 33-36)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aziah Ali JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged with two offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act")</LINK> for trafficking in 26,462 grams of cannabis in a Volvo car bearing registration no PBE5155 at the car park of Block B, Pangsapuri Seri Nilam, Bandar Baru Ampang, Selangor on 14 July 2010 at about 7.40pm, and for trafficking in 780 grams of cannabis in apartment B-12, 7th Floor of the same apartment block at 8pm on the same date. He was found guilty and convicted on both charges by the High Court at Shah Alam and was sentenced to death, hence the appeal to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard his appeal and by a unanimous decision we dismissed his appeal and affirmed the convictions and sentences. We now give our reasons below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Salient Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 14 July 2010, SP6 Mohd Normal Hisyam bin Malkan led a police team to conduct an operation in the area of Masjid Kg Baru, Kuala Lumpur. The appellant was seen arriving on a Yamaha Nuovo motorcycle bearing registration no WTN5549 (exh P100). Evidence adduced by the prosecution shows that the motorcycle was bought in February 2010 by SP5, Sahul Hameed, who is a contractor and had employed the appellant as a site supervisor. The motorcycle was for the appellant's use. SP5 paid the monthly instalments for the motorcycle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant parked the motorcycle at the rear of the mosque. SP6 and his team then rushed and arrested the appellant and found six packets suspected to be cannabis. SP6 conducted a search on the motorcycle and underneath the seat SP6 found a chocolate coloured sling bag (exh P109). From the bag SP6 found one set of house keys (exh P110), one set of car keys (exh P126) and a black wallet. Inside the wallet (exh P118) was the appellant's identity card. SP6 gave the bag back to the appellant to hold. The motorcycle key (exh P120) and road tax (exh P119) were recovered from the appellant's right trouser pocket.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In cross-examination SP6 agreed that after the appellant was arrested and the car keys and house keys were found, he administered the caution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1)(b) of the Act</LINK>. The appellant indicated that he understood the caution. SP6 asked the appellant certain questions. Pursuant to the answers given by the appellant, SP6 and his team together with the appellant went to the Pangsapuri Seri Nilam in Ampang.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the parking lot beneath the apartment block, the appellant pointed out a blue coloured Volvo car bearing registration number PBE5155 (exh P101). Evidence was adduced which showed that this car was bought by SP5 who had given the car to the appellant in early 2009. Since SP5 handed over the car to the appellant, he had never used the car. There is only one set of keys to the car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> SP6 asked for the keys to the car and the appellant took out the keys from the sling bag exh P109. Using the key, SP6 opened the car boot and found two bags bearing the brand name 'Platinum Jeans' (exh P83) and 'defender' (exh P61) respectively. From exh P83, SP6 recovered 10 packets of compressed material suspected to be cannabis wrapped in transparent cellotape. From exhibit P61, SP6 recovered 19 packets of compressed material suspected to be cannabis also wrapped in cellotape.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> SP6 then asked certain questions to the appellant and pursuant to his answers, they proceeded to the appellant's apartment on the 7th floor. SP4 Rusmah Abdullah, the appellant's wife, in her evidence confirmed that she and the appellant had been staying at the said apartment owned by the late wife of SP5, since early 2009 at a monthly rental of RM500.00. This was confirmed by SP5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> SP6 gained entry into the apartment by using the house keys given to him by the appellant. Inside the apartment, SP6 said the appellant showed him a bag bearing the brand name 'Uptown' (exh P11) which was in a room in the apartment. From this bag, SP6 found an orange-coloured plastic bag (exh P12) and inside it SP6 found three packets of compressed material suspected to be cannabis wrapped in cellotape (exhs P13, P14, P15). From a cabinet in the room SP6 found the appellant's identity card (exh P117).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> SP6 assisted by one ASP Badrol and one D/Sgt Sahdan then took the appellant together with the exhibits seized to the Criminal Investigation Department at the Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur. At the police headquarters, SP6 marked the bag with the brand name 'Platinum' as 'B' and the 10 plastic packets found inside it as 'B1' to 'B10' and signed his name (exhs P63 to P81). SP6 weighed the bag together with the contents and found the gross weight to be 9,353 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> SP6 marked the bag bearing the brand name 'defender' as 'C' and the 19 packets found inside it as 'C1' to 'C19' and also signed his name (exhs P23 to P59). He weighed the bag together with its contents and found the gross weight to be 17,844 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> SP6 marked the bag with the brand name 'Uptown' as 'D1', the orange coloured plastic and the three plastic packets found inside it as 'D2' to 'D5' respectively. Similarly, he put his signature on the exhibits. He also weighed this bag together with its contents and found the weight to be 827 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> SP6 handed over the exhibits seized from the appellant at the time of arrest in Kg Baru to the investigating officer in Kuala Lumpur, SP7 Insp Prakphat s/o Tim, while the exhibits seized in Ampang (exhs P121 and 122) were handed over to SP12 Insp Mohd Asraf bin Mohd Sikon (exhs P123 and 124) who kept the exhibits in a locked locker in his office. On 16 July 2010 SP12 went to the appellant's apartment to conduct investigation. SP6 was already there when he arrived. Apart from taking photographs of the interior of the apartment and the parking lot beneath the apartment, SP12 found one blue-coloured t-shirt (exh P102) from the master bedroom. SP12 had also taken photographs of the Volvo car and from inside the car SP12 found one black coloured t-shirt (exh P103).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 20 August 2010 SP12 sent the exhibits to the Chemistry Department. SP1, Maimonah binti Sulaiman received a box marked 'X' inside which were the bag marked as 'D1' (exh P11) and three packets of compressed material wrapped in plastic and cellotape marked as 'D3', 'D4' and 'D5' (exhs P13, P14 and P15) which were inside an orange-coloured plastic bag marked as 'D2' (exh P12). SP1 found the compressed material to be cannabis. SP1 prepared her report (exh P8) which shows that the net weight of cannabis in the three packets is 780 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> On the same date, SP12 handed over two boxes marked 'Y' and 'Z' respectively to chemist SP2, Zulkefli bin Mohd Edin. Box 'Y' contained the bag exh P61 and 19 packets of compressed material wrapped in plastic and cellotape marked 'C1' to 'C19' (exhs P23 to P59). The box marked 'Z' contained the bag exh P83 and 10 packets of compressed material marked as 'B1' to 'B10' (exhs P63 to P81). SP2 confirmed the compressed material in both boxes to be cannabis. SP2 prepared his report (exh P20) which shows that the net weight of the cannabis in box 'Y' is 17,365 grams and the net weight of the cannabis in box 'Z' is 9,097 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In her evidence SP4, Rusmah Abdullah the appellant's wife, confirmed that the sling bag exh P109, the bag bearing the brand name 'defender' exh P61, the motorcycle exh P100, the Volvo car exh P101, the jacket bearing the brand name 'Sony' exh P102, a black t-shirt exh P103, the motorcycle helmet exh P106 all belonged to the appellant. However SP4 was not able to identify the 'Uptown' bag (exh P11) when shown the photograph of the bag. She also said that she had one set of keys to the apartment and the appellant had the other set. SP4 was not able to identify the items in photographs marked P21 nos 1 to 5.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> On the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the learned judge found that the prosecution has proved that the appellant had custody, control and <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs. In finding that the prosecution has established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant, the learned judge considered:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned judge invoked the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. The appellant was ordered to enter his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Essentially the appellant's defence was that he had no knowledge of the drugs and that the drugs belonged to one 'Misai'. According to the appellant, he was also a masseur and he would go to his client's house or his clients would come to his apartment. The appellant says that two days before his arrest, SP11 Azizi bin Saleh, who is also known as 'Misai', had come to his house for a massage. SP11 had brought a bag with him and when SP11 left after the massage, SP11 had left the bag in his apartment. SP11 had also requested to borrow his car and he had lent the car to SP11, who then returned the car to him on the morning of the day that he was arrested. Thus the defence sought to show that the drugs found in the car and in the apartment belonged to SP11. SP11 in his evidence admitted that he knows the appellant and his wife SP4, but denied having gone to the appellant's house or having borrowed the appellant's car or motorcycle. He said he has his own car. He denied having seen the bags exhs P11, P61 and P83 or knowing their contents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> At the end of the defence case, the learned judge found that the defence is an afterthought. Her Ladyship accepted the evidence of SP11 and found that the evidence of the investigating officer SP12, who testified that his investigation showed that SP11 was not involved in this case, supported SP11. The learned judge had also considered the evidence of SP4, the appellant's wife, who testified that when she visited the appellant at the prison after his arrest, the appellant had told her that SP11 had come to the apartment for massage one or two days before the incident and had also borrowed the car. However she was not able to confirm the truth of what the appellant had told her. She also had no knowledge about the bags, exhs P61 and P83. In conclusion, the learned judge found that the defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case and the appellant was found guilty and convicted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Before us learned counsel for the appellant, Encik Ameenuddin Ibrahim raised the following issues:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>First Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> This issue relates to the answers given by the appellant in response to questions by SP6. SP6 agreed with learned counsel that he had administered the caution after he recovered the car keys and the house keys from the appellant from the chocolate coloured sling bag (exh P109) which was found underneath the motorcycle's seat. SP6 said he had read out the caution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37A.;;">s 37A(1) (b) of the Act</LINK> which was recorded in his investigation diary ("ID") and had explained it to the appellant. The appellant indicated that he understood the caution. However SP6 did not record the questions asked and the appellant's answers. SP6 said he asked the appellant "ada lagi tak dadah jenis ganja yang kamu simpan" and the appellant said "ada lagi lebih kurang 29 ketul disimpan di dalam but kereta Volvo yang diparking di kawasan rumah". Pursuant to this, the police party and the appellant proceeded to the Pangsapuri Seri Nilam. After SP6 seized the drugs found in the boot of the car, he asked the appellant "ada lagikah dadah ganja ini?" and the appellant replied "ada lagi sikit di dalam rumah". Then they proceeded to the appellant's apartment from where SP6 seized the bag exhibit (exh P11).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Learned counsel submitted that the evidence of SP6 regarding his questions to the appellant and the answers by the appellant ought not to be admitted. Learned counsel submitted that the trial judge ought to have held a trial-within-a-trial to determine the admissibility of the statements made by the appellant in order to determine whether the appellant did give the information to SP6. It is contended that there is a possibility that the information came from SP11 who could have been arrested earlier on the same day that the appellant was arrested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor ("DPP") relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> and submitted that no trial-within-a-trial was required since voluntariness is not an issue with regard to statements made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27</LINK>. In support, the learned DPP referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_230;"><i>Francis Antonysamy v. PP</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 230</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 389; [2005] 2 CLJ 481. In that case, one of the issues before the Federal Court was whether the information supplied by the accused under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> was admissible. The late Augustine Paul JCA (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of the court said <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We have perused the evidence of the appellant and nowhere in his evidence did the appellant allege that force or coercion was used on him by SP6. Nowhere in the submissions made by learned counsel is the issue of voluntariness raised.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> On the evidence, we find that the appellant did make the statements to SP6 voluntarily. Thus, the question of holding a trial-within-a-trial does not arise. We also find no basis for the submissions made by the learned counsel that possibly it was SP11 who had supplied the information leading to the discovery of the drugs. Having perused the cross-examination of SP11, we find that SP11 was not asked whether he was the person who had given to the police the information that led to the discovery of the drugs. In fact, SP11 in crossexamination disagreed with the suggestion that he was arrested on the same day that he had returned the car to the appellant. We find that the appellant's answers to SP6 together with his conduct which led to the discovery of the drugs in the car and in his apartment are admissible. Therefore the learned judge has not misdirected herself in considering these matters when making her decision at the end of the prosecution case. For these reasons we find no merit on this issue.</p>

      <b>Second Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In the grounds of judgment, the learned judge stated that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and the defence has failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. Her Ladyship said as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Learned counsel submitted that the learned judge has misdirected herself when Her Ladyship had failed to apply the '<i>Radhi</i> direction', in reference to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311, ie by failing to make a finding whether the defence case had rebutted the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In <i>Radhi</i>'s case, the Federal Court found that the learned judge offered practically no reason why the defence, notwithstanding its falsity and unconvincing nature, had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case, other than to state by way of lip service the duty placed by the law on the defence to earn an acquittal. In those circumstances, The Federal Court said that:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_2_306;"><i>Wong Joo Sen v. PP</i> [2010] 2 MLRA 306</LINK>; [2011] 1 MLJ 581; [2010] 8 CLJ 392, one of the issues before the Federal Court was whether there was a misdirection on the standard of proof by the trial judge. It was asserted that the trial judge committed a misdirection when she ruled that the defence failed to cast doubt on the truth of the prosecution's case. The Federal Court held <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>[31]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_4_99;"><i>Siew Yoke Keong v. PP</i> [2013] 4 MLRA 99</LINK>; [2013] 3 MLJ 630; [2013] 4 CLJ 149; [2013] 3 AMR 202, Wan Yahya Pawan Teh HMA said <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Reverting to the present appeal, the learned judge had considered the evidence of SP11 and had accepted it. Assessing credibility is difficult and is best left to the trial judge who had the audio-visual advantage of a witness in action. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_3_351;"><i>Md Zainudin Raujan v. PP</i> [2013] 3 MLRA 351</LINK>; [2013] 3 MLJ 773; [2013] 4 CLJ 21; [2013] 3 AMR 480). Her Ladyship also found that the evidence of SP12, the investigating officer, who testified that his investigation showed that SP11 was not involved, as supporting the evidence of SP11. Having considered the defence evidence and the prosecution evidence, Her Ladyship came to the definite conclusion that the appellant's defence is an afterthought and that the defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. We agree with the learned judge. We find no merit on this issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Third Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Learned counsel submitted that the learned judge had failed to judicially appreciate the entire case because at the end of the prosecution case Her Ladyship had, in her grounds of judgment, adopted large parts of the written submissions of the prosecution (see p 8 of the learned counsel's written submissions). Learned DPP in his reply conceded that the learned judge had reproduced 20 pages out of 98 pages of the written submissions of the DPP in the court below. However, it is submitted that the learned judge did consider the submissions by both parties and having done so, agreed with the prosecution and adopted the written submissions of the prosecution. Learned DPP submitted that it is not wrong for the learned judge to reproduce parts of the written submissions of the prosecution when Her Ladyship agreed with the prosecution on any particular issue. It was further submitted that despite the shortcomings in the learned judge's grounds of judgment, the evidence adduced by the prosecution is strong and no appellate intervention is warranted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Whilst we agree with the position taken by the prosecution in relation to the manner the grounds of judgment was written in this case, we are not to be taken as condoning the act of copying written submissions. We are of the view that it is highly improper for a judge to copy the written submissions of counsel wholesale, and without acknowledging the source. In the present case, it is patently clear in the judgment of the learned judge that the written submissions had been copied wholesale without acknowledgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We wish to refer to the case of <i>Cojocaru v. British Columbia Women's Hospital and Health Centre</i> [2013] 2 SCR 357. In that case, the main question in the appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada was whether a trial judge's decision should be set aside because his reasons for judgment incorporated large portions of the plaintiff 's submissions. We respectfully adopt the views as expressed in the judgment of the Honourable Chief Justice wherein he said <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>His Lordship said further:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thus the Supreme Court concluded that while it is desirable that judges express their conclusions in their own words, incorporating substantial amounts of material from submissions or other legal sources into reasons for judgment does not, without more, permit the decision to be set aside. Only if the incorporation is such that a reasonable person would conclude that the judge did not put her mind to the issues and decide them independently and impartially as she was sworn to do, can the judgment be set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In the present appeal, we have carefully scrutinised the grounds of judgment of the trial judge and we agree with learned DPP that, notwithstanding the copious reproduction of the prosecution's submissions in the grounds of judgment, on the evidence adduced, the learned judge would have come to the same finding, ie that the prosecution has established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant. We find ample evidence to support the finding of the learned judge that the appellant had custody, control and <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs and in invoking the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. Thus on the totality of the evidence we find that the learned judge is correct to order the appellant to enter his defence. Having considered the defence and having re-examined the prosecution case, Her Ladyship found that the defence is an afterthought. We find no reason to disagree. Having perused the evidence we find that the defence had failed to rebut the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK>. We find that the conviction is safe.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> For the reasons stated above, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence.</p>
