    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the findings of the High Court which were affirmed by the Court of Appeal which allowed the respondent's claim for payment under an interim certificate and for additional works and dismissed the appellant's counterclaim for damages for defective works. The appellant had, pursuant to an agreement ('the agreement') appointed the respondent as the sole and exclusive contractor to construct and complete a camp in accordance with the terms and conditions therein. In this appeal, the appellant submitted, amongst others, that the trial judge erred in his finding that the defence relating to the validity and enforceability of the interim certificate was not pleaded and hence should be considered; the Court of Appeal erred when it assumed that by virtue of cls 16 and 17 of the agreement, any challenges to the validity of the interim certificate should be brought before an arbitral tribunal, as the parties had by their conduct waived their right to go to arbitration and referred their disputes to be resolved in court instead; the interpretation by the courts below of cls 16 and 17 of the agreement contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> ('s 29'); and the courts below erred in holding that the appellant was not entitled to be compensated because there was no instruction from the defendant or the architect ('PW2') by virtue of cl 7.2 of the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It would be wrong to allow the appellant to resile from the agreement and benefit from its own wrong or default in failing to refer the dispute on the decision of the PW2 to arbitration particularly under cls 16 and 17 of the agreement. In this case, cls 16 and 17 had set out in clear terms the steps to be taken in case of a dispute with a specific time frame prescribed therein. Therefore, the issue raised by the appellant on the validity and enforceability of the interim certificate was a non-issue. This was a plain case where parties were called upon to honour their part of the bargain when they entered into the agreement. Hence, it was unnecessary to dwell into the validity or enforceability of the interim certificate or the decision of PW2. (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Upon consideration of the wordings of cls 16 and 17 of the agreement, those clauses did not contravene <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29</LINK>. Such a conclusion was supported by the fact that cls 16 and 17 of the agreement provided for a two tier dispute resolution, ie in the initial level, the dispute was to be referred to PW2, and thereafter to a sole arbitrator should there be no decision given by the PW2 within the stipulated time frame or if a party was aggrieved by the decision. Further, it was pertinent to note that the arbitration agreement under those clauses did not impose any absolute restriction on or expressly ousted the jurisdiction of the court. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> On the facts and circumstances of this case, the trial judge was justified in dealing with the claim for defective works as falling under cl 7.2 of the agreement and to dismiss it on the ground that in the absence of any written instructions from the appellant or PW2 concerning the defects or other faults in the works. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the appellant failed to refer its dispute on the decision to arbitration resulting in the decision becoming "final and binding upon the parties". The High Court correctly found that the various reasons for non-payment of the interim certificate amount by the appellant were "non-starters" because of the failure by the appellant to adhere to the contractual mechanism for dispute resolution. The arbitral mechanism was contemplated by the cls 16 and 17 of the agreement to which the parties were bound. Accordingly, there was no necessity to answer any of the leave questions posed.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Raus Sharif PCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal relates to a claim by the respondent, Alpharich Sdn Bhd, (plaintiff in the High Court) under a building contract for payment under an interim certificate and for additional works. It also involves a counterclaim by the appellant, Juara Serata Sdn Bhd (defendant in the High Court) for damages for defective workmanship and for making good the construction defects, and liquidated and ascertained damages for delay in the completion of the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The High Court allowed the plaintiff's claim for the amount of RM1,202,500.00 under the interim certificate with interest thereon, but dismissed the claim for additional works. The High Court also dismissed the defendant's counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 15 October 2012 the Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant's appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Leave to appeal was granted to the defendant by this court on 3 July 2013 on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We heard the appeal on the 21 May 2015 and adjourned the matter for decision. We now give our decision and reasons for the same.</p>
    <p>Background Facts</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6] </b>The background facts have been sufficiently set out in the judgment of the High Court, the Court of Appeal and fully expanded in the submissions of the parties. For the purpose of this appeal, it suffices to outline merely in summary from the salient major facts bearing on this dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7] </b>By a letter of award dated 22 September 2004 ("letter of award"), the defendant was appointed by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) as a camp operator for the National Service Program at the Proposed Pusat Latihan Khidmat Negara, Kem Unity at 32nd Mile, Jalan Kuching, Serian Sarawak (Unity Camp). The appointment required the defendant to prepare all the infrastructure, training elements and facilities, tools and instruments as per the Schedule of Compliance for the Unity Camp.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> By an agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff dated 28 March 2005 ("agreement"), the defendant appointed the plaintiff as the sole and exclusive contractor to construct and complete the Unity Camp in accordance with the terms and conditions therein on a turnkey basis with a completion date of 31 May 2005. Under the agreement, the defendant as the employer was to pay the plaintiff a consideration sum of RM4,950,000.00 "upon certification by the Client that the Works have been duly completed" (cl 2 of the agreement).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Being a turnkey project, the plaintiff as the contractor was obliged to design as well as to construct the project. An architect was appointed by the plaintiff as required under the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 11 July 2005, the architect pursuant to cl 7.1 of the agreement, duly certified, vide Certificate of Practical Completion, that the works were practically completed on the 7 July 2005. The defendant had unconditionally accepted the handing over of the completed works, and had operated the site for PLKN.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Before accepting, a site inspection was conducted by the architect on 16 January 2006 in the presence of the plaintiff and the defendant's representatives to determine the status of the building works, with a Site Valuation Report produced. The works were confirmed as 100% completed, but a "Building Defect List" was prepared as well, which included "sagging roof", "roof leakage", "sagging ceiling", "apron crack" and "ponding at toilet and bathroom areas", with a notation: "Detail investigation is required at all Blok Kediaman Pelatih to determine the soundness of roof structure for occupancy".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 21 November 2006, the architect issued the Interim Payment Certificate, ie Interim Payment Certificate No 1 for the sum of RM1,202,500.00. The sum of RM1,202,500.00 was arrived at on the basis of work done as at 21 November 2006, on the agreed contract sum of RM4,950,000.00 less previous payments made to plaintiff (RM3,500,000.00) and less retention sum of 5% (RM247,500.00).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> This interim certificate was issued under cl 8 of the agreement, in particular, cl 8.1 which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Clauses 8.2 and 8.3 provide for the retention by the employer of the 5%, and cl 8.4, the payment of interest at 1% per month calculated on a day to day basis from the due date (date of receipt of the interim certificate) until payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was evident that the interim certificate was issued after the expiry of the defects liability period that had ended ten months earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The defendant denied that the plaintiff had completed the works in accordance with the agreement and averred that the Certificate of Practical Completion by the plaintiff's architect was not acceptable to the defendant, the Ministry of Defence and its financier, Affin Bank Bhd. The defendant averred that the plaintiff had failed to carry out the works in accordance with the agreement, in that, it had failed to appoint the consultants or professionals as required by the Ministry of Defence. The defendant also averred that the works carried out by the plaintiff were "not done in a good workmanlike manner and/or of a standard suitable for the known requirements of the Ministry of Defence".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> With the said reasons, the defendant decided not to pay for the sum as certified in the Interim Certificate No 1 Consequently, the plaintiff initiated proceedings in the High Court for the sum of RM1,202,500.00 as well as for a sum for the additional work done. In response, the defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiff for the sum of RM1,338,459.44 as special damages, ie the sums expended on third parties to complete the works and to remedy the defects which the plaintiff was obliged to complete under the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As stated earlier, the High Court allowed the plaintiff's claim on the interim certificate but not its claim for additional works. The High Court also dismissed the defendant's counterclaim. The learned trial judge held, <i>inter alia</i>, that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant's appeal. The Court of Appeal held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>At The Federal Court </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the learned trial judge erred in his finding that the defence relating to the validity and enforceability of Interim Certificate No 1 was not pleaded and consequently refused to consider the same. The learned counsel emphasised that the contrary to be true for the same was pleaded in very clear terms at para 8 of the defence and counterclaim. The error on the pleading point had resulted in the High Court misdirecting itself and refusing to consider the issue which had occasioned a serious miscarriage of justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned counsel for the defendant also submitted that the Court of Appeal erred when it assumed that by virtue of cls 16 and 17 of the agreement, any challenges to the validity of the interim certificate should be brought before an arbitral tribunal within a further seven days after the expiration of the fourteen days after receiving the architect's decision. The learned counsel submitted that the Court of Appeal erred in its finding, as the situation under cls 16 and 17 had no bearing to the situation in this case when parties had by their conduct waived their right to go to arbitration and referred their disputes to be resolved in court instead. This point of contention is better understood by reproducing the submissions of the learned counsel, which is along these lines:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The learned counsel also argued that the certificates of the architect in this case were not intended to be final. It could be challenged in arbitration if the parties choose to go to arbitration, but crucially, can similarly be challenged in court if the parties chose to come to court as they do here. The learned counsel cited the case of <i>Beaufort Developments (NI) Ltd v. Gilbert-Ash (NI) Ltd</i> [1998] 59 Con LR 66 and <i>Robins v. Goddard</i> [1905] 1 KB 294 as an authority for his proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned counsel further submitted that the interpretation of the courts below in respect of cls 16 and 17 had deprived the defendant of having his disputes heard in court. Further, the learned counsel argued that such an interpretation as one which was accorded to by the courts below would contravene <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. To this end, the learned counsel argued that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29 of the Contracts Act</LINK> does not allow for any contractual provision which purports to forfeit one's rights to pursue legal or arbitral proceedings if the same is not commenced within a particular period as prescribed under cls 16 and 17.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned counsel also submitted that the High Court and the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the defendant was not entitled to be compensated because there was no instruction from the defendant or PW2 as by virtue of cl 7.2 of the agreement, the contractor is to remedy the defective works within the defects liability period. The learned counsel submitted that a defects liability clause is meant to be merely an additional protection for the employer and will not affect or limit any of the employer's rights under the common law. Further, the law requires a contract to set out in clear terms if one's rights at common law are to be taken away. Clearly, the learned counsel emphasised that nowhere in cl 7.2 of the agreement was it stated that this clause extinguishes the defendant's rights to damages under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;;">Contracts Act 1950</LINK> or at Common Law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The learned counsel for the plaintiff conversely submitted that the courts below did not commit any error in taking the approach that the parties were bound by the terms of the contract to follow the dispute resolution process under cls 16 and 17 of the agreement. Under the said clauses, parties were required first to refer their dispute to the architect/consultant for a decision and thereafter to refer the dispute to arbitration if no decision was given by the architect/consultant within fourteen days or if either party was aggrieved by the decision. Both clauses read together provide for the legal consequence that, if the aggrieved party fails to refer the dispute on the decision of the architect/ consultant to arbitration within the stipulated time, the decision shall be final and binding on the parties</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned counsel further submitted that cls 16 and 17 of the agreement do not contravene <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29 of the Contracts Act</LINK> as they provide for a two tier dispute resolution, ie first to the architect/consultant and thence to a sole arbitrator. The arbitration agreement under these clauses does not impose any absolute restriction on or expressly oust the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As for the issue of the defendant's claim for the defective works, the learned counsel emphasised that on the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the learned trial judge was justified in dealing with the claim for defective works as falling under cls 7.2 of the agreement and to dismiss it on the ground that in the absence of any written instructions from the defendant or the architect (PW2) concerning the defects or other faults in the works, this aspect of the defendant's counterclaim was clearly unfounded by virtue of cl 7.2 of the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The issue before us is whether the High Court, as well as the Court of Appeal, had erred in interpreting the relevant provisions of the agreement. We have perused through the Record of Appeal and after hearing the submissions of the parties, we find that the courts below did not commit any error in taking the approach that the parties are bound by the terms of the contract to follow the dispute resolution process under cls 16 and 17 of the greement. Under the said clauses, parties are required first to refer their dispute to the architect/ consultant for a decision and thereafter to refer the dispute to arbitration if no decision is given by the architect/consultant within fourteen days or if either party is aggrieved by the decision. Both clauses read together provide for the legal consequence that, if the aggrieved party fails to refer the dispute on the decision of the architect/consultant to arbitration within the stipulated time, the decision shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Thus, we agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that it would be wrong to allow the defendant to resile from the agreement and benefit from its own wrong or default in failing to refer the dispute on the decision of the architect to arbitration particularly under cls 16 and 17 of the agreement. To appreciate the salient terms of cls 16 and 17 of the agreement, we reproduce below the relevant parts of these clauses:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Premised on cls 16 and 17 of the agreement, what the courts below did was to stop parties from going back on what they have agreed. We have no reason to disagree. In this case, cls 16 and 17 set out in clear terms the steps to be taken in case of a dispute with a specific time frame prescribed therein. The learned counsel for the defendant had raised the issue relating to the validity and enforceability of the interim certificate. With respect, we find that it is a non-issue. This is a plain case where parties are called upon to honour their part of the bargain when they entered into the agreement. The real issue here is whether the parties to a contract were in breach of the terms they have agreed to. In this regard, we agree with the views expressed by the Court of Appeal when it found it unnecessary to dwell into the validity or enforceability of the interim certificate or the decision of the architect but rather based its decision on the terms of the agreement entered into by the parties. This is clearly reflected in the judgment of the Court of Appeal at pp 11 to 12 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The next point we shall advert to is the contention urged upon us by the learned counsel for the defendant in that the interpretation of the courts below in respect of cls 16 and 17 had deprived the defendant of having his disputes heard in court. Further, the learned counsel argued that such an interpretation as one which was accorded to by the courts below would contravene <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29 of the Contracts Act</LINK>. The substance of this contention is that s 29 of the Contracts Act does not allow for any contractual provision which purports to forfeit one's rights to pursue legal or arbitral proceedings if the same is not commenced within a particular period as prescribed under cls 16 and 17.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We may in this connection, refer to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Upon consideration of the wordings of cls 16 and 17 of the agreement, with respect, we find that cls 16 and 17 do not contravene <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;29.;;">s 29 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. We are fortified in coming to this conclusion based on the fact that cls 16 and 17 of the agreement provide for a two tier dispute resolution, ie in the initial level, the dispute is to be referred to the architect/consultant, and thereafter to a sole arbitrator should there be no decision given by the architect/consultant within the stipulated time frame or if a party is aggrieved by the decision. It is pertinent to note that the arbitration agreement under these clauses does not impose any absolute restriction on or expressly oust the jurisdiction of the court. We may in this connection and by way of emphasis, reproduce below the following excerpt from Julian Bailey on <i>Construction Law</i>, vol III, at p 1442. The eminent author on the same subject had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In the present case, the High Court rejected the defendant's claim for the amounts expended by the defendant to third parties to remedy defective works because it could not show any written instructions to the plaintiff to make good the defects under cl 7.2. As regards the LAD claim, the High Court relied on the proviso to cl 6 which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We agree with the above finding of the learned trial judge as affirmed by the Court of Appeal. On the facts and circumstances of this case, the learned trial judge was justified in dealing with the claim for defective works as falling under cl 7.2 of the agreement and to dismiss it on the ground that in the absence of any written instructions from the defendant or the architect (PW2) concerning the defects or other faults in the works. Thus, this aspect of the defendant's counterclaim is clearly unfounded.</p>

      <b>[36]</b> In the final analysis, we would go as far to state that the defendant in this case is not in a position to resile from the terms inserted in the agreement which had imposed obligations on it. To allow it to do so would be tantamount to allowing a party in breach to take advantage of its own wrong. Parties must be held to their bargain. In our instant case, the decision of the courts below were based upon a consideration of the dispute resolution process in cls 16 and 17 of the agreement which required an initial reference to the architect/consultant for a decision and if no decision was made by him or if either party was aggrieved by the decision, it may then refer the dispute to arbitration. The defendant failed to refer its dispute on the decision to arbitration resulting in the decision becoming "final and binding upon the parties". The High Court found, which we have no reasons to disagree, that the various reasons for nonpayment of the interim certificate amount by the defendant were described as "non-starters" because of the failure by the defendant to adhere to the contractual mechanism for dispute resolution. The arbitral mechanism is contemplated by cls 16 and 17 of the agreement to which parties were bound.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In light of our findings above, there is no necessity to answer any of the leave questions posed. We hereby dismiss this appeal with costs.</p>
