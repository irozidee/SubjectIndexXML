    <p>A 25-year timber licence was issued to the appellant in 1983 ("the licence"). The conditions attached to the licence <i>inter alia</i> were: (i) the licence was not transferable; and (ii) that the appellant could not allot, issue or register the transfer of any shares of the appellant without prior consent of the Sarawak Timber Development Corporation ("STIDC"). On 14 December 1983, the shareholders of the appellant transferred all their shareholdings to a third party company ("Solana Sdn Bhd"). At the same time additional, shares in the appellant were issued to two others. On 5 July 1984, another issuance of shares occurred in Solana Sdn Bhd which saw new shareholders in Solana Sdn Bhd. These transfers of shares in the appellant and the issuance of shares in Solana Sdn Bhd were done without any consent obtained from the Director of Forests ("DW7") as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Forests Ordinance (Sarawak) (Cap 126) ("the Ordinance")</LINK>. On 11 March 1987, the appellant received a letter from DW7 informing it that its licence had been revoked ("first revocation"). However, the appellant successfully quashed the first revocation in the Kuching High Court. In view of the High Court's decision, the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly amended <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Ordinance</LINK> and inserted a new <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A of the Ordinance</LINK> which became effective on 1 January 1988. On 4 April 1988, the Minister, following the procedure laid down in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A of the Ordinance</LINK>, wrote to the appellant seeking an explanation as to why its licence should not be revoked in view of the continuing breaches of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2)(b) of the Ordinance</LINK>. The Minister was not satisfied with the explanation of the appellant and cancelled the licence ("second revocation"). The appellant contended that the second revocation amounted to misfeasance in public office. The appellant also contended that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A of the Ordinance</LINK> was unconstitutional as it contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. The appellant thus filed the instant suit and sought declaratory reliefs in respect of the two revocations. The High Court dismissed the appellant's claim. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The issues that arose for determination, <i>inter alia</i>, were (i) whether the plaintiff 's claim in respect of the first revocation was statute-barred by reason of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;;">Public Authorities Protection Act 1948 ("PAPA")</LINK> and/or the provisions of the Limitation Ordinance (Sarawak) (Cap 49); (ii) whether there had been a breach or contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Ordinance</LINK> by the appellant in having allowed its controlling shares to be transferred without the authorisation of the Director of Forests; (iii) whether the revocation of the appellant's timber licence was done to serve a political purpose; and (iv) whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A of the Ordinance</LINK> (as amended) was <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The revocation date for the first revocation was the date of the letter - 11 March 1987 - issued by the Director of Forests. The suit was filed on 31 July 1990. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">Section 2(a) of the PAPA</LINK> stipulates that any action against any person exercising a public duty must be done within 36 months from the date of the act complained of or, in the case of a continuance of injury or damage, within 36 months next after the ceasing thereof. Item 19 of the Limitation Ordinance (Sarawak) (Cap 49) provides that a limitation period of two years for suits claiming for compensation for any malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance, independent of contract and such period to commence from the act of misfeasance. Thus, in the instant case, the relief in respect of the first revocation was time-barred by four months. (paras 23, 24 &amp; 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The licence given to the appellant was subject to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2)(b) of the Ordinance</LINK>. The Director of Forests possessed the power to grant consent or authorisation for events set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2)(a)-(d) of the Ordinance</LINK>. There was no abdication of power by the Director of Forests to the Minister of Resource Planning under the then new <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A</LINK>. There was indeed a transfer of shares without the consent of the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent and there was a continuing breach by the appellant of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2)(b) of the Ordinance</LINK>. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> If the evidence of the appellant through cross-examination by the respondents' counsel was devalued or had not reached a level to be believed, then the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant had not proved its case requiring the respondents to rebut. In the instant case, the burden of proof had not shifted at the end of the appellant's case at trial. The Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_526;"><i>Solid Investments Ltd v. Alcatel-Lucent (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 526</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 785; [2014] 3 CLJ 73; [2014] 1 AMR 348 had opined the principle in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_74;"><i>Takako Sakao v. Ng Pek Yuen &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 74</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 751; [2010] 1 CLJ 381 was subject to a plaintiff at the end of his or her case having overcome the burden of having proved a <i>prima facie</i> case and failing which the court was not required to enter judgment for the plaintiff, should the defendant elect not to give any evidence. (paras 36 &amp; 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;"> Section 2(2) of the Ordinance</LINK> expressly prohibits any transfer without the consent of the Director of Forests and non-compliance of the same tantamounts to an illegal act which no court would allow any litigant to premise its cause of action on. Public policy dictated that the courts deem that the appellant could not premise its action on a licence tainted with illegality. (para 58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The High Court had found that the second revocation was not affected by political motives. This court saw no reasons to depart from the findings of the High Court judge. (paras 65-66)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>David Wong Dak Wah JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court of Kuching dismissing the appellant/plaintiff 's claim against the respondents/defendants. The appellant's claims in substance concern declaratory reliefs in respect of two revocations of a timber licence issued to the appellant by the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent and general damages for breach of contract and in tort of 'misfeasance in public office'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We, after hearing submissions, dismissed the appeal with costs and now give our grounds of judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The background facts have been set out in details by the learned judge and we adopt them. In this judgment we only set out the salient parts of the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant through its Director Haji Mohd Louis Ali, had, on 27 July 1982 applied to the then Minister of Forestry Datuk Haji Nor Tahir for a timber licence and the application was approved on 19 July 1983 by the Minister. A Forest Licence T/0279 (licence) was then issued to the appellant by the then Director of Forests. The licence was for a period of 25 years from 10 October 1983 to 9 October 2008 and for an area of 188,926 hectares.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The conditions attached to the licence were these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The shareholders of the appellant at the time of the issuance of the Licence were Haji Deli Abdul Rahman (Haji Deli) and Haji Louis Ali (Haji Louis). However on 14 December 1983, both Haji Deli and Haji Louis at the behest of PW5 (Norlia Abdul Rahman) transferred all their shareholdings to Solana Sdn Bhd. The evidence also shows that at the same time the shares in the appellant were issued to two others with the following shareholding status in the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 5 July 1984 another issuance of shares took place in Solana Sdn Bhd with the result that Lembaga Amanah Kebajikan Melayu Miri, Lembaga Amanah Kebajikan Darul-Falah (BINA), Anib Plantations Sdn Bhd, Crista Holdings Sdn Bhd, Polycarp Enterprise Sdn Bhd, Haji Louis Ali, Haji Deli and Datuk Shabuddin Mat becoming shareholders in Solana Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It is undisputed that when the licence was issued in 1983 and the time when the just-mentioned transfers of shares in the appellant and Solana Sdn Bhd, no consent was obtained from the Director of Forests as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of Forests Ordinance (Sarawak) (Cap 126) ('Forests Ordinance')</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> To regularise the transfers, the appellant on 6 September 1985 wrote to the Director of Forests to obtain his consent for the transfers of shares to Temenggong Baya Malang, POU (Baram) Sdn Bhd and Solana Sdn Bhd. The appellant had also on 5 January 1984 wrote to STIDC requesting the same consent but no reply was forthcoming until 1 October 1985 when the Secretary/ Legal Officer of the STIDC, one Zakaria Kawi, informed the appellant that since the allottees were members of the appellant before the appellant accepted STIDC's letter of offer, STIDC's consent was not necessary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Despite the letter from Zakaria Kawi, the board of STIDC had considered the appellant's application for consent and had decided to refer that application to the Minister of Resource Planning for decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On or about mid 1986, the appellant had obtained permits to enter the area to start logging operations and had entered into a contract for logging with one Maludan Sdn Bhd on 9 February 1985.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 11 March 1987, the appellant received a one sentence letter from the then Director of Forests (DW7) informing it that its licence had been cancelled and revoked (first revocation). As a result of the letter of cancellation, the appellant took legal remedy through suit KG5/1987 to quash the revocation of licence decision of the Director. Prior to the hearing of that suit, the appellant received a letter from the then Director informing it that the reason for the revocation of the licence was the failure to comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> in appointing Maludan as logging contractor and transferring of controlling shares in the appellant without the consent of the Director of forests.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is undisputed that the appellant's sole stand on this dispute was that the decision to revoke the timber licence was politically motivated. This related to what is known in the Sarawak political history as the 'Ming Court Affair' which occurred in March 1987. What had happened was that Tun Abdul Rahman (PW9) led a group of state assemblymen of the Sarawak Legislature and their allies to topple the Minister of Resource Planning who was then the Chief Minister of Sarawak. That attempt failed as the Chief Minister dissolved the State Legislative Assembly and caused an election which the Chief Minister and his party were returned as the Government of the State.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> However, the appellant succeeded on the legal front when the High Court Kuching quashed the revocation of the Minister of Resource Planning and on appeal to the then Supreme Court, Salleh Abbas LP held that the Minister of Resources Planning had failed to abide by the 'principle of fairness and prudent administration' to allow the appellant to make representation as to why its licence should not be cancelled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In view of the decision of the High Court Kuching, the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly amended <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2)</LINK> and inserted a new <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> which became effective on 1 January 1988. The amended <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A</LINK> read respectively as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On 4 April 1988, the Minister through the Permanent Secretary and following the procedure laid down in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> wrote to the appellant seeking explanation as to why its licence should not be revoked in view of the continuing breaches of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2)(b) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK>. The appellant on 3 May 1988 replied and requested for the right of oral hearing and arbitration as provided under the licence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The Minister was not satisfied with the explanation and through the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Resource Planning, informed the same to the appellant and accordingly cancelled the licence (second revocation).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Though the appellant was accorded the right of appeal to the Majlis Mesyuarat Kerajaan Negeri under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A(3) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> against the second revocation, it did not do so as it was of the opinion that there would not be a fair hearing as the second revocation was politically motivated and done in bad faith. It was the appellant's contention that the Minister of Resource Planning that the second revocation amounted to misfeasance in public office. Further the appellant had contended that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;51A.;;">s 51A of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> was unconstitutional as it contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Subsequent to the second revocation, the licensed area of the licence was divided up into four parts and licences were issued to three other companies, including PPES Resorts Sdn Bhd which is a company owned by the Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In view of the second revocation, the appellant filed this suit to seek for declaratory reliefs in respect of the two revocations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned High Court Judge came to his decision based on his findings on the following issues:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Having perused the memorandum of appeal and the submissions made by respective counsel, it was our view that this appeal can be dealt with by deliberating on the same issues as was done by the learned judge but of course in the capacity as an appellate tribunal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Court Analysis</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether The Appellant's Claim In Respect Of The First Revocation Is Statute-Barred By Reason Of The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;;">Public Authorities Protection Act 1948 ('PAPA')</LINK> And/Or The Provisions Of The Sarawak Limitation Ordinance?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> To recap, the appellant's cause of action concerned the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's alleged tort of public misfeasance in public office and also for the breach of contract in terminating the licence without the requisite three months' notice. The undisputed revocation date for the first revocation is the date of the letter issued by DW7 (the Director of Forests) which was 11 March 1987. The other date of significance is the date of filing this suit and that was 31 July 1990. The respondents relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">s 2(a) Public Authorities Protection Act 1948 (PAPA)</LINK> which stipulates that any action against any person exercising a public duty must be done within 36 months from the date of the act complained of or, in the case of a continuance of injury or damage, within 36 months next after the ceasing thereof. Item 19 of the Limitation Ordinance (Sarawak) (Cap 49) was also relied upon by the respondents as that item provides that a limitation period of two years for suit claiming for compensation for any malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance, independent of contract and such period to commence from the act of misfeasance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Applying the facts to the law, the respondents submitted that the relief in respect of the first revocation is time-barred by some four months.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In rebuttal, the appellant submitted that there was a continuing breach on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent when the appellant was prevented from entering the area after its victory in the earlier suit in the High Court. The proper date for the limitation period to run was thus on 10 August 1987 which was the date in which the High Court quashed the first revocation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned judge sustained the contention of the respondents and this is what he said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We have no reason to disagree with the learned judge for the simple reason he had applied the facts and the law correctly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As for the cause of action on contract, the learned judge held that this claim cannot be sustained as the appellant had breached the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;;">Forests Ordinance</LINK> when he was dealing with issue 2.2. Similarly we will discuss the learned judge's grounds when we deal with issue 2.2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 2.1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether There Had Been Breach Or Contravention Of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">Section 2(2) Of The Forests Ordinance</LINK> By The Appellant In Having Allowed Its Controlling Shares To Be Transferred Without Authorisation Of The Director Of Forests Or A Person Authorised By Him In That Behalf ?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In dealing with this issue the learned judge had made certain findings of law and they are these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We had carefully considered the analysis of the learned judge's rulings and are of the view that he had applied the law to the undisputed facts correctly and he had given credible reasons for his decision. We also feel that there is no necessity for us to set out those reasons in this judgment as it would be an exercise in verbosity and duplicity. The reasons of the learned High Court Judge are found at pp 85 to 96 of Part A of the Record of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The remaining subsidiary issues dealt by the learned judge are the allegation of a general plan and oral agreement by the appellant through Tun Abdul Rahman and the consent for the transfer of shares given by STIDC via a letter dated 1 October 1985. As these two issues concerned appreciation of testimonies of witnesses plus the fact that one of main ground of the appeal was that the learned judge failed to properly appreciate the totality of the oral and documentary evidence before him, we deem it fit to spend some time on these two issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It was the contention of the appellant that there was no breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> as the transfer of shares to Solana Sdn Bhd was done pursuant a general plan to assist charitable bodies or organisations, individuals and the local inhabitants, namely the Orang Ulu of the Baram area and that general plan formed part of the oral agreement with the then Minister of Finance representing himself, 1<sup>st</sup> respondent and 3<sup>rd</sup> respondent, when he approved the licence to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Before we analyse the learned judge's analysis of the evidence, we should mention that learned counsel for the appellant from the outset of his submission contended that the learned judge had erred when he failed to appreciate that the respondents' case suffered a fatal flaw in not calling the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent as a witness to rebut the evidence of the appellants' witnesses. To support his contention, learned counsel relied heavily on the Federal Court's judgment of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_74;"><i>Takako Sakao v. Ng Pek Yuen &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 74</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 751; [2010] 1 CLJ 381.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The paragraphs of the judgment in <i>Takako Sakao (supra)</i> which learned counsel for the appellant relied on were these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Applying the dicta from the Federal Court, learned counsel for the appellant submitted as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Let us at this juncture say that this court is duty bound to follow the decisions of the apex court. Hence the only task which befalls unto us is simply to examine and determine whether the learned judge had failed to follow the dicta of the apex court of the land which we do so now.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We start our deliberation by looking at the facts of <i>Takako</i> case which concerns a claim by the appellant there for part ownership of a property registered in the name of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent there. The claim was premised on the concept of trust. The appellant and the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent there were in partnership in a restaurant and they decided to purchase a property to operate the restaurant business. The appellant had provided a sum of RM194,610.00 for the purchase of the property, the consideration of which was in the sum of RM950,000.00. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent registered the property in her name and then sold to a company owned by the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent who was the husband of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent. In the trial only the appellant gave evidence as to how the property was purchased. In short the appellant's evidence was simply that there was an understanding between the parties that the property was to be owned jointly. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent chose not to give evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The Federal Court in view of the lack of evidence to rebut the appellant's evidence held that judgment should have been given to the appellant. The Federal Court in coming to its decision relied on the case of <i>Wasakah Singh v. Bachan Singh</i> [1931] 1 MC 125 and quoted with approval the dicta of Elphinstone CJ. If one looks at that quotation carefully, the learned Chief Justice talks of evidence which 'if it is believed'. What we take that to mean is simply the evidence of the appellant must reached a level that is to be believed. If the evidence of the appellant through cross-examination by the respondents' counsel is devalued so to speak or not reached a level to be believed, then the trial judge is entitled to conclude that the appellant had not proved its case requiring the respondents to rebut. The burden of proof had not shifted at the end of the appellant's case at trial. That is what happened in the trial court here. The learned judge actually was very mindful of the principle of Takako case and this is evident when in his grounds made he said as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Our view is fortified by the recent decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_526;"><i>Solid Investments Ltd v. Alcatel-Lucent (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 526</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 785; [2014] 3 CLJ 73; [2014] 1 AMR 348 where the Federal Court faced with the proposition of Takako case said as follows:</p>
    <p>Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that based on the plaintiff 's evidence the learned trial judge found it was sufficient to shift the legal burden to the defendant. The defendant elected not to lead any evidence to rebut the case of the appellant and took the position that there was no case to answer. Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that it was on that basis, and by reference to the applicable legal principles that the trial judge found as he did. It was therefore contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the Court of Appeal had misdirected itself when it failed to appreciate the significance of the election on the part of the defendant. In other words, the Court of Appeal did not apply the law as stated in <i>Takako Sakao v. Ng Pek Yuen &amp; Anor</i> ...</p>
    <p>In the instant case the notes of proceeding showed that the defendant did take part in the trial. The plaintiff 's sole witness was thoroughly cross-examined by the defence counsel. The trial went on and at the close of the plaintiff 's case the defendant's counsel sought an adjournment to another date for the defendant's witness to attend. The learned trial judge refused the adjournment and the case was therefore closed without the defence offering any evidence. In our view the facts of this case can be distinguished from the facts in <i>Takako Sakao</i>.</p>
    <p>In our view the question of whether the parties were in accounting relationship involved a mixed question of fact and law. In its judgment the Court of Appeal had extensively dealt with the law relating to the duty to account under the common law. Having carefully considered the authorities on this issue the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that on the evidence adduced by the plaintiff at the trial it was not sufficient in law to establish the case for duty to account. The Court of Appeal therefore did not interfere with the determination of fact by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge's decision on this issue was reversed on a point of law and as such we agree with the submission of learned counsel for the defendant that the principles in <i>Takako Sakao</i> did not apply under the circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It is our considered view that the Federal Court in <i>Solid Investments Ltd (supra)</i> had opined the principle in Takako Sakao case is subject to the plaintiff at the end of his or her case having overcome the burden of having proved a <i>prima facie</i> case and failing which the court is not required to enter judgment for the plaintiff should the defendant elect not to give any evidence. With that we move to the next area.</p>
    <p>
      <b>General Plan And Oral Agreement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It is quite clear from the evidence in court that the foundation of the appellant's case is premised on the testimonial evidence of Tun Abdul Rahman which was this. With the purpose of assisting charitable bodies and the local natives economically, he devised a general plan of utilising the revenue from the timber resources of the state by applying from the State Government a Forest Licence to extracts timbers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> This intention according to Tun Abdul Rahman was formed prior to his Chief Ministership from 7 July 1970 till 26 March 1981 and was discussed with the Supreme Council or State Cabinet on at least four occasions, which endorsed the general plan. This general plan according to him was discussed and made known to Datuk Nor Tahir the then Minister of Forestry, the STIDC Board (of which he was Chairman while he was the Chief Minister), the then Director of Forests one Mr Joseph Yong who was a member of the STIDC Board, to persons in BINA, the Lembaga Kebajikan Melayu Miri, the Sibu mosque and some prominent Orang Ulu leaders in the Baram and Belaga area of Sarawak. And prior to his stepping down from his post as Chief Minister, he also said that he briefed the present Chief Minister about the general plan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The area of the timber lands for the timber licence had been discussed and agreed by the then Minister of Forestry Datuk Nor Tahir. The implementation of his general plan was then left to Datuk Nor Tahir, Datuk Kamal (PW4), Norlia Abdul Rahman (PW5), Haji Deli (PW1) and others.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> To give credence to the evidence of Tun Abdul Rahman, Datuk Kamal Hussain (PW4) and Norlia Abdul Rahman (PW5) testified in court. As far as PW4's evidence was concerned, he related the instructions given by Tun Abdul Rahman to him in the presence of Datuk Nor Tahir to provide names of the three companies for the issuance of the timber licence. Those three companies were Keruntum Sdn Bhd (which was granted a timber licence for the Baram area), Toucanet Sdn Bhd and Ketakung Sdn Bhd (which were granted timber licences in the Belaga area).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As for Norlia Abdul Rahman (PW5) it is her evidence that to implement the general plan as devised by Tun Abdul Rahman, she prepared and issued the circular resolutions of the plaintiff dated 14 December 1983 to transfer Datuk Deli's and Haji Louise Ali's shares to Solana Sdn Bhd and allot the controlling shares in the plaintiff to the following three parties:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The learned judge after minutely examining the evidence of the appellant's witnesses found that 'at best the general plan was a personal initiative of Tun Abdul Rahman (PW9) to which the Government was not a party'. The learned judge gave seven broad grounds for his conclusion which can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We now examine the judge's reasoning for the above grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reason 1 - Failure To Plead At The Earliest Opportunity</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The relevant pleading in respect of the general plan is set out in para 2(c) (iv) of its amended reply dated 18 May 1994 which read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The respondents had on 18 September 1990 filed an amended defence and in para 1.6 had contended that the appellant had "unlawfully and without authorisation, express or implied, issued and allotted or caused to be transferred" in the appellant. A reply to the amended defence was filed by the respondents on 22 September 1990.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> From the amended reply dated 18 May 1994, it mentioned the then Minister of Forest, one Datuk Nor Tahir, was fully aware of this general plan. Datuk Nor Tahir passed away on 27 November 1990 which meant that the appellant could have easily obtained a statement from him prior to the filing of the reply dated 22 September 1990. But no statement was obtained and hence no mention of the general plan in that reply and took four years after the death of Datuk Nor Tahir to plead this general plan in the amended reply dated 18 May 1994.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> We have no doubt in our mind that this contention of a 'general plan' forms a substantial and crucial part of the appellant's case. It could be said that its case succeeds or fails by that contention. That being the case, we find it incredulous that the appellant never pleaded it at the earliest opportunity in September 1990 where in fact the respondents in their defence had contended that the appellant had breached the law. It begs the question why did the appellant wait for almost four years after the death of Datuk Nor Tahir to make this allegation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Furthermore, Tun Abdul Rahman had testified that this general plan had been discussed in at least four cabinet meeting and the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent was fully aware of the oral agreement between Datuk Nor Tahir and Tun Abdul Rahman on the general plan. Hence we find that it is not reasonable that the appellant did not raise or disclose this in its pleading in September 1990 or even earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> It is also not disputed that the appellant had been asked by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent to show cause why its licence should not be cancelled for continued breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK>. Not only that, the appellant had also written to the Director of Forests and STIDC for consent for the transfer of shares. What that means that the appellant had several opportunities to make this allegation but it did not.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We also see no explanation for this delay in making this allegation from the appellant in the cold prints of the record of appeal. This lack of explanation with respect can only lead to one conclusion and that is this allegation remains nothing more than a mere allegation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reason 2 - Conduct Of The Then Minister Of Forest As Chairman Of STIDC Is Inconsistent To The Existence Of This General Plan</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> As the Minister of Forest, Datuk Nor Tahir also headed the board of management of STIDC. If what was alleged were true, there was no reason for Datuk Nor Tahir, in dealing with the appellant's application for consent for the transfer of shares, not to inform the agreement he had made with Tun Abdul Rahman with the knowledge of the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reason 3 - Evidence Of Haji Deli (PW1)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> It is the case of the appellant that the oral agreement and understanding was required by the Minister of Forest and it was on that basis that the licence was issued to the appellant. Haji Deli was alleged to be present when the licence was issued to the appellant and hence supposedly to be in the know of the oral agreement. His testimony pointed to the contrary which is evident from this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This evidence remained as spoken above, as no attempt was made to clarify in re-examination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reason 4 - Solana Sdn Bhd The Biggest Shareholder In The Appellant Was Not In Existence When The Licence Was Issued On 19 July 1983</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> It was the appellant's case that the exercise in the transfer of shares in the appellant company as set out earlier was made premised on the oral agreement and understanding of the Minister Datuk Nor Tahir when he considered and approved the plaintiff 's application for timber licence. The learned judge found this cannot be true and correctly so for the simple reason that on 14 December 1983 when Solana Sdn Bhd became the largest shareholder in the appellant, it did not exist on 22 July 1983 when the Minister of Forestry Datuk Nor Tahir approved the appellant's application as it was only incorporated on 24 November 1983. It is also part of the evidence of the appellant through Lucy Lao Puong Siong (PW2) and PW5 that at no time was the Minister of Forestry was made aware of the pending incorporation of Solana Sdn Bhd or even thereafter. This showed conclusively that the general plan and the oral agreement were not in anyone's mind.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reason 5 - General Plan Was A Private Initiative Of Tun Abdul Rahman</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The learned judge again gave various reasons for his conclusion and they were basically these. The general plan for charitable bodies during Tun Abdul Rahman's tenure as Chief Minister was done through the legislative assembly pursuant to legislations resulting to the setting up of Yayasan Sarawak and Sarawak Foundation Fund. Further during the tenure of the Tun Abdul Rahman's ministership as Chief Minister cum Minister of Forestry there was no evidence of setting up of a general plan for the benefit of the natives.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> Of immense significance is the learned judge's conclusion that even if there was a general plan, the appellant still had to comply with the legal requirement set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> which by the evidence of Tun Abdul Rahman himself the appellant's licence is regulated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">s 2(2) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK>. And as pointed out above, there was non-compliance to the aforesaid section and hence we agree with the learned judge, the defence of a general plan does not assist the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 2.2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>If There Was Such Breach, Whether The Licence Was Rendered Invalid And/Or Tainted With Illegality?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> The learned judge answered in the affirmative and in our view for the correct reason. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_126;2.;;">Section 2(2) of the Forests Ordinance</LINK> expressly prohibits any transfer without the consent of the Director of Forestry and non-compliance of the same tantamounts to an illegal act which no court would allow any litigant to premise its cause of action on. The Forests Ordinance is a piece of legislation aimed at protecting the natural resources of the State with the aim of ensuring that the resources are properly nurtured and maintained. Hence it is in our view that public policy dictates the courts to deem that the appellant cannot premise its action on a licence tainted with illegality.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 3.1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether The First And Second Revocations Were Unlawful Or Contrary To Law And Should Be Set Aside?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The appellant on this issue relied on following factors. There was no oral hearing conducted prior to the second revocation. The decision was irrational and unreasonable in the circumstances. The decision is disproportionate or offended the principles of fairness. The decision was motivated by malice which amounted to public misfeasance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The learned judge in his grounds dealt with all the points raised in great details. We examined the manners in which the learned judge dealt with the points and found that he had applied the correct principle of law to the factual matrix correctly and we find no error in his grounds. Not only that, if we were to summarise his reasoning we may be doing a disservice to his well-crafted and reasoned judgment. Further and in any event, they were all findings of fact by the learned judge and as appellate court, the salutary rule is clear and that is there is no appellate interference unless it can be shown that these findings were perverse in that they were not premised on established evidence. That is not surely the case here. The learned judge examined every contention of law and facts raised by the appellant and answered them. Hence we concur with the decision of the learned judge. The reasons of the learned High Court Judge are found at pp 131 to 158 of Part A of the Record of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 3.2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Was The Revocation Of The Plaintiff's Timber Licence Done To Serve A Political Purpose?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> From the evidence and submission of the appellant, it can be said that this contention was premised on the so called "Ming Court" affair and the manner in which the appellant's timber licence was cancelled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The Ming Court affair concerned a move to get 28 State Assemblymen to cross the floor of the State Assembly in an attempt to remove the Chief Minister of the day namely the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. A press conference by the group of politician opposed to the Chief Minister was held on 9 March 1987. On 10 March 1987, there was a press report which carried the headline "Taib lashes out at "wealth for power" attempts to destabilise and grab power". On the same day, there was a meeting between the Chief Minister, Datuk Leo Chai (DW7), Haji Abdillah (DW9) and the then State Attorney General to discuss the termination of timber licences. On 11 March 1987, there was another press report quoting the Chief Minister saying he was watching the use of timber money to destabilise the State Government. It was under this backdrop that on 11 March 1987 the appellant's licence together with 25 other licences were revoked. Hence, it was the contention of the appellant that the revocation of the appellant's timber licence was done for political purpose and done hurriedly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The learned judge did not accept the contention and in our view correct not to do so. The burden of proof is on the one who alleges and here the appellant carried that burden. It can be said that the appellant was alleging that the sole reason for the cancellation of licences was to punish those who opposed the Chief Minister. However there are evidence which point to the contrary. PW1 (Haji Deli) who is a self-confessed supporter of the move to oppose the Chief Minister and was involved in the Ming Court affair conceded that the company related to him did not have his License cancelled. That company is Usama Logging Sdn Bhd and it was asked directly to him during cross-examination whether the licence of Usama was cancelled to which he said no.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> There is also no direct evidence in court that the Chief Minister knew about the Ming Court meeting prior to the cancellation of the appellant's licence and to link the aforesaid cancellation to a political motive is mere conjecture. Further the 10 March 1987 meeting which cancelled the appellant's licence and 25 others were to discuss a list of timber licenceses whose shares have been transferred prepared by civil servants in the then Director of Forests (DW7) and Haji Abdillah (DW9). Again there is no evidence to show that these two persons knew that the alleged political motive behind the preparation of the list. Though their evidence were attacked by learned counsel for the appellant, the learned judge had in our view given reasons why they are reliable witnesses despite some inconsistencies in their evidence. It is trite law that minor inconsistency in evidence does not make the other evidence unbelievable. In this case, the learned judge analysed the inconsistencies and found them not to be serious inconsistencies. We see no error in his conclusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> One of the reasons relied by the learned judge for his decision was that the allegation of political motive was not referred at the earliest opportunity. In the words of the learned judge, he states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> We see merits in the reasoning of the learned judge. Hence we see no reasons to depart from the findings of the learned judge.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The learned judge did not consider this issue as learned counsel for the appellant intimates to the learned judge that his decision can be made without recourse to the constitutional contention proffered.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> This is an appeal mainly on findings of facts by the trial judge who naturally had the benefit of hearing testimonies and observing the demeanours of the witnesses. This benefit should not be overlooked by an appellate tribunal. Unless and until the appellate tribunal is shown by the appellant that the learned judge had made findings which no reasonable tribunal would have made, there should be no disturbance of the findings of the trial court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> This is also a case where the trial judge had dealt with every points raised by the appellant and gave credible reasons for his conclusions. We have looked at those reasons and as stated above, we have not found any appealable errors on part of the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> Accordingly we dismissed the appeal with costs to the respondents in the sum of RM30,000.00. We also ordered that the deposit is to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
