    <p>The appellant ('Dream Property') purchased a piece of land from the respondent ('Atlas Housing') under a sale and purchase agreement ('SPA') in 2004 for RM33.5 million intending to build a commercial complex on the land which later became known as the Batu Pahat Mall. Dream Property paid a 10% deposit of RM3.35, million leaving a balance of RM30.15 million payable within four months from the delivery of vacant possession with an automatic extension of two months under the SPA. Dream Property was allowed immediate access to the land and the right to commence construction works upon execution of the SPA. In addition, Atlas granted a Power of Attorney ('PA') in favour of Dream Property to enable Dream Property to sign, execute and do any acts, deeds and things connected with and in relation to the land and the buildings to be erected thereon as a registered owner could. Prior to the execution of the SPA, there were 40 squatters and a school on the land. It was agreed that Atlas Housing would only hand over vacant possession after clearing the squatters and relocating the school within the time period provided under the SPA. The squatters were duly evicted from the land by 21 November 2005 but the date on which the school was relocated for vacant possession purposes was disputed. Atlas Housing contended that vacant possession was delivered on 21 November 2005 when a joint inspection by both parties took place, whereas Dream Property contended that it was delivered on 28 February 2006 when it received the keys to the school. The parties then filed interlocutory applications in court to determine the issues which went all the way up to the Federal Court. The Federal Court ordered the matter remitted to the High Court for a full trial. Before the High Court trial was concluded, the Batu Pahat Mall was completed and fully operational with ongoing businesses and tenants. The High Court, after full trial, allowed Atlas Housing's claim for vacant possession, ordering amongst others, (i) that the land together with the Batu Pahat Mall be returned to Atlas Housing; (ii) that Dream Property account for profits made to Atlas Housing; and (iii) that costs of the construction of the Batu Pahat Mall incurred by Dream Property should be paid by Atlas Housing. Dream Property appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed the appeal by way of a majority judgment. The majority of the Court of Appeal however clarified that Dream Property was only to pay profits derived from its use and occupation of the land. Dream Property now appealed to the Federal Court. The issues herein were: (1) whether the SPA was validly terminated by Atlas Housing; (2) whether Atlas Housing was unjustly enriched by the construction of the Batu Pahat Mall; and (3) whether it was fair and equitable for Dream Property to be awarded only the costs of construction of the Batu Pahat Mall.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal in part:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The date of delivery of vacant possession of the land was critical for the purposes of determining the date when the balance purchase price of RM30.15 million became payable. On 22 November 2005 Atlas Housing wrote to Dream Property about the joint viewing of the site by both parties that had taken place on 21 November 2005 confirming the eviction of all the squatters and the relocation of the school. Dream Property replied agreeing that the school was relocated and the completion date being 21 March 2006 with the extended completion date being 21 May 2006. That letter pointed to a very different picture from Dream Property's current position. In relying, amongst others, on that letter to conclude that vacant possession was delivered on 21 November 2005, the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal applied the correct approach in testing the veracity of oral evidence by reference to the contemporary documentary evidence. (paras 56-61)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Dream Property attempted to unilaterally introduce a new term of "quiet possession" in the SPA. There was nothing in the SPA that obliged Atlas Housing to give a guarantee or warranty of "quiet possession". A party to a contract could not <i>ex post facto</i> seek to introduce a new term into the contract which was altogether outside the contract. Further, Dream Property did not at the material time write to Atlas Housing complaining of "lack of quiet possession". There was no evidence that Atlas Housing or the school authority preventing Dream Property from entering the land after the joint inspection on 21 November 2005. Moreover, there was no evidence that there was any interference with Dream Property's use and enjoyment of the land after 21 November 2005. As at 21 November 2005, Dream Property was already in occupation of 95% of the land. Dream Property had in fact free access in and out of the land and the school since 21 November 2005. Vacant possession was therefore delivered by Atlas Housing on 21 November 2005. (paras 64-68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Dream Property breached the SPA by failing to pay the balance purchase price by the extended completion date of 21 May 2006. The obligation to pay the purchase price was a fundamental obligation of the SPA. The failure to pay the balance purchase went to the root of the SPA thereby rendering the SPA terminated. The failure on Dream Property's part to pay the balance purchase price by the completion date of 21 May 2006 brought into operation cl 12 of the SPA. Clause 12 expressly provided that "the contract shall be treated as null and void and of no further effect". The contractual language being clear, plain, explicit and unambiguous must be given a literal meaning. The immediate consequence of the termination meant that automatic termination was intended by the parties when they mutually agreed to be bound by the SPA. Clause 12 provided for the automatic termination upon Dream Property's failure to pay the balance purchase price within the stipulated time period. There was no requirement for a notice of termination to be issued by Atlas Housing to Dream Property. (paras 69-76)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The case of <i>P Palakrishnan Perianan v. Krishnamoorthy Sinniah &amp; Anor</i> was decided <i>per incuriam</i> as it did not consider the Court of Appeal case of <i>Kredin Sdn Bhd v. YTF Investments Sdn Bhd</i> which upheld the enforceability of the automatic termination clause in the context of a sale and purchase agreement. There could be no question as to the enforceability of the automatic termination clause in the SPA in the present case under Malaysian contract law. (para 78)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The question of whether cl 12 was void pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;40.;;">s 40 of the Contracts Act 1950 ('Act')</LINK> raised the important question of whether the parties might contract out of the Act. The clear wordings of cl 12 showed that the parties to the SPA agreed to waive the requirement for notice of termination upon breach of the SPA. Clause 12 expressly provided that the SPA "shall be treated as null and void and of no further effect upon the non-payment of the balance purchase price within the stipulated time period". The enforceability of cl 12 was not open to challenge. Notwithstanding, Atlas Housing in a letter dated 9 March 2006 informed Dream Property of the consequential termination if Dream Property failed to pay the balance purchase price within the time period. The letter of 9 March 2006 and Atlas Housing's conduct on 28 August 2006 in filing this action provided compelling evidence that Atlas Housing treated the SPA as having been terminated after the relevant time period. (paras 80-84)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Atlas Housing's act of accepting RM5.15 million three months after the expiry of the SPA did not mean that time was not of the essence in making payment for the balance purchase price or that it revived the SPA. There was more than sufficient admissible evidence to support the High Court's findings that Atlas Housing did not accept the payment. Dream Property knew at all material times that the RM5.15 million was being retained by Atlas Housing as security for damages pending the court order concerned. When the order was set aside, the Atlas Housing sought to return the sum but Dream Property refused to accept it. In that way, no waiver was possible and Dream Property could not contend that Atlas Housing accepted the payment. Dream Property could not take advantage of its refusal in taking back the sum. A contract terminated could not remain in a "frozen" state for some event to happen to keep it alive. As Dream Property only paid 10% deposit of the purchase price and failed to pay the balance within the stipulated time under the SPA, Atlas Housing validly terminated the SPA. (paras 89-93)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> Atlas Housing was aware that Dream Property wanted to buy the land for the purpose of constructing and completing the Batu Pahat Mall for business before the Chinese New Year of 2007. Dream Property's right to commence, continue and complete the construction of the Batu Pahat Mall on the land was independent of the delivery of vacant possession of the land. Despite the on-going litigation between the parties, Dream Property continued with the construction of the Batu Pahat Mall as it took the position that it was entitled to do so under the SPA and the PA. Atlas Housing did not seek an interim injunctive relief to restrain Dream Property from carrying on with the construction before or after the completion date of the SPA on 21 March 2006. When the High Court delivered its decision on 11 November 2011, the Batu Pahat Mall was fully operational for about five years since its completion in early January 2007. As such, the remedy awarded to Dream Property should be the full market value of the Batu Pahat Mall and not just the costs of its construction. (paras 96, 98 &amp; 159)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Dream Property was required to return to Atlas Housing not just the land sold but an enormously enhanced and improved asset in the form of a business mall with monetary value. The Batu Pahat Mall was a thriving mall with an occupancy rate of more than 80% tenanted with over 250 retail outlets operating since its completion in December 2006. The market value of the mall far exceeded the value of the land. If it were to be sold to a third party, the unjust enrichment and undue benefit accrued to Atlas Housing would be enormous. The land if left empty or vacant would not have appreciated considerably. Atlas Housing unquestionably benefited even though it did not request for the Mall to be constructed. But it must be understood that the mall was not constructed and maintained by Dream Property to benefit Atlas Housing gratuitously. Atlas Housing too did not seek the aid of the court to pull down the Batu Pahat Mall. Atlas Housing would indisputably have the benefit of a completely constructed mall. (paras 121-123)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> Dream Property did not only construct a building or merely construct a property on land but built and continued to build an entire enterprise, brand name and goodwill of the Batu Pahat Mall. Dream Property's <i>bona fide</i> improvement and enhancement of the land were all done entirely through its sole act, effort and costs. By reason thereof, the land had substantially enhanced in value. Since the PA was not terminated, the construction of the Batu Pahat Mall was lawful. Dream Property had a legal right to continue the construction pending the final determination of the suit herein in the High Court. Moreover, apart from issuing one letter to ask Dream Property to cease all construction work on the land, Atlas Housing took no other action to stop Dream Property from constructing on the land. Neither did it take any steps to revoke the PA given to Dream Property. (paras 124-125)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> Dream Property embarked upon the promotion of the mall and was responsible for the overall running, upkeep and maintenance of the building, road and infrastructure as well as the general administration of the mall. Dream Property expended time, effort and expertise all at its own costs in establishing and maintaining the Batu Pahat Mall to the stature and success it had become. That involved extensive and continuous marketing and promotional strategies. The enrichment or benefit of Atlas Housing was undoubtedly at the expense of Dream Property. (paras 126-127)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> Atlas Housing could escape restitutionary liability by showing that there was a legal ground for receiving an enormously enhanced and improved asset. Notably, Dream Property was not required to benefit Atlas Housing by legislation or contract. The reason why there was liability in the circumstances was that Atlas Housing's enrichment was unjustified and there was no legal ground for it to claim and enjoy the full commercial value of the Batu Pahat Mall. As such, Dream Property had a <i>prima facie</i> right to restitution. On the facts, injustice occurred to such an extent that Dream Property not only suffered loss but Atlas Housing was made richer by the loss. The injustice at Dream Property's expense was central to the foundation of the relief of restitution based on the law of unjust enrichment. Atlas Housing should not be allowed to reap the windfall at the expense of Dream Property. Dream Property lawfully constructed the Batu Pahat Mall on the land not intending to do so gratuitously with Atlas Housing enjoying the benefit. On that basis, judicial intervention was warranted. Dream Property had made out a cause of action in unjust enrichment in that Atlas Housing was enriched, the enrichment was gained at the expense of Dream Property, and the enrichment was unjust. (paras 129-131)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> The High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to judicially appreciate that the amount of unjust enrichment gained by Atlas Housing was the ultimate value of the land as a result of Dream Property's improvement and enhancement. They failed to properly and judicially appreciate that the amount of unjust enrichment was not the mere costs of constructing the shopping mall but the value of the enhancement or enrichment of the land with it having ongoing businesses, goodwill and brand name. By reason thereof, it remained manifestly unfair and unjust for Atlas Housing to be enriched to the extent of the full commercial value of the mall, while having only to pay for the costs of its physical construction to Dream Property. Dream Property was therefore entitled to a monetary award in the sum equivalent to the current market value of the mall excluding the market value of the land without the mall. After paying the said monetary sum to Dream Property, Atlas Housing would, from then on, enjoy the full benefit of a completely constructed mall on the land having a freehold title. That would unquestionably place Atlas Housing in a far better position than it would have been had it not entered into the SPA. (paras 135-136)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(13)</b> The present case revolved around an alleged breach of contract and was purely a commercial undertaking common in the business world. Hence, the principle under which the order or relief was made in the <i>Attorney General v. Blake</i> case was inapplicable to the facts of this case. For that reason, the majority of the Court of Appeal fell into error in applying that case in making an order for an account of profits in favour of Atlas Housing. Likewise, the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in failing to recognise that to make an order for an account of profits, it would have to be shown by Atlas Housing that the profits were brought about by breach of contract. Dream Property would have made those profits had it paid the balance purchase price in time. They were not net profits gained by the breach of contract. There was therefore no justification in law or equity to grant the order for an account of profits against Dream Property. (paras 143-144)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(14)</b> As the construction of the Batu Pahat Mall was lawful, Dream Property was in possession of a beneficial interest on the land capable of registration until the validity of the termination of the SPA was settled. Dream Property was therefore not a trespasser. (paras 145-146)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(15)</b> There was no fiduciary relationship between the parties. An order to account for profits was contrary to established principles of law that the said relief would only be awarded in instances where it was established that there was a breach of fiduciary duty. That point was ignored by the majority of the Court of Appeal. (paras 151-153)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(16)</b> Dream Property would not have expended large sums of money in improving the land had it known that it did not have a good title to the land. In the circumstances, Atlas Housing was only entitled to the market rent of the unimproved land and not for an account of profits as held by <i>Attorney General v. Blake</i>. (para 158)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Azahar Mohamed FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal from the whole of the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal that upheld the judgment of the High Court after a full trial of the matter that arose out of a contractual dispute. This appeal also raises the important question of restitutionary remedy and the law of unjust enrichment, originally also called the law of restitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We will describe the parties in this judgment as they appear in the High Court, namely the appellant as the defendant and the respondent as the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The subject matter of the dispute between the parties revolved around the termination of a sale and purchase agreement for a parcel of land ("the land"), where the registered proprietor Atlas Housing Sdn Bhd ("the plaintiff ") was the vendor and Dream Property Sdn Bhd ("the defendant") was the purchaser. By a sale and purchase agreement dated 19 November 2004 ("the SPA"), the defendant agreed to purchase the land measuring approximately 14.4 acres and known as Grant No 101840 Lot 325 Mukim Simpang Kanan in Batu Pahat, Johor at the price of RM33.5 million from the plaintiff with the plan of developing it into a commercial complex. A fully functioning completed commercial complex, with ongoing businesses and tenants now stands on the land, which, at this time is known as Batu Pahat Mall ("the mall"). In November 2007, the market value of the mall was estimated to be in the region of RM387 million.</p>
    <p>
      <b>An Overview Of The Dispute</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff brought an action in the High Court at Johore Bahru against the defendant to recover vacant possession of the land. In essence, the plaintiff's claim was for breach of contract by the defendant resulting in its termination and entitling the plaintiff to the return of the land as well as compensation for the loss suffered from the defendant's breach. The defendant resisted the action and made a counterclaim for specific performance and other reliefs. At the time of filing the writ in 2006, the defendant had already begun construction works on the land to build the mall. Construction proceeded notwithstanding the court action and proceedings. By the time the trial before the High Court was concluded, the mall stood completed on the land and had been fully operational since the end of 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The judgment of the High Court was delivered on 11 November 2011 wherein it was held that the defendant had breached the SPA resulting in its termination. The High Court ordered, among others, that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Subsequently, the defendant filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal against the whole of the High Court judgment. At the same time, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Cross Appeal. On 10 May 2013, the Court of Appeal by way of a majority judgment, dismissed the defendant's appeal with costs. The plaintiff's cross appeal was also dismissed. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the orders of the trial judge as set out above. However, the majority clarified the order relating to the account of profits ordered by the High Court and ruled that the defendant was only to pay the profits derived from its use and occupation of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Aggrieved by the majority judgment of the Court Of Appeal, the defendant applied for leave to appeal to the Federal Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> and on 20 February 2014, this court granted leave to appeal to the defendant in respect of eleven questions of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The matter in dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant has had a convoluted history. It is important therefore to set out in some detail the material background facts and events leading to the dispute as well as the chronology of the relevant court proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the defendant paid the 10% deposit of RM3.35 million leaving a balance of RM30.15 million payable in four months from the date the plaintiff as the vendor confirms that vacant possession is ready to be delivered and upon inspection and confirmation by the defendant with automatic extension of two months with interest at 7% pa payable in respect of the extended period. Pursuant to cl 17 of the SPA, time is of the essence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> At the time of the execution of the SPA, the land had forty squatters and a school known as Sekolah Rendah Hwa Nan ("the school") located on it. The school occupied 0.75 acres or about 5% of the total land area. The SPA contains several special conditions and features, among which as provided by Special Condition 4, the defendant was allowed immediate access to the land and the right to commence any construction works on the land upon execution of the SPA. In addition, the plaintiff granted a Power of Attorney (the "PA") dated 19 November 2004 in favour of the defendant, to enable the defendant to sign, execute and do any acts, deeds and things connected with and in relation to the land and the buildings to be erected thereon as a registered owner could.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Special Condition 1 of the SPA expressly states that the plaintiff shall only hand over vacant possession of the land after the clearing of squatters from the land has taken place and the school situated on the land has been relocated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Special Condition 3 of the SPA explicitly provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Before going any further, it is important to note that the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant arose when the handing over of the vacant possession of the entire land by the plaintiff was delayed due to a disagreement in the manner of handing over and/or relocation of the school.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 16 November 2005, Messrs Gan &amp; Tey (the "plaintiff's solicitors") wrote to Messrs Ajmer Sandhu &amp; Ong (the "defendant's solicitors") stating that the plaintiff was ready to hand over vacant possession of the land. The letter also stated that joint inspection of the land would take place on 18 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> On 17 November 2005, the defendant's solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors requesting for the date of joint inspection to be changed to 21 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On 21 November 2005, the defendant's representative, Mr Yiap Toon Cheng ("Mr Yiap") and the plaintiff's representatives, Mr Tang Pei Hau and Mr Edwin Tan jointly inspected the land. Mr Yiap admitted that joint inspection had taken place and wrote (in his own handwriting) on a pre-typed document "I have jointly inspected the school site with Mr Edwin Tan &amp; Mr Tang and confirm that the school administration has been relocated''.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Shortly after that, on 22 November 2005 the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendant's solicitors confirming that the joint inspection of the site had taken place, all the squatters had been evicted, the school relocated and that the completion date would fall on 21 March 2006 with an extension of two months subject to payment of interest at 7% per annum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is important to bear in mind that on 29 November 2005, the defendant's solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors, <i>inter alia</i>, accepting the contents of the letter dated 22 November 2005 provided that the school should not be demolished and the defendant would be allowed to use the school in consideration of the defendant paying RM20,000.00 contribution to the school.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In response to the letter dated 29 November 2005, on 21 December 2005, the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendant's solicitors expressing their agreement to the defendant taking over the school but that the RM20,000.00 was to be treated as the purchase price of the school building and not a donation. It is important to emphasise that the contents of the letter also insisted that this arrangement should not be a condition precedent to the handing over of vacant possession of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On 9 January 2006, the defendant's solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors, among others, requesting written confirmation and/or warranty that with the handing over of vacant possession, the defendant should enjoy quiet possession of the land and there shall be no further interference from the school and squatters in consideration of the defendant's contribution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> From the defendant's point of view, a very important event took place on 28 February 2006. On that date, the plaintiff handed over the keys of the school gates and the school premises by a letter of even date to the defendant. It was also stated in the said letter that the school would then be under the control of the defendant. The contention of the defendant was that by accepting the keys to the school and by subsequently being able to access the whole of the land without hindrance, vacant possession of the land was only delivered to the defendant on 28 February 2006. On the other hand the plaintiff contended that vacant possession took place earlier, ie on 21 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Then problem started brewing. On 8 March 2006, the defendant's solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors disputing the date of the handing over of vacant possession and date of completion. The letter stated that vacant possession of the land was delivered on 28 February 2006 and implying the completion date was on 30 June 2006 with a further two month extension.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It has to be said at this point that there is no dispute that vacant possession was delivered. However, there was a serious dispute as to the date of delivery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On 21 March 2006, the plaintiff's solicitors notified the defendant's solicitors that the extended completion date would commence on 22 March 2006 with late payment interest payable at the rate of 7% per annum until 21 May 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As events unfolded, the defendant's solicitors in its letter dated 22 March 2006 responded to the plaintiff's solicitors asserting that prior to 28 February 2006, the defendant had "never enjoyed quiet possession in actual fact" and the completion period commenced to run only after 28 February 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As the dispute between the parties concerning the completion and extended completion dates could not be resolved, on 21 April 2006 the defendant filed the Johor Bahru High Court Originating Summons No: 24-1418-2006 ("the OS") for specific performance and for among others, a declaration regarding the vacant possession of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> On 30 June 2006, Eon Bank Berhad approved the defendant's application for banking facilities in the form of an overdraft in the sum of RM5 million and a term loan in the sum of RM100 million out of which a sum of RM25 million was to part finance the purchase of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Following the approval of the banking facilities, on 21 August 2006, Messrs Sharizat Rashid &amp; Lee, solicitors for Eon Bank Berhad, wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors informing them that Eon Bank Berhad had conditionally granted the defendant a loan facility of RM25 million to enable them to complete the purchase of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The following day on 22 August 2006, the defendant's solicitors forwarded a bank draft for the sum of RM5.15 million, being the differential sum of the purchase price and the loan to the plaintiff's solicitors. It is to be noted that this payment of RM5.15 million was still more than RM25 million short of the balance purchase price of RM30.15 million plus late payment interest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On 25 August 2006 and 29 August 2006, the defendant's solicitors wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors requesting for, among others, the title deed of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Meanwhile, on 28 August 2006, the plaintiff commenced the suit herein by filing a writ of summons in the Johor Bahru High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The plaintiff's solicitors then wrote to the defendant's solicitors on 2 September 2006 stating that the extended completion date had expired on 21 May 2006 and that the 10% deposit was forfeited and demanded that vacant possession of the land be redelivered to the plaintiff without delay.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> On 8 September 2006, the plaintiff filed their statement of claim against the defendant (which was amended on 8 September 2010) where, among others, the plaintiff sought an order that vacant possession of the land be returned to the plaintiff. The defendant then filed the amended counterclaim where, among others, the defendant sought a declaration that the true date of delivery of vacant possession of the land was 28 February 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> On 12 September 2006, the plaintiff commenced proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14.;;">O 14A of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (the "O 14A application")</LINK> for a declaration of the date of vacant possession under the SPA. The High Court allowed the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14.;;">O 14A Application</LINK> on 10 October 2006. The defendant's OS was accordingly struck off on 17 November 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Next, on 19 October 2006, the defendant filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal with regards to the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14.;;">O 14A application</LINK>. On 2 November 2007, the Court of Appeal by majority judgment dismissed the defendant's appeal with regards to the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14.;;">O 14A application</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> On 5 September 2008, the Federal Court granted leave to the defendant to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal. On 8 June 2010, the Federal Court set aside the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal as well as the orders made by the High Court in the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14.;;">O 14A application</LINK>. The Federal Court ordered that the matter be remitted to the High Court for a full trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The trial of the Suit herein in the High Court commenced on 16 February 2011 and concluded on 1 June 2011. As mentioned earlier, the decision of the High Court was delivered on 11 November 2011 allowing the plaintiff's claim and on 10 May 2013, the Court of Appeal by way of a majority decision dismissed the defendant's appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Coming back to the sequence of events, the important point to note is that physical construction of the mall commenced in January 2006 and was completed in December 2006 at the costs of RM124 million. Despite ongoing litigation between the defendant and the plaintiff, the defendant carried on with the construction of the mall on the land since the defendant took the position that it was entitled to do so under the SPA and the PA. The SPA and PA were structured to facilitate the defendant to construct the mall upon the execution of the SPA as it was the target of the defendant to carry out business in January 2007 before the Chinese New Year.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> On 22 January 2007, a temporary CFO was issued in the defendant's name for the mall constructed on the land. The final CFO for the mall was issued on 20 November 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> After the completion of the construction of the mall, the PA was revoked by the plaintiff on 19 June 2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> On 30 June 2010, the plaintiff's solicitors forwarded the differential sum of RM5.15 million to the defendant's solicitors after the Federal Court set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and orders by the High Court in the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14.;;">O 14A application</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The defendant did not accept the refund. On 1 July 2010, Messrs Yeo, Tan, Hoon &amp; Tee (the "defendant's new solicitors") returned the cheque for the RM5.15 million to the plaintiff's solicitors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> On 16 July 2010, the defendant's new solicitors forwarded the balance sum of RM25 million to the plaintiff's solicitors. The plaintiff did not accept the payment and returned the cheque the same day.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> It was the defendant's contention that the plaintiff had never given any notice of termination of the SPA to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The plaintiff had accepted the differential sum for the land in the amount of RM5.15 million whilst the litigation was on-going.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> It is an undisputed fact that the plaintiff at no point in time ever took out proceedings for an injunction to stop the defendant from constructing the mall on the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Proceedings At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> After a full trial of eleven days, with six witnesses testifying for the plaintiff and two for the defendant, the High Court found for the plaintiff. The reliefs granted by the High Court may be summarised as follows:</p>

      <b>[48]</b> The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the orders of the trial judge as set out above. However, as indicated earlier, the majority clarified the order relating to the account of profits ordered by the High Court and ruled that the defendant was only to pay the profits derived from its use and occupation of the land, following the assessment by the Registrar of the High Court.</p>

      <b>[50]</b> The Court of Appeal also delivered a minority judgment. The minority of the Court of Appeal held that the handwritten note written on 21 November 2005 by the defendant's representative was not a confirmation of acceptance of vacant possession of the land pursuant to the SPA, but was instead a confirmation of the fact that the School administration had been relocated. Therefore, this could not be construed as confirmation of acceptance of vacant possession as envisaged by Special Condition 3 of the SPA. Further, it was held that the acceptance of RM5.15 million which was a differential sum by the plaintiff towards the purchase of the land after the alleged date of 21 May 2006, amounted to an act of waiver on the part of the plaintiff. By so doing, it had waived its rights to insist on the strict compliance of Special Condition 3 of the SPA. The minority of the Court of Appeal allowed the defendant's counterclaim and granted the following reliefs:</p>

      <b>The Questions Of Law On Appeal To The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> As mentioned earlier, on 20 February 2014, this court granted leave to the defendant to appeal against the majority decision of the Court of Appeal on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Questions 5, 6, 7 and 8 deal with the liability questions. Whilst the remaining questions 1-4 and 9-11 relate to relief questions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> We will deal first with the liability questions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Liability Questions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(a) Vacant Possession</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The liability questions are intertwined and focused for the most part on the key issue of whether the SPA was validly terminated by the plaintiff. Prior to entering into the SPA, the plaintiff and the defendant were aware that there were forty squatters and the school on the land. It is pertinent to note that the school occupied a mere 5% of the land. The plaintiff was to grant vacant possession of the land by removing the squatters and relocating the school, within the time period provided in the SPA. The defendant was then obliged to complete the SPA by paying the balance purchase price (90%). The time period to complete the SPA by the defendant was to be computed from the date on which the plaintiff delivered vacant possession of the land. Nothing turns on the removal of the squatters in this case considering that it is not disputed that the squatters were evicted from the land by 21 November 2005. The dispute centres on the date on which the school was relocated by the plaintiff (for vacant possession purposes), and the date on which the defendant ought to have paid the balance purchase price (90%) to complete the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The date of delivery of vacant possession of the land is therefore critical for the reason that in accordance with the terms of Special Condition 3, the balance purchase price of RM30.15 million becomes due four months (with two months automatic extension) from the date of vacant possession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> As we pointed out earlier, the plaintiff's position is that the school was relocated and vacant possession was delivered on 21 November 2005. Thus, the balance purchase price became payable on 21 March 2006 (or on the extended date of 21 May 2006) per the SPA; the defendant failed to pay the balance purchase price on 21 March 2006 or 21 May 2006. The SPA was thereafter terminated pursuant to cl 12 of the SPA. Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff delivered vacant possession under Special Condition 1 on 21 November 2005, and therefore the provisions of Special Condition 3 were triggered. Thus, the balance purchase price became payable on 21 March 2006 or on the extended date of 21 May 2006 (with interest).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> On this issue, the submissions of learned counsel for the defendant can be summarised as follows. An important part of Special Condition 1 of the SPA was that the plaintiff had to hand vacant possession to the defendant upon the relocation of the school that was then situated on the land. Upon being given vacant possession, the defendant was given a maximum of six months to settle the balance of the purchase price. The representative of both the defendant and the plaintiff met on 21 November 2005 to inspect the land and to certify whether the school had been relocated. The school had four gates which were locked and the keys to the gates were only handed to the defendant on 28 February 2006. When the representatives of the defendant and the plaintiff met on 21 November 2005 to inspect the land, the representative of the defendant was asked to sign a pre-typed letter stating that vacant possession of the land had been delivered to the defendant. The defendant's representative refused to sign the pre-typed letter as prepared by the plaintiff and instead wrote the following words in his handwriting in the said letter: "I have jointly inspected the school site with the Edwin Tan &amp; Tang and confirm that the school administration has been relocated". The handwritten note did not constitute a confirmation that vacant possession of the land had been delivered to the defendant within the meaning of Special Condition 3 of the SPA. Both the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal attached an erroneous importance to the inspection carried out on 21 November 2005 by the representatives of both the defendant and the plaintiff. The High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal drew an erroneous series of inferences that clouded the principal issue of vacant possession. To end his submissions, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the majority of the Court of Appeal and the High Court had erred in holding that vacant possession of the land concerned had been delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant in the manner required under the terms and conditions of the SPA on 21 November 2005 instead of on 28 February 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In deciding in favour of the plaintiff, the majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the findings of fact of the High Court, which relied on the oral and contemporaneous documentary evidence of the parties. The concurrent findings of facts were first, the delivery of vacant possession by the plaintiff was on 21 November 2005, and the completion date for the SPA was on 21 March 2006 or the extended completion date of 21 May 2006; and secondly, the defendant breached the SPA when it failed to pay the 90% balance of the purchase price on 21 March 2006 or 21 May 2006, and the SPA was automatically terminated by virtue of cl 12 the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> It is now established that the principle on which an appellate court could interfere with findings of fact by the trial court is "the plainly wrong test" principle; see the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_1;"><i>Gan Yook Chin &amp; Anor v. Lee Ing Chin &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 1; [2004] 4 CLJ 309; [2004] 6 AMR 781 (at p 10) per Steve Shim CJSS. More recently, this principle of appellate intervention was affirmed by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_2_668;"><i>UEM Group Bhd v. Genisys Integrated Engineers Pte Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 2 MLRA 668</LINK>; [2010] 9 CLJ 785 where it was held at p 675:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In our judgment, the concurrent findings were clearly justified and correct based on the oral and contemporaneous documentary evidence led before the High Court. There is irrefutable evidence that the school had, at the request of the plaintiff (and upon receiving compensation of RM1.5 million from the plaintiff), agreed to move out of the land by 18 November 2005. The evidence of the Headmaster of the School (PW6) and the evidence of the lorry driver (PW5) at who did the shifting showed that the school was in fact relocated on or before 19 November 2005. The plaintiff then confirmed that the land was ready for delivery of vacant possession on 16 November 2005 and proposed an inspection of the premises on 18 November 2005. However, the defendant proposed that a joint inspection to take place on 21 November 2005. The inspection was jointly carried out by the representative of both sides on 21 November 2005. Upon completion of the inspection the defendant's representative confirmed that he had "jointly inspected the school site with Mr Edwin Tan and Mr Tang and confirmed that 'the school administration has been relocated". It is to be noted that subsequent to the inspection, on 22 November 2005 the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the defendant's solicitors that there was a "... joint viewing of the site between your clients representative Mr Yiap Toon Cheng and our client's on 21 November 2005 ...'' and stated that the defendant's "...representative has confirmed that he is satisfied with the eviction of all the squatters and the relocation of the school". In reply, the defendant's solicitors accepted that the school had been relocated and agreed that the completion date would be 21 March 2006 (and the extended completion date would be 21 May 2006. Significantly, this contemporary letter clearly points to a very different picture from the defendant's current position. In relying, among others, on this letter to conclude that vacant possession was delivered on 21 November 2005, the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal had applied the correct approach in testing the veracity of oral evidence by reference to the contemporary documentary evidence. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_81;"><i>Tindok Besar Estate Sdn Bhd v. Tinjar Co</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 81</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 229, Chang Min Tat FJ explained the importance for trial judge to have regard to the contemporary documents:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In our view, there are at least three reasons why the contention of the defendant that vacant possession was only granted on 28 February 2006 are wholly untenable. In the first place, under special condition 1, if vacant possession had not taken place in November 2005, ie within 12 months, then the contract fell and there could be no later date to obtain vacant possession. Secondly, between 21 November 2005 (the joint inspection) and 7 March 2006, the defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff had delivered vacant possession. It is the ordinary nature of businessman to immediately refute any proposition injurious to him contained in letters and not to let it stands (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_708;"><i>David Wong Hon Leong v. Noorazman Adnan</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 708</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 283; [1995] 4 CLJ 155; [1996] 1 AMR 007). Thus, the previous conduct of the defendant in accepting that the delivery of vacant possession was on 21 November 2005 was plainly contrary to its new position that vacant possession was only granted on 28 February 2006. Thirdly, it was only on 8 March 2006, which was about fourteen days before the completion date (21 March 2006), that the defendant's solicitors for the first time alleged that vacant possession was only delivered on 28 February 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> This brings us to the issue of 'quiet possession' raised by the defendant. In its letter of 8 March 2006, the defendant's solicitors alleged that the defendant "... has not indeed enjoy quiet possession ..." and they repeated this in their letter of 22 March 2006 "... our client has never enjoyed quiet possession in actual fact ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> There is no provision under the said SPA concerning the "quiet possession'' of the land. As submitted by learned counsel for the plaintiff, there was nothing in the SPA that obliged the plaintiff to give a guarantee/warranty of "quiet possession" to the defendant. It is an established principle that a party to a contract cannot ex post facto seek to introduce a new term into the contract which is all together outside the contract (see the judgment of Privy Council in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_198;"><i>Phoenix Heights Estate Pte Ltd v. Lee Kay Guan &amp; Anor</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 198</LINK>; [1982] 2 MLJ 86 and also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_102;"><i>Mintye Properties Sdn Bhd v. Yayasan Melaka</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 102</LINK>; [2006] 6 MLJ 420; [2006] 4 CLJ 267; [2006] 6 AMR 7).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> In our view, the defendant has attempted to unilaterally introduce a new term (of quiet possession) in the SPA. Further, it is noteworthy that the defendant had never at any time between 21 November 2005 and February 2006 written to the plaintiff to complain about any "lack of quiet possession" of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Moreover, we agree with the submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff that as a matter of law, the defendant was obliged to show that the interference by the school, if any, was substantial, to succeed in its claim that the interference vitiated the delivery of vacant possession. This principle can be seen in <i>Cumberland Consolidated Holdings Limited v. Ireland</i> [1946] 1 KB 264 where the English Court of Appeal decided that any physical impediment to vacant possession must substantially prevent or interfere with the enjoyment of the right of possession to a substantial part of the property. The case of <i>Cumberland Consolidated Holdings Limited v. Ireland (supra)</i> has been more recently considered by the English Court of Appeal and approved in <i>Ibrend Estates BV v. NYK Logistics (UK) Ltd</i> [2011] 4 All ER 539.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> On the facts of the present case, there is no evidence that the plaintiff or the school authority had prevented the defendant from entering the land after the joint inspection of 21 November 2005. Moreover, there is also no evidence that there was any interference with the defendant's use and enjoyment of the land after 21 November 2005; and as at 21 November 2005, the defendant was already in occupation of 95% of the land. In truth, the defendant had free access in and out of the land and the school since 21 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> On the issue of vacant possession, we therefore conclude that vacant possession of the land was delivered by the plaintiff on 21 November 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(b) Automatic Termination</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Evidently, as set out earlier, the defendant only paid the 10% deposit of the purchase price and failed to pay the balance purchase price by the completion date of 21 March 2006. Thereafter, the plaintiff's solicitors issued the defendant a notice of extension of two months pursuant to Special Condition 3. The defendant did not challenge this notice. The defendant then breached the SPA by failing to pay the balance purchase price by the extended completion date of 21 May 2006. In this regard, it is trite that the obligation to pay the purchase price is a fundamental obligation of the SPA. The failure to pay the balance purchase price goes to the root of the SPA thereby rendering the SPA terminated (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_69;"><i>Ching Yik Development Sdn Bhd v. Setapak Heights Development Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 69</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 675; [1997] 1 CLJ 287; [1997] 1 AMR 89, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_276;"><i>Master Strike Sdn Bhd v. Sterling Heights Sdn Bhd</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 276</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 585; [2005] 2 CLJ 596; [2005] 3 AMR 378, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1988_1_156;"><i>Yee Chee Pang v.

The Titular Roman Catholic Bishop Of Malacca Johore</i> [2010] 2 MLRA 440</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 398; [2010] 8 CLJ 920).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> In the present case, the failure on the part of the defendant to pay the balance purchase price by the completion date brought into operation cl 12 of the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that this resulted in the automatic termination of the said SPA and accordingly, there was no requirement for a notice of termination to be issued by the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> Both the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal accepted that the SPA had been validly terminated in accordance to cl 12. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the findings of the High Court in that there was "automatic termination" of the SPA as provided for by cl 12 of the SPA as a fundamental breach of the contract had taken place. There was no obligation for the plaintiff to give the defendant any notice of termination as the plaintiff had alerted the defendant's solicitors of the consequence of not paying the balance of the purchase price by 21 May 2006. On this point, the majority of the Court of Appeal decided as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to adequately evaluate and appreciate the correct principles of law that in the event of a breach by a party to a contract, the aggrieved party had to elect whether to continue with or to terminate the contract, and must communicate of such election to the other party. Learned counsel submitted that the critical conduct of the plaintiff which the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal seemed to have paid inadequate attention to was that although claiming that the agreement was terminated, the plaintiff did absolutely nothing save for issuing one letter to the defendant stating that the plaintiff should stop construction on the land, which the defendant did not do as there was no notice of termination of the SPA, and the fact that the PA was never terminated, which allowed the defendant to deal with the land. It was his contention that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the SPA was "automatically" terminated on 21 May 2006 by operation of cl 12 of the said SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> To support his contention, learned counsel for the defendant brought to our attention the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_6_622;"><i>P Palakrishnan Perianan v. Krishnamoorthy Sinniah &amp; Anor</i> [2001] 6 MLRH 622</LINK> where it was held that there was no concept of automatic termination of contract under contract law; therefore, a party who wished to terminate the contract on presumption that the other party had breached the terms must state the intention to do so in writing or orally.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> It is very important now to take a closer look at cl 12 of the SPA:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> In our view, whether or not a clause in an agreement has the effect of providing for automatic termination and confers on a party a right to immediate termination, must be considered by the words used by the parties in the particular agreement and this will depend very much on the circumstances of each individual case. In the present case, however, what stands out is that on a matter of substance, cl 12 expressly provides that "the contract shall be treated as null and void and of no further effect". The contractual language is clear and plain enough. That explicit and unambiguous words must be given its literal meaning. The immediate consequence of the termination compellingly favours the view that automatic termination was intended by the plaintiff and the defendant when they mutually agreed to be bound by the SPA. In our view, cl 12, as a contractual term explicitly agreed between the plaintiff and the defendant, provides for the automatic termination of the SPA upon the defendant's failure to pay the balance purchase price within the stipulated time period. In such a situation, there was no requirement for a notice of termination to be issued by the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> The concept of the automatic termination of a contract, pursuant to the terms of the contract, is not novel or unusual in Malaysian contract law as can be seen in the following cases cited by learned counsel for the plaintiff: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_6_511;"><i>Sangkala Sdn Bhd v. Bennlim Engineering Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1998] 6 MLRH 511</LINK>, where the High Court upheld the automatic termination clause of a sale and purchase agreement on the grounds that the balance purchase price had not been paid within the stipulated time frame; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_7_53;"><i>Tan Beng @ Tan York Soon v. Ji Kang Dimensi Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2001] 7 MLRH 53</LINK>, where the High Court held that the automatic termination clause of a sale and purchase agreement had been validly invoked; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_4_490;"><i>SCK Group Berhad v. Poh Chen Guang &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 4 MLRH 490</LINK>, where the High Court again upheld the automatic termination clause in a contract in the context of an application for summary judgment; and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2013_4_214;"><i>Norani Maniran &amp; Satu Lagi lwn. Mayban General Assurance Berhad</i> [2013] 4 MLRH 214</LINK>; [2012] 9 MLJ 610; [2013] 2 CLJ 1126, where the automatic termination clause under the contract was upheld by the High Court. We were also referred to a decision of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_80;"><i>Kredin Sdn Bhd v. YTF Investments Sdn Bhd</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 80</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 46; [1998] 1 CLJ 205; [1997] 4 AMR 4069. In that case YTF Investments Sdn Bhd ("YTF") and Kredin Sdn Bhd ("Kredin") entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 29 October 1992 whereby the Kredin agreed to purchase three pieces of land for RM47.5 million. Kredin obtained a loan for RM15.7 million from a bank. A deposit of RM5 million had been paid by Kredin. According to the agreement, the balance of the purchase price of RM42.5 million was to be paid on or before the completion date which was 30 June 1983 and time was of the essence. It was also provided that in the event of Kredin failing to pay the balance of the purchase price by the completion date, the deposit of RM5 million would be forfeited to YTF as agreed liquidated damages and thereupon the agreement would become null and void, and YTF would be entitled to deal with the property as it deemed fit. Kredin had in fact failed to pay the balance of the purchase price by the completion date and this was not disputed. YTF therefore terminated the agreement and accordingly forfeited the deposit of RM5 million. Kredin, among others, contended that the agreement was not properly terminated as notice of termination was required to be given to the bank and this YTF had failed to do. The Court of Appeal held that the agreement was properly terminated on 1 July 1983 as Kredin had failed to meet its obligation to settle the balance of the purchase price by the completion date. The agreement therefore became null and void, pursuant to a clause in it. The court upheld the validity of the automatic termination of the sale and purchase agreement in view of the contract breaker's failure to pay the balance purchase price by the completion date. In the words of the Court of Appeal:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> In our judgment, the above passage and the passage from the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the instant case which we have referred to earlier in para 72, state correctly the law on automatic termination. We therefore agree with the submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff that the case of <i>P Palakrishnan Perianan v. Krishnamoorthy Sinniah &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, was decided <i>per incuriam</i> as it did not consider the Court of Appeal case of <i>Kredin Sdn Bhd v. YTF Investments Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> which upheld the enforceability of the automatic termination clause in the context of a sale and purchase agreement. In our view, there can be no question as to the enforceability of the automatic termination clause in the SPA in the instant case under Malaysian contract law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> It is noteworthy that, as submitted by learned counsel for the plaintiff, the automatic termination of a contract is a concept that is recognised across the Commonwealth as can be seen in the Privy Council case of <i>New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v. Societe des Ateliers et Chantiers de France</i> [1919] AC l, <i>Westralian Farmaers Ltd v. Commonwealth Agricultural Service Engineers Ltd</i> [1936] 54 CLR 361 (High Court of Australia), <i>Moreton v. Montrose Ltd</i> [1986] 2 NZLR 496 (Court of Appeal of New Zealand) and <i>Waterman v. Gerling Australia Insurance Co PTY Ltd</i> [2005] NSWSC 1066 (Supreme Court of New South Wales).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> This leads us to the contention of learned counsel for the defendant that cl 12 is void pursuant to the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;40.;;">s 40 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> which stipulates that when a party to a contract has refused to perform, or disabled himself from performing, his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end to the contract, unless he has signified, by words or conduct, his acquiescence in its continuance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> The point put forward by learned counsel for the defendant raised the important question whether parties may contract out of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;;">Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. This was the principle issue for decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_654;"><i>Ooi Boon Leong &amp; Ors v. Citibank Na</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 654</LINK>; [1984] 1 MLJ 222. On this point, the Privy Council explained the 'freedom to contract' principle in the following terms (with the necessary emphasis):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> By parity of reasoning, in our judgment, in view of the clear wording of cl 12, the parties to the SPA had agreed to waive the requirement for the issuance of a notice of termination upon the breach of the SPA. This is because, as we have explained earlier, cl 12 expressly provides that the SPA "shall be treated as null and void and of no further effect upon the non-payment of the balance purchase price within the stipulated time period". In the result, the enforceability of cl 12 is not open to challenge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In any event, as submitted by learned counsel for the plaintiff, vide letter dated 9 March 2006 the plaintiff had informed the defendant advanced notice of consequential termination. The material part of the 9 March 2006 letter reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> It is for the court to infer from the surrounding circumstances whether, pursuant to s 40 of the Contracts Act 1950, the plaintiff had elected to affirm in the continuance of the SPA or to treat it as at an end (see the objective test propounded in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_102;"><i>Mintye Properties Sdn Bhd v. Yayasan Melaka</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 102</LINK>; [2006] 6 MLJ 420; [2006] 4 CLJ 267; [2006] 6 AMR 7). In our view, the letter dated 9 March 2006 and the plaintiff's conduct on 28 August 2006 in filing the writ of summons herein, which initiated the present suit against the defendant provide compelling evidence of the plaintiff having treated the SPA as terminated to the knowledge of the defendant after the extended completion date of 21 May 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(c) Part Payment/Interim Payment Of The Purchase Price</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> From the background facts that we have narrated earlier, it was in evidence that the plaintiff accepted a sum of RM5.15 million, being the differential sum from the defendant, three months after the expiry of the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> The contention of learned counsel for the defendant was that the act of receiving the sum of RM5.15 million after the alleged extended completion date amounted to an act of waiver of any alleged breach of the SPA. Learned counsel submitted that it was a clear indication that time was not of the essence in so far as making payment of the balance of the purchase price was concerned. This act, it was contended, also would have revived the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> On this issue, the High Court made a finding of fact that the plaintiff did not accept part payment and/or interim payment of the purchase price. This is what the High Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> The High Court also dealt with the issue of waiver in this manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> In our judgment, on consideration of the evidence and the material available in the Records of Appeal, it was entirely reasonable for the High Court to arrive at the above conclusion. There was more than sufficient admissible evidence to support the High Court's findings. It is trite that an appellate court would be slow to disturb a trial court's findings of facts in the absence of any perverse and unwarranted finding on the totality of the evidence before it. The cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_144;"><i>Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat &amp; Anor v. Plenitude Holdings Sdn Bhd</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 144</LINK>; [1993] 1 MLJ 113; [1993] 2 CLJ 146; [1995] 1 AMR 041, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_665;"><i>Eastern &amp; Oriental Hotel (1951) Sdn Bhd v. Ellarious George Fernandez &amp; Anor</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 665</LINK>; [1989] 1 MLJ 35 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_150;"><i>Lim Kim Chet &amp; Anor v. Multar Masngud</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 150</LINK>; [1984] 2 MLJ 165; [1984] 1 CLJ 23 are some of the authorities to support the cardinal principle that an appellate court should be slow in interfering with a finding of fact of the trial court which had observed the demeanour and heard the witnesses before coming to its conclusion. In the present appeal, it has not been successfully shown to us that the findings of the High Court is against the weight of evidence or perverse in any way. The judgment of the High Court does not contain any serious error warranting appellate interference.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> The findings confirm that the RM5.15 million was not part/interim payment of the contractual sum and the payment in question was made on 22 August 2006, long after the expiry of the completion dates and the termination of the contract. As found by the High Court, the defendant knew at all material times that the RM5.15 million was being retained by the plaintiff as security for damages pending a court order which was obtained on 10 October 2006 and upon the order being set aside the plaintiff sought to return but the defendant refused to accept it. In this way, no waiver was possible. It is, therefore, indefensible for the defendant to contend that the plaintiff accepted the RM5.15 million. Indeed, the defendant cannot take advantage of its own refusal to take back the sum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> Furthermore, we entirely agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the plaintiff that once the contract was terminated then it was at an end save for the innocent party seeking the appropriate remedies for breach of contract. In truth, it is impossible for a contract that had been terminated to remain in some "frozen" state waiting for some other event to happen that might be found to have kept it alive. Neither was there any legal basis for the alleged "revival" or "keeping alive" of the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Answers To The Liability Questions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> In consequence, our answers to the liability questions are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> So far we have dealt with the issues pertaining to the liability questions. We conclude that the defendant only paid 10% deposit of the purchase price and failed to pay the balance of the purchase price even though obliged to do so under the SPA. As correctly decided by the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff had, in our judgment, validly terminated the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> This brings us to the relief questions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Relief Questions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(a) Unjust Enrichment And Restitution</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> To a large extent, this issue deals with the restitution that the defendant claims it is entitled to, over and above the costs of construction of the mall, under the law of unjust enrichment. In essence, the defendant claimed that it should also be awarded for the improvement and enhancement it made to the land. In its amended defence and counterclaim, the defendant among others pleaded that by building the mall at the costs of RM124 million it had greatly enhanced the value of the land; in no event should the plaintiff be allowed to reap a windfall at the expense of the defendant and that the plaintiff was not entitled to be unjustly enriched. In consequence, it was further pleaded, the land with the completed mall should be independently valued, and full credit be given to the defendant on the ground that it would constitute an unjust enrichment for the plaintiff to receive the mall without paying any adequate consideration for it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> In addressing this crucial issue, the following points have already been made earlier but deserved to be reiterated. The SPA was somewhat unconventional in that it specifically allowed the defendant immediate access to the land and the right to carry out construction of a commercial development on the land upon execution of the SPA and well before the completion of the SPA. In addition, a PA was also granted to the defendant which allowed the defendant to perform all acts and deeds in relation to the land as a registered owner could. The plaintiff was aware that the defendant wanted to buy the land for the purpose of constructing and completing the mall and be ready for business before Chinese New Year of 2007. The defendant's rights to commence, continue and complete construction of the mall on the land was separate from and independent of the delivery of vacant possession of the land. Even with the on-going litigation between the defendant and the plaintiff, the defendant carried on with the construction of the mall on the land as the defendant took the position that it was entitled to do so under the SPA and the PA. The plaintiff did not seek any interim injunctive relief to restrain the defendant from carrying substantial construction works prior to and/or after the completion date of the SPA of 21 March 2006. By the time the High Court delivered its decision on 11 November 2011, the mall had been fully operational for more or less a period of five years since its completion in early January 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> It is against the above background, learned counsel for the defendant contended that the majority of the Court of Appeal in making an order for the return of the land and the mall (together with the business now ongoing therein) and to only compensate the defendant for the construction costs of the mall would enrich the defendant to a tune of at least RM263 million. The submission of learned counsel was that this draconian award and benefit to the plaintiff amounts to 'punitive damages' at its highest level. He added that the plaintiff should not be allowed to reap a windfall at the expense of the defendant and that the plaintiff was not entitled to be unjustly enriched. The main thrust of learned counsel's contention was that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in failing to decide the appeal in a just and equitable manner and instead created a manifestly unfair result by virtue of a failure to fully judicially appreciate that what was required to be returned to the plaintiff was not the land that the plaintiff had sold to the defendant, but a physical building of a mall constructed by the defendant (with its own costs of RM124 million), and a vastly enhanced asset in the form of the business of a shopping mall, which enhancement was done through the sole effort and at the sole costs of the defendant. He also put forward a submission that the majority of the Court of Appeal in holding the defendant to be a contract breaker paid inadequate attention to the unconscionable conduct of the plaintiff. He drew particular attention to the fact that neither the High Court nor the majority of the Court of Appeal considered the fact that the plaintiff at no time took any steps to revoke the SPA or revoke the PA given to the defendant. And he also drew our attention to the fact that the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal also did not take into consideration that the plaintiff did not obtain an injunction to stop the defendant from constructing the mall after the alleged breach of contract at the relevant period in question. Learned counsel concluded his submission by contending that the proper relief to be granted would be the market value of the mall excluding any appreciation in land value not attributable to the mall expressed in the following equation: Current Market Value of the Land With the mall - Current Market Value of the Land Without the mall = Compensation to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> The pivotal position that the defendant sought to advance in this appeal was that the remedy that should be awarded to the defendant would be the full market value of the mall and not just the costs of construction of the mall.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> On the other hand, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the question revolving around the law of unjust enrichment was linked to the fact that the defendant was the contract-breaker and at all times the defendant should not profit from its breach. This was specifically what the defendant sought to do by asking that it be compensated for the current enhanced value of the land. By that it was indirectly seeking a sum higher than the balance of the purchase price it owed and the value of the land at the time the SPA was executed. Thus at the end of the day, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted, the entry into the contract and the breach of the contract by the defendant became a profitable commercial outing for the defendant. This, to quote learned counsel for the plaintiff 'is quite intolerable in equity'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[100]</b> To support his contention that the then Supreme Court had also previously dealt with the doctrine of unjust enrichment, learned counsel brought to our attention the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_520;"><i>New Kok Ann Realty Sdn Bhd v. Development &amp; Commercial Bank Ltd New Hebrides (In Liquidation)</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 520</LINK>; [1987] 2 MLJ 57. There, the respondents brought an action to claim from the appellants repayment of loans of US$25,000.00 and US$100,000.00. It was alleged that the sums were paid to the appellants by bank drafts. The appellants denied requesting the respondents for the sums by way of loan or that they had agreed or promised to repay them. They further said that if the said sums were remitted by the respondents to the appellants they were not for the benefit of the appellants but for the use or benefit of Mosbert Finance (Hong Kong) Ltd or other persons or companies. The learned judge gave judgment in favour of the respondents under the heading of loans and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;71.;;">s 71 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. The appellants appealed. In dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court held that the trial judge had rightly given judgment under the headings of loan and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;71.;;">s 71 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> and had considered that all the four conditions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;71.;;">s 71 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>, had been satisfied and the respondents had therefore established their claim under the said section.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[101]</b> We have read with care the judgment of <i>New Kok Ann Realty Sdn Bhd v. Development &amp; Commercial Bank Ltd New Hebrides (In Liquidation) (supra)</i>. With respect we note that the Supreme Court made no reference to the law of unjust enrichment. A closer reading of the judgment will show the Supreme Court in that case decided the appeal entirely on the basis of the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;71.;;">s 71 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> and not based on the law of unjust enrichment as we understand it today.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[102]</b> Learned counsel then argued that the issue relating to the law of unjust enrichment was to be determined by looking, among others, at the following conduct and motives of the defendant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[103]</b> It has to be emphasised that the fundamental position taken by the plaintiff was that at the relevant time the defendant was a trespasser and if the defendant was entitled to any award for improving the land it could only be for the costs of the construction of the mall. In the result, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the defendant should not be entitled to anything more than the costs of construction of the mall as ordered by the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal. Learned counsel relied on the case of <i>Blue Haven v. Tully and Robinson</i> [2006] UKPC 17 and <i>JS Bloor v. Pavillion</i> [2008] EWHC 724 to support the following propositions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[104]</b> As we shall see later in this judgment, based on the law of unjust enrichment as we apply today, the above contentions of learned counsel for the plaintiff are not free from difficulties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[105]</b> The majority of the Court of Appeal expressed their conclusion that the award should be limited to the costs of construction of the mall in the following passage:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[106]</b> The passage above raises some vexed issues. On this, we have two observations. The first is that that the majority of the Court of Appeal used the term 'compensation' in relation to the relief granted to the defendant. With respect, that term is inaccurate in the context of the right to restitution based on the law of unjust enrichment. As stated by <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law Of Unjust Enrichment</i>, 8th edn, (para 4-01), 'the law of unjust enrichment is concerned with transfers of value between claimants and defendants, and a claim in unjust enrichment is "not a claim for compensation for loss, but for recovery of a benefit unjustly gained by a defendant at the expense of the claimant". In this way, the usage of the term 'restitution' should be contrasted with the term 'compensation'. The second observation is that it appears the majority of the Court of Appeal was persuaded by the dicta in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_3_1;"><i>Berjaya Times Square Sdn Bhd v. M-Concept Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 3 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 1 MLJ 597; [2010] 1 CLJ 269 to the effect that a contract breaker should not benefit for his wrong. However the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to take into consideration that in that case the court also observed that first, a court interpreting a private contract was not confined to the four corners of the document. It was entitled to look at the factual matrix forming the background to the transaction. Secondly, the factual matrix which formed the background to the transaction included all material that was reasonably available to the parties. Thirdly, the interpreting court must disregard any part of the background that was declaratory of subjective intent only. Lastly, the court should adopt an objective approach when interpreting a private contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[107]</b> We pause here for a moment to underline the significance of the law of unjust enrichment in relation to all the rights of the parties to a contract which has been validly terminated. The critical issue that needs to be addressed is what constitutes unjust enrichment and undue benefit, and in what manner should a purchaser of vacant land be granted restitutionary relief when he has constructed a building on the said piece of land pursuant to and expressly permitted by a contract between him and the vendor. In our view, the following issues are important to determine the outcome of this appeal. Is it fair and equitable for the purchaser upon the termination of contract to be awarded only the cost of construction of the building, in this case the mall, or the market value of the mall?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[108]</b> This is a good place to point out that remedies for contractual disputes are generally compensatory in nature, with damages assessed based on the loss suffered by the claimant. Restitutionary remedies, on the other hand, focus on any unjust enrichment to a party at the claimant's expense. It is aimed of restoring that enrichment to the claimant. It is clear on principle and on authority that the idea of justice behind this aim is that no one should be made richer through loss to another.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[109]</b> In <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law of Unjust Enrichment (supra)</i>, para 1-08, it is stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[110]</b> Restitution simply means that a party who has received a benefit must restore the benefit received by him. The theoretical foundation of the right to restitution remedy as it is understood today is that it is founded on the law of unjust enrichment which fall outside the domains of contract and tort. The law of contract/tort and the law of unjust enrichment are conceptually distinct. Unjust enrichment describes a cause of action. On the other hand restitution describes a remedy. Restitution as a response to wrongdoing is therefore a different topic from restitution as a response to unjust enrichment (see: <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law of Unjust Enrichment (supra)</i> para 1-04). The courts have found it necessary to make available, independent of the law of contract and civil wrongs, for the restoration of benefits on the grounds of unjust enrichment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[111]</b> As stated by Lord Wright in <i>Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour, Limited</i> [1943] AC 32 at p 61:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[112]</b> Since then English law has recognised an independent law of unjust enrichment by recognising a claim for restitution based on unjust enrichment. According to <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law of Unjust Enrichment (supra)</i> (see para 1-05), the highest courts have now conclusively recognised that unjust enrichment is a distinct source of rights and obligations in English private law that ranks alongside contract and civil wrongs in importance and accordingly calls for discrete stand-alone treatment. This was shown in a number of cases which were cited by learned counsel for the defendant, namely <i>Banque Financiere de la Cité v. Parc (Battersea) Ltd</i> [1999] 1 AC 221, <i>The Queen on the application of Charles Rowe v. Vale of White Horse DC</i> [2003] EWHC 388 (Admin), <i>Cressman v. Coys of Kensington (Sales) Ltd</i> [2004] EWCA Civ 47, [2004] 1 WLR 2775, <i>Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police v. Wigan Athletic AFC Ltd</i> [2008] EWCA Civ 1449, <i>Sempra Metals Ltd (formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd) v. Inland Revenue Commissioners and Another</i> [2008] 1 AC 561 and <i>Investment Trust Companies v. HMRC</i> [2012] EWHC 458 (Ch).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[113]</b> We need not go through all the cases here. We would only draw attention to two decisions of the House of Lords. First, the important case of <i>Banque Financiere de la Cité v. Parc (Battersea) Ltd (supra)</i>. We think it is helpful if we give an account of the background facts of this case. In 1988 Parc obtained a bank loan from Royal Trust Bank (Switzerland) ("RTB.") in order to purchase a development property. The loan was secured by a debenture containing a first legal charge over the property. Omincorp Overseas Limited (OOL) had a second legal charge over the property as security for another debt. Both Parc and OOL were companies within the same group. In 1990, Herzig, the general manager of the group's holding company, negotiated a refinancing loan with Banque Financiere de la Cite (BFC), for the purpose of enabling Parc to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan from RTB. In order to avoid BFC's obligations under Swiss federal banking regulations, the transaction was restructured by interposing Herziq as the immediate borrower, and he then paid the money to Parc, who used it to pay part of RTB's loan. Parc provided no security for the BFC's loan, but BFC obtained an assignment from Herziq of a promissory note for the relevant sum given to him by Parc, and a "postponement letter," signed by Herziq, stating that all companies in the group would not demand any repayment of loans made to Parz until BFC's loan to Herziq had been repaid in full. Both Parc and OOL were unaware of the existence of the letter. The group of companies collapsed in 1991, and Parz became insolvent. BFC obtained judgment against the Parz for the sum due on the promissory note plus interest. OOL also obtained judgment against Parc and contended that their debt took priority by reason of the second charge. BFC relied on the postponement letter to claim priority over OOL. The trial judge ruled that, although the letter was not binding on Parc and OOL because they did not know of it, they nevertheless knew enough to permit a presumption of the mutual intention which was necessary to activate the remedy of subrogation so as to prevent OOL from being unjustly enriched at the BFC's expense. The Court of Appeal reversed that decision on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that subrogation would give the BFC's rights for which they had never bargained, namely the rights of a first mortgagee, and would place them in a more favourable position than if the letter had been binding. In allowing BFC's appeal and restoring the order of the trial judge, the House of Lords held that availability of subrogation as a restitutionary remedy, unlike contractual subrogation, did not depend on the intention of the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[114]</b> In the context of our present case, the key part of the judgment is the speech of Lord Steyn as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[115]</b> To similar effect is the speech of Lord Clyde:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[116]</b> The second House of Lords case is equally important. It is the case of <i>Sempra Metals Ltd (formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd) v. Inland Revenue Commissioners and Another</i> [2008] 1 AC 561. For our present purpose, it is not necessary to narrate the facts of the case. What is of importance is the elucidation by Lord Hope on the basis of the restitutionary award in the following passage:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[117]</b> The above passages from the judgments of the House of Lords are instructive and are significant contribution to the development of law of unjust enrichment. The principle underlying the cases of <i>Banque Financiere de la Cité v. Parc (Battersea) Ltd (supra)</i> and <i>Sempra Metals Ltd (formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd) v. Inland Revenue Commissioners and Another (supra)</i> is that, in the context of the present case, a cause of action in unjust enrichment can give rise to a right to restitution where it can be established that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[118]</b> Nearer home, there is now no longer any question that unjust enrichment law is a new developing area of law which is recognised by our courts. That the principle of unjust enrichment is the basis to justify an award of restitutionary relief can be seen in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_3_886;"><i>Sediperak Sdn Bhd v. Baboo Chowdhury</i> [1998] 3 MLRH 886</LINK> and in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_605;"><i>Air Express International (M) Sdn Bhd v. MISC Agencies Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 605</LINK>; [2012] 4 CLJ 589. Nevertheless, it has to be said that despite the increase in judicial reference to the expression of unjust enrichment to justify an award of restitutionary reliefs, the law of unjust enrichment is still in its formative stage in our jurisdiction (see article entitled '<i>An Introduction to the Law of Unjust Enrichment</i>' [2013] 5 MLJ 1 by Alvin W-L See). In our view, the time has come for this court to recognise the law of unjust enrichment by which justice is done in a range factual circumstances, and that the restitutionary remedy is at all times so applied to attain justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[119]</b> Applying those principles, we now turn to consider whether the defendant has made out a cause of action in unjust enrichment: the plaintiff has been enriched, that this enrichment was gained at the defendant's expense, that the plaintiff's enrichment at the defendant's expense was unjust, and whether there are any special defences to the claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[120]</b> We will consider each of the requirements in turn. But first it must be noted that no special defence was relied on by the plaintiff; in that sense the fourth requirement was not in dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Was The Plaintiff Enriched?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[121]</b> Benefits are only capable of generating claims in unjust enrichment if they have monetary value (see <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law of Unjust Enrichment (supra)</i> para 4-03). In this regard, it is important to point out that what is required to be returned to the plaintiff is not the land that the plaintiff had sold to the defendant, but an enormously enhanced and improved asset in the form of the business of a mall, which unquestionably have a monetary value. One important fact requires to be kept in mind. The mall, has been a thriving mall with an occupancy rate of more than 80% tenanted with over 250 retail outlets, operating for the past seven years since its completion in December 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[122]</b> It cannot be disputed that the market value of the mall far exceeds that of the value of the land. As submitted by learned counsel for the defendant, if the mall were to be sold to a third party, the unjust enrichment and undue benefit accrued to the plaintiff would be enormous. At its very worst, the land if left empty or vacant would not have appreciated considerably. This in itself would enrich the plaintiff with a windfall of a fully occupied and vibrant mall with tenants on the land resulting in undue enrichment far in excess of the contractual price of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[123]</b> The plaintiff has unquestionably benefited even though it did not request for the mall to be constructed. But the mall was not constructed and maintained by the defendant to benefit the plaintiff gratuitously. The plaintiff does not seek the aid of the court to pull down the mall. The plaintiff undoubtedly is now in a position to have the benefit of a completely constructed mall. The construction of the mall is indeed an objective enrichment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff would receive a massively enhanced asset and this adds to its enrichment. The mall is an indisputable benefit to the plaintiff. Therefore, we conclude that the first requirement is satisfied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Was The Enrichment At The Expense Of The Defendant?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[124]</b> The defendant did not only construct a building, or merely constructed a property on land. The defendant had built and continues to build an entire enterprise, brand name, goodwill encompassing all that is known as the mall. But more than that, the defendant's <i>bona fide</i> improvement and enhancement of the land, namely by obtaining permission, building plan approval and constructing the mall were all done entirely through the sole act and effort and at the sole costs of the defendant. By reason of the defendant constructing the mall at its own costs on the land, it had substantially enhanced in value.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[125]</b> In this regard, we have given our utmost consideration of the two cases relied on by learned counsel for the plaintiff, namely <i>Blue Haven v. Tully and Robinson (supra)</i> and <i>JS Bloor v. Pavillion (supra)</i> to point the difference of that cases from the case before us. In the present case the majority decision of the Court of Appeal made a finding that the construction in itself was lawful and that the defendant had a legal right to continue the construction of the mall pending the final determination of the Suit herein in the High Court as the PA was not terminated. Moreover, apart from issuing a single letter dated 18 October 2006 to ask that the defendant cease all construction work on the land, the plaintiff took no other action to stop the defendant from constructing on the land. The plaintiff at no time took any steps to revoke the PA given to the defendant. The plaintiff did not obtain an injunction to stop the defendant from constructing the mall after the alleged breach of contract at the relevant period in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[126]</b> The defendant had embarked upon the promotion of the mall and was responsible for the overall running, upkeep and maintenance of the building, road and infrastructure as well as the general administration of the mall. The defendant had expended time, effort, expertise and all at its own costs in establishing and maintaining the business venture known as the mall to the stature and success it had reached to date. This involved extensive and continuous marketing and promotional strategies since the inception of the mall.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[127]</b> In our judgment, the enrichment or benefit of the plaintiff was undoubtedly at the expense of the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Was The Enrichment Unjust?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[128]</b> The most important question which we must now asked is whether it is unjust for the plaintiff to retain to the benefit (the unjust question). The English approach to the unjust question is to ascertain an unjust factor such as, for example, mistake or failure of consideration. This differs with the civilian approach to the unjust question which consider whether there is a lack of juristic basis. <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law of Unjust Enrichment (supra)</i>, para 1-11, explained these two approaches as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[129]</b> We would adopt "the absence of basis" (to borrow the term used by <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law of Unjust Enrichment (supra)</i> para 1-19) approach of the civilian and mixed law systems for the reason that, in our view, it would produce a fairer outcome. Applying this approach, the plaintiff can escape restitutionary liability by showing that there was a legal ground for receiving an enormously enhanced and improved asset in the form of the business of a shopping mall. The important point to note here is that the defendant was not required to benefit the plaintiff by legislations or by contract. In our judgment the reason why there is liability in these circumstances is that the plaintiff's enrichment is unjustified and that there is no legal ground for the plaintiff to claim and enjoy the full commercial value of the mall. Therefore, the defendant has a <i>prima facie</i> right to restitution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[130]</b> On the factual matrix of the present case, in our judgment, injustice has occurred to such an extent that the defendant has not only suffered a loss, but the plaintiff is at the same time made richer by the defendant's loss by the same amount. On that note, the point to make here is this. This sense of injustice at the defendant's expense is central to the foundation of the relief of restitution based on the law of unjust enrichment. The plaintiff should not be allowed to reap the windfall at the expense of the defendant. The defendant lawfully constructed the mall on the land not intending to do so gratuitously with the plaintiff enjoying its benefit. On this basis, it warrants judicial intervention as a legal response triggered by an unjust enrichment in the fact situation of the present case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[131]</b> To conclude, we hold that the defendant had made out a cause of action in unjust enrichment in that the plaintiff has been enriched, that this enrichment was gained at the defendant's expense, and that the plaintiff's enrichment was unjust.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[132]</b> The following critical question then arises: what proper remedy should be awarded to the defendant? On the remedy issue, it is instructive to refer again to <i>Goff &amp; Jones on The Law of Unjust Enrichment (supra)</i> para 36-02, where it is stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[133]</b> In this regard, learned counsel for the defendant referred to a line of Australian authorities which support the proposition that the proper award to the defendant in the present case is the extent which the value of the land has been enhanced. In <i>Lexane Pty Ltd v. Highfern Pty Ltd</i> [1985] 1 QdR 446, the plaintiff was the purchaser of a building for $11,500,000. It duly paid a total $4,500,000. Upon the extended date for completion, the plaintiff defaulted in payment of the balance purchase moneys and other moneys due under the contract as varied. On that date the defendant vendor served on the plaintiff a notice in purported compliance with s 72 of the Property Law Act. It referred to the plaintiff's default in payment of $7,000,000 balance purchase price and of a further $1,784,001.40 due under provisions of the contract and a deed of variation. It then added "you defaulted in payment of any other monies payable pursuant to" the contract and the deed. It then gave notice that, unless within thirty days of service of the notice "you pay or tender to (the vendor) the sum of $8,784,001.40, being the amount of the said instalment and other monies payable as aforesaid, together with any other monies payable pursuant to" the contract and deed, the contract as varied by the deed would be determined without further notice. There were no other monies than the sum of $8,784.001.40 payable. The court declared the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was validly rescinded. McPherson J stated the following in regard to the principles relating to the adjustment of the rights between the parties upon discharge of a contract for the sale in relation to improvements:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[134]</b> The approach in <i>Lexane Pty Ltd v. Highfern Pty Ltd (supra)</i> in awarding the value of the enhancements made to the land was affirmed as correct in <i>Stern v. MacArthur</i> [1988] 165 CLR 489. These cases are relevant and persuasive in deciding the proper remedy to be awarded to the defendant in the present case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[135]</b> Having regard to the factual matrix and the prevailing circumstances, in our view the High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to judicially appreciate that the amount of unjust enrichment gained by the plaintiff is the ultimate value of the land as a result of the defendant's improvement and enhancement. The High Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal were wrong in failing to properly and judicially appreciate that the amount of unjust enrichment was not the mere costs of constructing the mall but that the amount of the unjust enrichment was for all intents and purposes the value of the enhancement or enrichment as a whole encompassing of improvement and enhancement of the land, namely by obtaining planning permission, building plan approval, design and conceptual development, business modelling and constructing at the defendant's own costs, effort and experience, upon the land a shopping mall which subsequently was tenanted with an ongoing business, goodwill and brand name.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[136]</b> By reason thereof, it will remain manifestly unfair and unjust for the plaintiff to be enriched to the extent of the full commercial value of the mall, while having only to pay for the costs of its physical construction to the defendant. On authority as well as on principle, in our judgment, the defendant is, on those facts, entitled to a monetary award in the sum equivalent to the current market value of the mall excluding the market value of the land without the mall. As can be seen, the consequence of our order is that after paying the said monetary sum to the defendant, the plaintiff would from then on enjoy the full benefit of a completely constructed mall on the land, which we were informed in the course of the submissions before us, has a freehold title. This would unquestionably place the plaintiff in a far better position than it would have been had the plaintiff not entered into the SPA with the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>(b) Liability To Account For Profits</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[137]</b> The plaintiff took the position that the defendant as a contract breaker has to give an account of the profits that it has made as a result of being on the land and in control of the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[138]</b> On the other hand, the stand of the defendant was that for its occupation on the land, the appropriate measure of relief is for market rent for the use of the unimproved land and nothing more.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[139]</b> As stated earlier, the majority of the Court of Appeal clarified the order relating to the accounts of profits ordered by the High Court and held that the defendant is only to pay the profits derived from its use and occupation of the land, in accordance to the principles in <i>Attorney General v. Blake (Jonathan Cap Ltd Third Party)</i> [2001] 1 AC 268. As in the High Court and the Court of Appeal, before us, learned counsel for the plaintiff placed heavy reliance on that case and further submitted that this was a case that fell within the category of "exceptional cases of breach of contract" that Lord Nichols spoke of in <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i> where an account of profits could be ordered. Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that a determination of this issue must be grounded on a consideration of the improper conduct of the defendant in constructing the mall and, further, in improperly creating third party rights on the land after the SPA was terminated. It is his submission that an innocent party in a sale and purchase agreement was entitled to accounts for profits obtained by the defaulting party who was in breach of the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[140]</b> Since heavy reliance is placed by the plaintiff on <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i>, it is very important to appreciate the facts of the case in order to understand the significance of the context in which the order to account for profits were made by the House of Lords. Blake was employed as a member of the security and intelligence services for seventeen years, from 1944 to 1961. In 1951, he became an agent for the Soviet Union. From then until 1960, he disclosed valuable secret information and documents gained through his employment. In 1961 he pleaded guilty to five charges of unlawfully communicating information contrary to the Official Secrets Act 1911 and was sentenced to 42 years' imprisonment. That case revolved around the autobiographical writings of Blake, a notorious spy. Certain sums of money were to be paid in stages to Blake as royalty. What had happened was that the Crown (which was the former employer of Blake) sought to stop the final payment and sought an order for it to instead be paid to the Crown. Court proceedings were brought by the Crown both in public and private law which included among others a claim in breach of confidence. Whilst the claim in private law failed, the claim in public law was successful and the Crown was successful in obtaining an order for payment so as to prevent Blake from receiving money whilst being in breach of the Official Secrets Act 1989. On the point that an innocent party in a sale and purchase agreement was entitled to accounts for profits obtained by the defaulting party who was in breach of the agreement, Lord Nicholls said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[141]</b> In the later part of his speech, Lord Nicholls emphasised that an account of profits as a remedy for breach of contract will be suitable only in exceptional circumstances:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[142]</b> Three points must be noted here. The first is that as can be seen from the very outset the order to account for profits in <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i> was in itself unusual due to the peculiar nature of the case. The House of Lord felt strongly that a self-confessed traitor should not benefit from his crime. Secondly, it must be taken into account of the fact that the remedy sought for an account of profits was only awarded as the Crown's other causes of action and normal remedies seemed inadequate in light of the conduct of Blake. Thirdly, Lord Nicholls made it quite clear that an account of profits was only to be made in exceptional cases where and only if normal remedies are inadequate. The Crown in that case could not prove any loss under the usual compensatory measures, hence the order to account was made therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[143]</b> In our judgment the case of <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i> should be distinguished on its facts. We agree with the submission of learned counsel for the defendant that the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to consider adequately that the facts of the present case were clearly within the ambit of an alleged breach of contract under which other remedies for the alleged breach of the SPA are readily available. We noted that apart from stating that the facts of <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i> were exceptional, the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to justify such a finding. It is quite plain to us that the present case revolved around an alleged breach of contract and there was nothing exceptional about it. It was a purely commercial undertaking that is common in the business world. Hence, we agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the defendant to the effect that the principle under which the order or relief was made in the <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i> is inapplicable to the facts of this case. For that reason, the majority of the Court of Appeal fell into error in applying <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i> in making an order for an account of profits in favour of the plaintiff. This was plainly wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[144]</b> Likewise, in our view, the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in failing to recognise that to make an order for an account of profits, it will have to be shown by the plaintiff that the profits were brought about by breach of contract. In the present case, the defendant would have made these profits had it paid the purchase price in time so that the SPA would have been concluded. Viewed in this way, they are therefore not net profits gained by the breach of contract. There was therefore no justification in law or equity to grant the order for an account of profits against the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[145]</b> On the question of whether the defendant was a trespasser and what relief the plaintiff should be entitled to for the defendant's occupation on the land, the majority of the Court of Appeal made the following crucial findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[146]</b> In our judgment based on the findings made by the majority of the Court of Appeal above that the construction in itself was lawful, the defendant was, until the validity of the termination of the SPA was settled, in possession of a beneficial interest on the land capable of registration and was not a trespasser. The majority of the Court of Appeal, however, did not address the status of the defendant but instead proceeded to make an order for an account of profits and placed heavy reliance on the case of <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i> even though, as we have held earlier, the principal stated in that case does not apply to the facts of the present case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[147]</b> The majority of the Court of Appeal also referred two cases of <i>Haves v. Ross (No 3)</i> [1919] NZLR 786 and <i>Martin v. Finch</i> [1923] NZLR 570 in support of the proposition that the court ought to order the defendant to account for the rental income and sale proceeds of the units constructed on the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[148]</b> In <i>Haves v. Ross (No 3) (supra)</i>, the plaintiff, who had let the defendant into possession of land under an agreement for sale and purchase, sued for rescission of the contract on the ground of the failure of a substantial part of the consideration. The plaintiff also claimed for the defendant's use and occupation of the property, for its deterioration through his acts and omissions, and for the amount of commission paid to the agent who negotiated the sale. Judgment having been given for rescission of the agreement, it was, among others, held by the Supreme Court of New Zealand that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation in the nature of rent for the period of the defendant's occupation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[149]</b> In <i>Martin v. Finch (supra)</i>, the plaintiff as vendor, and the defendant as purchaser, entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of certain land. The plaintiff received a deposit of £100, and a further sum of £150 on account of the purchase-money. The defendant made such default under his contract as precluded him from demanding the transfer of the estate. He alone was responsible for the purchase not being completed. The plaintiff rescinded the agreement, and there was no resale. It was admitted that the sum of £150 would have to be paid back. The defendant went into the possession of the property shortly after the making of the contract, and he or his tenants continued in occupation up to the date of judgment. The Supreme Court of New Zealand held that the defendant had forfeited the amount of the deposit and the plaintiff was entitled to retain it. It was also held that that the plaintiff should get compensation in the nature of rent computed for the period during which the defendant had been in occupation of the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[150]</b> Therefore, as submitted by learned counsel for the defendant, both the cases above do not support the proposition advanced by the majority of the Court of Appeal. On the contrary, both the cases actually ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff compensation in the nature of rent for the period of the defendant's occupation and there were no accounting of profits awarded. With all respect, the majority of the Court of Appeal was patently wrong in applying the above cases in holding that the defendant was liable to account for profits derived from its use and occupation of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[151]</b> More significant still, as a matter of general principle, it is settled that relief for account for profits would only be awarded in instances where it is established that there has been a breach of fiduciary duty (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_115;"><i>Mohd Zain Yusoff &amp; Ors v. Avel Consultants Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 115</LINK>; [2006] 6 MLJ 314; [2006] 4 CLJ 31; [2006] 5 AMR 489, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_563;"><i>Tengku Abdullah Ibni Sultan Abu Bakar &amp; Ors v. Mohd Latiff Shah Mohd &amp; Ors &amp; Other Appeals</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 563</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 265; [1997] 2 CLJ 607; [1996] 2 AMR 2633 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_208;"><i>Avel Consultants Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Mohd Zain Yusof &amp; Ors</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 208</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 209; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 37; [1996] 2 AMR 1866).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[152]</b> In <i>Mohd Zain Yusoff &amp; Ors v. Avel Consultants Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 115, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[153]</b> In the present case there was no fiduciary relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff. An order to account for profits is contrary to established principles of law where it is settled that relief for account for profits would only be awarded in instances where it is established that there has been a breach of fiduciary duty. This point was ignored by the majority of the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[154]</b> Finally, we come now to the case of <i>Ministry of Defence v. Ashman</i> [1993] 66 P &amp; CR 195 relied by learned counsel for the defendant to contend that the defendant was entitled to subjectively devalue the compensation payable and/ or benefits/profits gained or generated from the occupation of the land. We do not agree with this contention. In the first place, as pointed out by learned counsel for the plaintiff, the principles set out in <i>Ministry of Defence v. Ashman (supra)</i> follow on from earlier case, namely <i>Swordheath Properties v. Tabet</i> [1979] 1 WLR 258 where Megaw LJ approved a passage in <i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> which stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In another part of his judgment, Megaw LJ set out the approach to be adopted by a court assessing damages for trespass as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[155]</b> Coming back to the case of <i>Ministry of Defence v. Ashman (supra)</i>, the brief facts are that the Ashman family lived in the married quarters of the Ministry of Defence. This privilege was valid as long as Mr Ashman continued to stay in the quarters as he was an employee of the Ministry of Defence. In 1991, Mr Ashman left his family and moved out. However, the family continued to occupy the quarters as there was no alternative accommodation available. The Ministry of Defence commenced proceedings against Mrs Ashman seeking possession and mesne profits for trespass. Mrs Ashman subsequently got alternative accommodation, ie a flat, from the local authority which was let out at a substantial discount compared to market rate. Hoffman LJ held that Mrs Ashman would not have stayed in the quarters at market rate rent if she had a choice. Since being evicted from the quarters, she was able to get a flat from the local authority. As such, Hoffman LJ held the value of the quarters was no more than what Mrs Ashman would have had to pay for suitable local authority housing if this was available immediately.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[156]</b> There are three points that must be noted here. First, as pointed out by learned counsel for the Plaintiff, the principles as set out in <i>Ministry of Defence v. Ashman (supra)</i> were not raised in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Secondly, the defendant did not provide any evidence about its "subjective devaluation" analysis; and thirdly, <i>Ministry of Defence v. Ashman (supra)</i> case is about residential property and the assessment of damages. The case involved the wife of an officer in the Armed forces who was getting divorced, and whose husband had left her living as trespasser in married quarters. In that case, the English Court of Appeal was considering the issue of tenant of residential property that was paying a lower rent than charged commercially due to government subsidies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[157]</b> We therefore agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the plaintiff that the principle from the case of <i>Ministry of Defence v. Ashman (supra)</i> is distinguishable and it is not applicable to the facts of the present case. The facts in that case were exceptionally different from the present case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[158]</b> In the present case, the special clause in the SPA and the PA gave the defendant immediate possession of the land upon payment of the deposit and allowing it to build the mall before the balance of the purchase price was paid. More than that, the majority of the Court of Appeal itself made a finding that the defendant's conduct of continuing with its occupation of the land and constructing the mall was lawful. The irresistible deduction to be drawn is that had the defendant known that it did not have good title to the land, it would most certainly not have proceeded to spend large sums of money in improving the land by building the mall on it. In the circumstance, we conclude that the plaintiff is only entitled for the market rent of the unimproved Land and not for an account of profits as held by <i>Attorney General v. Blake (supra)</i>.</p>
