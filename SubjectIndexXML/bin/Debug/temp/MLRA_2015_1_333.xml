    <p>The appellant was the executor and trustee to the estate of the deceased. The deceased, prior to her death on 5 September 2010, had charged her property to the respondent. The appellant informed the respondent by letter dated 19 October 2010 about her status as executrix but on 13 March 2011, the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings against the property, naming only the deceased's estate. A third-party was subsequently made a 2nd defendant in the proceedings. The appellant claimed that the 2nd defendant was a fraud. The respondent did not dispute such status of the 2nd defendant but asserted that since he had been added in by way of a court order, the respondent's acts were regular. The property was sold by auction to one Talata Ventures Sdn Bhd ("Talata") on a 10% deposit and completion through payment of balance within 120 days. However, Talata could not complete the sale in time and with the 2nd defendant's consent sought and obtained an extension of time to pay the balance, from the Senior Assistant Registrar. The appellant contended that this extension was bad in law. The appellant who had been granted probate, had placed a caveat on the property and applied to set aside the order for sale. The High Court ruled that the appellant had no <i>locus standi</i> in the proceedings and the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The judge had erred in concluding that the appellant who had been granted probate had no <i>locus standi</i>. Where the deceased dies with an executor and/ or executrix to his will, locus starts from the minute of the deceased's death. (para 13(a))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondent had not strictly complied with the procedural safeguards and there was non-compliance with the strict statutory provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code</LINK>. The court was thus required to allow the appellant's application to set aside the order for sale. (para 13(b))</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, one of the executrix and trustees of the estate of Mahadevi a/p Nadchatiram's (deceased) appealed against the decision of the learned High Court Judge, who had refused to set aside the order for sale in respect of a foreclosure proceeding came up for hearing on 19 February 2014 and we reserved judgment to another date. My learned brothers Azahar Mohamed JCA and Mohtarudin Baki JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The deceased had charged her property to the respondent. The deceased died on 5 September 2010. The plaintiff on 13 March 2011 commenced foreclosure proceedings against the property naming only the deceased's estate. [See pp 22 to 26 A/R]. Subsequently, a person named as Mahamandelesh Warar Resanand was allowed to intervene and made the 2nd defendant in the action. However, the executrix had informed the plaintiff by a letter dated 19 October 2010 about her status as executrix; that too nearly two years before the foreclosure proceedings were commenced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The learned counsel for the appellant says the 2nd defendant whom the plaintiff made a party for the action is a fraud and the court has granted probate to the executrix and trustees of the estate namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The property which was charged was sold by auction to Talata Ventures Sdn Bhd (Talata) for RM3.2 million by the Senior Assistant Registrar (SAR) and the sale was to be completed within 120 days with a payment of 10% deposit. Talata had paid the 10% deposit but was not able to complete the sale within 120 days. The plaintiff with the consent of the 2nd defendant had, by an order of the SAR, given an extension of time to pay by the purchaser. This order of extension the appellant says is bad in law and the SAR has no power or jurisdiction to grant the extension and the appellant says the deposit sum should have been forfeited on account of the deceased's estate and a fresh auction procedure should be convened pursuant to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code (NLC)</LINK>. [See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267A.;;">s 267A of NLC</LINK>].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It is not in dispute that the appellant had served encl 30 on Talata who has already paid the balance purchase price to the plaintiff. Talata had chosen not to intervene in the High Court proceeding as well as this appeal. The appellant has also placed a caveat on the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The more difficult part to comprehend in this case is that notwithstanding the fact the appellant had been granted probate and the fact the deceased's estate is the 1st defendant or now the sole defendant in the case, the learned High Court Judge had ruled that the appellant had no <i>locus standi</i> in the proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It must be emphasised that the position of the executor or executrix to sue or to be sued is different from the position of the administrator or administratrix. An executor is a person appointed by a testator to carry out the directions and requests in his will, and to dispose of the property according to his testamentary provisions after the testator's death. However, an administrator need not be a person appointed by will but is appointed by the court to administer the assets and liabilities of the deceased and thereafter to distribute the same to the next of kin of the deceased. It is trite that unlike an administrator, the executor can sue before probate is extracted. In <i>Meyappa Chetty v. Subramaniam Chetty</i> [1916] AC 603, Lord Parker observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The question whether an executor can be sued before a grant of probate is extracted was also considered in the case of <i>Mohamidu Mohideen Hadjiar v. Pitchey</i> [1894] AC 437.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned High Court Judge as a matter of prudence had proceeded to hear the merits of the application and finally dismissed the said encl 30 which <i>inter alia</i> read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The learned counsel for the respondent in the submission does not really dispute the appellant's submission on the issue that time cannot be extended by SAR and it was in breach of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> and in consequence the order of sale to Talata ought to be set aside. The learned counsel in essence says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned counsel also concedes the 2nd defendant is a fraudster and/ or <i>de son tort</i> in the submission which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have read the appeal record and the submission of the parties in detail. The court is grateful to the comprehensive submission of the learned counsel. After much consideration to the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent, we take the view that this is a fit and proper case to allow the appeal. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> For reasons stated above the appeal is allowed with costs to the appellant here and below, with the following orders and/or directions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The plaintiff to pay costs of RM20,000.00 here and below to the appellant. The deposit to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
