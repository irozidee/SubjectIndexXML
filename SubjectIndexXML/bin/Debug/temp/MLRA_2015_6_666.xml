      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>Both the instant appeals were brought by Tenaga Nasional Berhad ('Tenaga'). In the first appeal, the respondent (Ternakan Air Wui Kyee Sdn Bhd) had sued Tenaga for threatening to disrupt its electricity supply and for defamation. Tenaga had counterclaimed for loss of revenue as a result of a 'tampered meter' pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990</LINK> ('ESA'). The trial judge dismissed both the respondent's claim and Tenaga's counterclaim. Tenaga appealed against the dismissal of its counterclaim. In the second appeal, Tenaga claimed against the respondent (EE-Lian Plastic Industries Sdn Bhd) for loss of revenue due to a 'tampered meter' pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of the ESA</LINK>. Tenaga's claim was dismissed and it appealed to the Court of Appeal. Both appeals were predicated upon the single issue of whether a conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;sectionno.;;">s 37(1), (3) or (14) of the ESA</LINK> was required as a pre-condition before Tenaga was able to commence a civil claim for loss of revenue due to meter tampering, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of ESA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing both appeals):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> A common sense approach must also be taken into account when it relates to commercial matters. In both the appeals herein, the contract for electricity supply was commercial in nature. It would be abhorrent to justice and fair play for the court to condone a consumer who has benefitted from a tampered meter to escape payment to Tenaga for it electricity usage. (paras 17-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Section 38 of the ESA relates to a civil action. It has nothing to do with a criminal action. Reading <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38</LINK> as a whole, it is clear that Parliament intended a simple procedure to disconnect electricity supply under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(1) of the ESA</LINK> and pursue Tenaga's claim for the loss of revenue by issuing a statement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4) of the ESA</LINK>, without any need for Tenaga to resort to court to take legal action to disconnect the electricity supply. When the claim is for loss of revenue, then the consumer is obliged to pay as per the statement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK>. However, if the consumer objects to liability or quantum, then Tenaga has very little choice but to proceed with a civil suit to recover the sum for loss of revenue, where the burden of proof is on the balance of probabilities unless the exception applies. (para 19(i)-(iii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Commission in criminal jurisprudence relates to the fact that the elements of the offence are complete. It does not matter at that stage who committed the offence. In practice, once there is evidence of commission of an offence, the police will investigate and charge the person and upon proof, the court will convict. Commission is the starting point of a crime and conviction is the end. Thus, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK>, the burden for Tenaga is a light one to show a commission of an offence. In civil cases it must be limited to a balance of probabilities only. (para 19(iv))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> When there are two possible views, as reflected in the many cases cited in the instant appeals in the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">38(3) to (5)</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38</LINK> itself, the view that will promote justice must be the paramount consideration of the court. When interpreting a statute, the court will not merely confine itself to the literal rule or the purposive rule. (para 19(vi))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> A conviction is not necessary to pursue a claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) to (5) of the ESA</LINK>. (para 20)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Tenaga) has two appeals before us. The first Appeal No is A-02-572-2011 and the respondent is Ternakan Air Wui Kyee Sdn Bhd (Ternakan). In the first appeal, Tenaga is the defendant and had brought a counterclaim against Ternakan for loss of revenue as a result of 'tampered meter', pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of Electricity Supply Act 1990 (ESA 1990)</LINK>. The Ternakan's claim against Tenaga was related to the threat of disruption of electricity supply and/or disruption, defamation, etc. The learned trial judge has dismissed Ternakan's claim as well as Tenaga's counterclaim. The first appeal is in respect of Tenaga's appeal on the counterclaim only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In the second Appeal No: P-02(NCVC)(W)-201-01-2013, Tenaga, the appellant was the plaintiff and EE-Lian Plastic Industries Sdn Bhd (EE-Lian) was the defendant. Tenaga's claim for loss of revenue for the 'tampered meter' pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38 of ESA 1990</LINK> was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Both the appeals can be conveniently disposed off upon the determination of one issue namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned counsel for the appellant says conviction is not necessary and the learned counsel for the respondent says conviction is necessary. There are a number of cases in support of both proposition though the Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_4_257;"><i>WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd v. Tenaga Nasional Bhd</i> [2012] 4 MLRA 257</LINK>; [2012] 4 MLJ 296; [2012] 4 CLJ 478 deals with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK> only and not <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) to (5)</LINK>. The learned counsel for the respondent before us argues that the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK> should not be applied for the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3)</LINK>. The appellant says, a section must be read as a whole and must not be read disjunctively. The appellant asserts the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(1)</LINK> made by the Federal Court must be followed in interpreting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) of ESA 1990</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> After hearing lengthy submissions of parties, we reserved judgment. My learned brother Balia Yusof Wahi JCA and my learned sister Badariah Sahamid JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>First Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Tenaga's defence and counterclaim can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We must say that Tenaga's defence and counterclaim are very brief and there was no prayer for interest or costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned trial judge's judgment was equally brief. The learned trial judge agrees that the statement of loss of revenue given in evidence is <i>prima facie</i> evidence as per <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4) of ESA 1990</LINK> for loss of revenue, but dismissed the counterclaim on the ground that Tenaga did not lead evidence to show who had caused the tampering of the meter. The judgment impliedly confirms that the meter had been tampered with to attract <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37(1), (3) or (14) of ESA 1990</LINK>, and to show that an offence had been committed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The only question for determination in this appeal is whether there must be conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37(1) or (3)</LINK> or (14) to recover loss of revenue pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) to (5)</LINK> and whether the person convicted must be the consumer, ie Ternakan, the respondent in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Second Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Tenaga's claim is similar to the counterclaim in the 1st appeal. Tenaga's claim can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The statement of claim in the second appeal was comprehensive that not only Tenaga's claim can survive under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) to (5) of ESA 1990</LINK>, but also under contract and/or tort, for tampering with the electricity meter and causing loss of revenue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> If the action is to be based purely on contract and/or tort, then Tenaga cannot rely on the statutory statement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> of which will stand as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of quantum of loss of revenue. If <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> is relied upon, it does not stop the defendant from challenging quantum as well as liability. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">Sections 38(3) to (5)</LINK> only give some evidential advantage to Tenaga and does not discharge the legal burden to prove its claim when quantum as well as liability is challenged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In the instant second appeal, the learned trial judge in judgment has confirmed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The question to be determined in the second appeal is the same as the first appeal. That is to say, whether there must be conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37(1), (3) or (14)</LINK> to recover loss of revenue pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) to (5) of ESA 1990</LINK>, and whether the person convicted must be the consumer concerned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In essence, both appeals deal with same issues for purpose of final disposal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">Section 38 ESA 1990</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned counsel for the appellant had submitted not less than ten cases which support the proposition that a conviction is not necessary and four cases which say a conviction is necessary. However, there is a difference in view whether the consumer himself must be convicted to pursue a claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) to (5)</LINK>. The references of the cases are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We do not want to go into the nitty-gritty of arguments relating to statutory interpretation when courts have stated that a common sense approach must also be taken into account when it relates to commercial matters. Support for the abovementioned proposition is found in a number of cases. To name a few are as follows: (i) <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_53;"><i>Keng Soon Finance Bhd v. MK Retnam Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 53</LINK>; [1989] 1 MLJ 457; [1989] 1 CLJ 1; (ii) <i>Comandate Marine Corp v. Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd</i> [2006] FCAPC 192.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In both cases herein, even though the statute covers the relationship between Tenaga and the consumer, the contract for electricity supply is indeed commercial in nature. It will be abhorrent to justice and fair play for the court to condone a consumer who has benefited from a tampered meter to escape payment to Tenaga for its electricity usage. Similar issues relating to justice and tampering of meter relating to Tenaga was considered by the Court of Appeal, coram consisting of Abdul Wahab Patail JCA, Balia Yusof Wahi JCA and Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_2_688;"><i>Tenaga Nasional Berhad v. AWP Enterprise (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2015] 2 MLRA 688</LINK>; [2015] 3 MLJ 268; [2015] 1 CLJ 400. The concept of justice, equity and good conscience is part of our jurisprudence and was applied in the privy council decision of <i>Kenchana Kom Sanyellappa Hosmani and Another v.

      <b>[19]</b> We have read both the appeal records and able submissions of the parties. We are grateful for the comprehensive submission. After giving much consideration to the submissions of the counsel for Ternakan and EE-Lian, we take the view that both the appeals of Tenaga must be allowed. Our reasons, <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> For the reasons stated above, we hold that a conviction is not necessary to pursue a claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) to (5) of ESA 1990</LINK>. In consequence, both the appeals are allowed with costs of RM20,000.00 each for here and below to be paid by the respondents to the appellant. In the first appeal, judgment is entered for Tenaga's counterclaim in the sum of RM53,169.80. For the second appeal, judgment is entered for Tenaga's claim in the sum of RM1,027,888.76 with interest at 5% per annum from the date of writ to the date of realisation.</p>

      <b>[21]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
