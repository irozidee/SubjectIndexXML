    <p>The 2nd respondent owned a piece of land upon which 621 units of low cost flats were built. The 1st respondent/plaintiff agreed to purchase 18 units ("the units") for RM613,000. The plaintiff paid an earnest deposit of RM10,000 to the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant agreed to refund the deposit to the plaintiff if approval was required for the transfer of the units and if such approval was not obtained. The plaintiff appointed the 2nd defendant as solicitors in respect of the sale and purchase transactions of the units. At all material times, the 3rd defendant was a partner of the 2nd defendant. The appellants/2nd and 3rd defendants prepared the sales and purchase agreements and relevant documents in respect of the units. However, the transfers in respect of the units could not be registered in the Land Office due to the absence of a consent letter from the Lembaga Perumahan dan Hartanah Selangor ("LPHS") - which consent was necessary for all transactions involving low cost properties. The plaintiff sued the 1st defendant for breach of contract and the 2nd and 3rd defendants for professional negligence. The 2nd and 3rd defendants counterclaimed against the plaintiff for defamation and issued a third party notice against the 2nd respondent for indemnity and contribution in respect of any liability of the 2nd and 3rd defendants to the plaintiff. Later, consent judgment was entered into between the plaintiff and defendants wherein the plaintiff and 1st defendant agreed that the sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant was null and void and unenforceable. The 1st defendant, without admission of liability, also agreed to refund and pay the plaintiff the full purchase price paid, damages and costs. The plaintiff agreed to deliver vacant possession of the units on full payment as agreed by the 1st defendant. In the High Court, the Judicial Commissioner after trial allowed the plaintiff's claim against the 2nd and 3rd defendants for professional negligence, dismissed the 1st and 2nd defendants' counterclaim for defamation and dismissed the 2nd and 3rd defendants' third party notice for indemnity or contribution against the 2nd respondent. The 2nd and 3rd defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal but dismissing the appeal on defamation and indemnity and affirming the High Court's decision in dismissing the 2nd and 3rd defendants' counterclaim for defamation; dismissing the plaintiff's cross-appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The consent judgment had expressly provided that the SPA in respect of the units was to be declared null and void. The effect of such declaration was that the plaintiff was restored to the original position before the signing of the SPA. Pursuant to the terms of the consent judgment, the plaintiff had been awarded compensation by a full refund of the purchase price of the units as well as agreed costs and damages. Since the basis of the plaintiff's claim against the 2nd and 3rd defendants was the alleged negligence in respect of the SPA and the SPA had been declared null and void, there was no basis for the plaintiff's suit against the 2nd and 3rd defendants. Likewise, the appeal of the 2nd and 3rd defendants against the 2nd respondent as third party for the indemnity premised on the void SPA was not tenable. (paras 62-63)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was an abuse of the process of court for the plaintiff to pursue the suit when the plaintiff had been duly compensated by the terms of the consent judgment. It would certainly be unjust to allow the plaintiff to make a double claim for what was essentially the same cause of action against the same parties. <i>Seruan Gemilang Makmur Sdn Bhd v. Badan Perhubungan UMNO Negeri Pahang Darul Makmur (folld)</i>. (para 64)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> On perusal of the evidence before the court, there was insufficient evidence of a breach of professional duty by the appellants. In any event since the consent judgment had duly compensated the plaintiff, the plaintiff had not suffered any losses for which a cause of action would lie. (paras 65-66)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> As for the plaintiff's cross-appeal against the defendants on damages, in accepting the compensation, damages and costs stipulated in the consent judgment, the plaintiff had forfeited his rights to the other heads of damages pleaded in para 50(e) of his statement of claim. (para 68)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> There are appeals before us from a decision of the High Court of Shah Alam in Civil Suit No: 22 NCVC-879-07/2012 on the plaintiff's claim and the defendants' counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 8 January 2014, the learned Judicial Commissioner had allowed a part of the plaintiff's claim against the 2nd and 3rd defendants for professional negligence in respect of the sale and purchase of 18 units of low cost flats, damages and costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner also dismissed the 2nd and 3rd defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiff for defamation. The 2nd and 3rd defendants' claim against the third party for indemnity or contribution to liability was also dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The 2nd and 3rd defendants (1st and 2nd appellants) have appealed against the decision on the plaintiff's claim. The 2nd and 3rd defendants have also appealed on the dismissal of their counterclaim for defamation as well as their claim against the third party for indemnity or contribution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The plaintiff has also filed a notice of cross-appeal against part of the decision of the High Court in rejecting the plaintiff's claim for:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The 2nd respondent was a licensed Developer and registered owner of a piece of land held under GRN 44070, Lot No: 40352 and GRN 44073, Lot No: 40357, Mukim Damansara, District of Petaling, Selangor ("the said land"). A housing project, known as Taman Bunga Negara ("the housing project") comprising 621 units of low cost flats were built on the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The plaintiff agreed on the purchase price of RM613,000.00 for 18 units of flats of the housing project ("the properties"). On 5 April 2007, the plaintiff paid the earnest deposit of RM10,000.00 to Oriental Summit Industries Sdn Bhd ("the 1st defendant") for the purchase of the properties. The plaintiff and the 1st defendant had agreed that if approval was required for the transfer of the properties and the said approval is not obtained, the deposit would be refunded to the plaintiff without interest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff appointed the 2nd defendant as solicitors in respect of the sale and purchase transactions of the properties. At all material times the 3rd defendant was and is a partner of the 2nd defendant. The 2nd and 3rd defendants prepared the sales and purchase agreements and relevant documents in respect of the properties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Subsequently, by a letter dated 19 Spetember 2007, the 2nd defendant wrote to the 2nd respondent requesting confirmation of any restrictions on the transfer of the properties as well as any existing encumbrances on the properties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> By a letter dated 24 September 2007, the 2nd respondent responded to the 2nd defendant's letter abovementioned, confirming that there were no restrictions in respect of transfer of the properties and that the properties were free of encumbrances. The 2nd respondent had enclosed a copy of the Master Title to the said land as supporting documentation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 29 October 2007, the 2nd defendant forwarded the balance purchase price of RM551,700.00 to the 1st defendant's solicitors, Messrs Pakhruddin &amp; Partners as stakeholders. The Sale and Purchase Agreements in respect of the properties were dated 21 November 2007 and duly stamped on 23 November 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> By a letter dated 4 August 2008 from Lembaga Perumahan dan Hartanah Selangor ("LPHS") in reply to Messrs Pakhruddin &amp; Partners' letter of 26 March 2008, which letter was copied to the 2nd defendant, it was stated that all transactions involving low cost properties, including the properties require the consent of LPHS. The same letter also listed the requirements for eligibility to purchase low cost property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 4 Spetember 2009, individual strata titles for the properties were issued by Pejabat Tanah dan Galian Selangor ("PTGS").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The 2nd defendant advised the plaintiff to execute Memorandums of Transfers (MOT) for registration in favour of the plaintiff. On 30 December 2010, the 2nd defendant presented the MOT to PTGS for registration. However, on 5 December 2011, PTGS rejected the registration of the MOT due to the absence of a consent letter from LPHS as required by its letter of 8 November 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Subsequently, by a writ of summons dated 12 July 2012, the plaintiff instituted an action against the defendants for the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The 2nd and 3rd defendants instituted the following actions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> By a consent judgment dated 7 November 2012 entered into between the plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants, it was <i>inter alia</i> agreed between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant that the Sale and Purchase Agreement ("SPA") dated 21 November 2007 between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, is void and unenforceable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The 1st defendant, without admission of liability, also agreed to refund to the plaintiff the full purchase price of RM613,000.00. The 1st defendant also agreed to pay damages as well as costs to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In addition, the plaintiff agreed to deliver vacant possession of the properties on full payment of the stipulated amount abovementioned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> After trial of the suit, the learned Judicial Commissioner on 8 January 2014 had decided as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Appellants' Submissions On 1st Respondent's Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abuse Of Process</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The appellants submit that the learned High Court Judge erred in not taking into consideration the consent judgment entered into between the plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants. Pursuant to the consent judgment it was <i>inter alia</i> agreed between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant that the SPA dated 21 November 2007 between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant is void and unenforceable. As such the issue of damages does not arise. The appellants referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_1_485;"><i>Wing Fah Enterprise Sdn Bhd v. Matsushita Electronic Components (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2011] 1 MLRH 485</LINK>; [2011] 9 MLJ 320; [2011] 8 CLJ 111 as authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Pursuant to the consent judgment, the 1st defendant had also agreed to refund to the plaintiff the full purchase price of RM613,000. In addition the 1st defendant also agreed to pay damages as well as costs to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Since the 1st respondent has been compensated by the terms of the consent judgment, there are no existing losses suffered and consequently the 1st respondent's claim should be dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the plaintiff's statement of claim, the same subject matter as well as the same relief had been pleaded. Thus it is an abuse of the process for the 1st respondent to pursue the suit in light of the consent judgment between the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The appellants referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_7_335;"><i>Seruan Gemilang Makmur Sdn Bhd v. Badan Perhubungan UMNO Negeri Pahang Darul Makmur</i> [2009] 7 MLRH 335</LINK>; [2010] 8 MLJ 57 as authority for the proposition that it is an abuse of the process of court if the plaintiff were to be permitted, "to relitigate their cause for the same relief and based on the same subject matter for which the plaintiffs have successfully obtained a judgment after a full trial".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The appellants argue that applying the above principle to the instant case, since the 1st respondent had obtained a consent judgment in respect of the same subject matter and for the same relief, it would be an abuse of process to allow the 1st respondent to make a double claim in the suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The appellants further submit that by the terms of the consent judgment the 1st respondent was paid damages and had relinquished his rights to claim for the other damages stipulated in para 50(e) of the plaintiff's statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In addition, since the consent judgment was recorded with the 1st respondent and the appellants, the 1st respondent is precluded from proceeding with his claim against the appellants. As authority the appellants have cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_7_403;"><i>Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd v. How Boon Seng &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 7 MLRH 403</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Professional Negligence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The appellants submit further that the High Court Judge had erred in making a finding that the appellants had breached their professional duty of care to the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is not disputed that the appellants had acted on behalf of the 1st respondent in the sale and purchase of the properties and thus owe the 1st respondent a duty of care. However, it is the appellants' contention that there has been no breach of a duty of care to the 1st respondent. At all material times the appellants had performed their duties in accordance with the standard expected of a legal practitioner, as set out in the cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_1_730;"><i>Lee Chee Kiang v. Johnson Tan Teck Seng &amp; Anor</i> [2011] 1 MLRH 730</LINK>; [2011] 8 MLJ 297; [2011] 9 CLJ 498 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_763;"><i>Foo Fio Na v. Dr Soo Fook Mun &amp; Anor</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 129; [2002] 2 CLJ 11; [2002] 2 AMR 1524.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The appellants contend that the appellants had advised the 1st respondent on the requirement for prior consent from LPHS before the transfer of land can be completed. The appellants had taken measures to protect the interest of the 1st respondent by inserting a clause in the sale and purchase agreement (cl 3 and Item 12 para (ii) of the First Schedule) that the balance purchase price is to be paid to the 1st defendant upon receipt of the consent to transfer from the State authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In addition, by a letter dated 19 September 2007, the appellants had sought confirmation from the 2nd respondent as to whether there was any restriction in interest imposed by the relevant authorities. The 2nd respondent had responded by a letter dated 24 September 2007 that there is no restriction on the transfer of the properties and that the properties were free of encumbrances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In any event the appellants contend that the obligation to obtain the consent of LPHS is that of the 1st defendant/vendor. Since the 1st defendant was represented by their own solicitors, Messrs Pakhruddin &amp; Partners, it is their duty to obtain the consent from LPHS. The appellants had written numerous letters to Messrs Pakhruddin &amp; Partners to enquire on the status of the application for consent and the application for waiver of consent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Thus the appellants contend that the appellants had discharged their professional duties to the 1st respondent and are not liable for the failure of the 1st respondent to register the transfer for lack of the required consent from LPHS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The appellants further submit that even if the 1st respondent had suffered losses, such losses were not caused by the appellants but by the 1st respondent's own action. The 1st respondent had, contrary to the appellants' advice and terms of the SPA, paid the balance of the purchase price to the 1st defendant's solicitors in order to take early vacant possession of the properties and enjoy rental income even though the properties had yet to be transferred to the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>1st Respondent's Reply</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Consent Judgment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The 1st respondent's written submission dated 16 October 2014 did not address the issue of the consent judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In oral submissions, in reply to the appellants on the issue of consent judgment, the 1st respondent had distinguished the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_7_335;"><i>Seruan Gemilang Makmur Sdn Bhd v. Badan Perhubungan UMNO Negeri Pahang Darul Makmur</i> [2009] 7 MLRH 335</LINK>; [2010] 8 MLJ 57, in that the case cited relate to a previous civil suit while the instant case relate to a consent judgment between the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Professional Negligence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The crux of the 1st respondent's submissions on this issue centred on the High Court's finding that the appellants had breached their professional duty of care to the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The 1st respondent submits that the facts demonstrate that all the elements of negligence had been proven, the appellants owe the 1st respondent a professional duty of care, the appellants had breached such duty of care, in consequence of which the 1st respondent had incurred losses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The breach of duty consists in the appellants' failure to verify with LPHS the status of the property before entering the sale and purchase agreement. The appellants were aware that there was a restriction in interest on the properties and that a prior consent of LPHS was a prerequisite to registration. Notwithstanding the above, the appellants had advised the 1st respondent to present a Memorandum of Transfer to PTGS. Acting on the appellants' advice, the 1st respondent had made payment of the balance purchase price of RM551,700.00 to the 1st defendant via their solicitors Messrs Pakhruddin &amp; Partners.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The appellants had thereby breached their duty according to the standard of duty of care of a reasonably competent practitioner. Among the cases cited on the appropriate standard of care are the following: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1967_1_101;"><i>Swamy v. Matthews &amp; Anor</i> [1967] 1 MLRA 101</LINK>; [1967] 1 MLJ 142 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_861;"><i>Victor Cham &amp; Anor v.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The appellants' counterclaim comprises of:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Defamation Against The 1st Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The appellants submit that the 1st respondent had committed defamation in that the 1st respondent/plaintiff 's statements of claim which contain particulars of the appellants' negligence were defamatory and had been published to non-intended parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The appellants submit the defence of qualified privilege does not apply in the circumstances as the appellants had failed to serve the writ and statement of claim to the appellants personally, resulting in the said documents reaching parties other than the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Indemnity Against The 2nd Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The appellants submit that if the appellants were found liable for professional negligence, the appellants would be entitled to claim indemnity or contribution from the 2nd respondent because of the 2nd respondent's breach of duty. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;22D.;;">s 22D(4) of Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966</LINK>, the 2nd respondent owes a duty of care to the 1st respondent as the sale and purchase of the properties was a subsale between the 1st respondent and the 1st defendant. The 2nd respondent had breached its duty of care by a failure to verify the status of the property from LPHS and further by issuing a letter ('confirmation letter') dated 24 September 2007 to the appellants confirming <i>inter alia</i> that there are no restrictions to the transfer of the properties, and that the properties are free of encumbrances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The appellants submit that in reliance on the confirmation letter from the 2nd respondent, the balance of the purchase price of the properties was paid by the appellants to the 1st defendant's solicitors, Messrs Pakhruddin &amp; Partners.</p>
    <p>
      <b>1st Respondent's Reply</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Defamation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The 1st respondent submits that the particulars of the alleged negligence of the appellants in the 1st respondent/plaintiff's statement of claim were not defamatory, as the appellants had failed to discharge the burden of proof. In particular, the appellants had failed to adduce evidence to support the allegation that the defamatory remarks contained in the statement of claim had been served on other than the intended parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Even if found to be defamatory, the 1st respondent is entitled to rely on the defence of qualified privilege. The 1st respondent referred to the cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_1_506;"><i>Cornelius Jimbangan v. Joseph Crispin &amp; Anor; Michael Persius Ubu (Third Party)</i> [2009] 1 MLRH 506</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 82; [2009] 10 CLJ 87 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_2_33;"><i>Thiruchelvasegaram Manickavasegar v.

    <p>
      <b>2nd Respondent's Reply</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Indemnity</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The 2nd respondent denied any liability to indemnify or contribute to any liability of the 2nd and 3rd defendants to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The 2nd respondent had not breached its duty under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_118;22D.;;">s 22D(4) of Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966</LINK> in that the information provided to the appellants that there was no restriction in interest on the properties, and that there were no encumbrances therein was premised on the Master Title which was enclosed together with the 2nd respondent's letter of confirmation to the appellants dated 24 September 2007. Further the confirmation of the status of the properties was in accordance with land search results dated 23 May 2007 conducted by the appellants on the properties and admitted to by the 2nd appellant in cross-examination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The 2nd respondent was also unaware of the requirement for prior consent from LPHS for registration of transfer of the properties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The 2nd respondent is not liable for the alleged negligence of the appellants as the 2nd respondent has no control or is in any way involved or responsible for the actions and advice given by the appellants to the 1st respondent in respect of the sale and purchase of the properties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> After consideration of the appellants' and respondents' submissions, we are of the view that there are merits in the appeal and unanimously allowed the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> However, we dismissed the appellants' appeal on defamation and indemnity and affirmed the High Court's decision in dismissing the 2nd and 3rd defendants' counterclaim for defamation against the plaintiff, as well as the claim for contribution against the third party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> In addition we found no merits in the 1st respondent's appeal for additional damages as pleaded in para 50(e) of the 1st respondent/plaintiff 's statement of claim.</p>
    <p>The grounds of our decision are stated below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Consent Judgment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> On 7 November 2012, a consent judgment (P26) was entered into between the plaintiff/1st respondent, the 1st defendant/vendor, the 2nd defendant/1st appellant and the 3rd defendant/2nd appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The question that arises and in our opinion of crucial importance to the instant case is this: what is the effect of the consent judgment?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> On a comparative examination of the particulars of the plaintiff's statement of claim with the terms of the consent judgment, it is clear that both the plaintiff's suit and the consent judgment are in respect of the same subject matter and the same relief pleaded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The salient terms of the consent judgment are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In the grounds of judgment of the learned Judicial Commissioner, at para 24, reference was made to the consent judgment between the parties and the express provision therein that the SPA of 21 November 2007 is "batal dan tidak sah".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner made a finding that the effect of the invalidity is only to the extent of limiting the extent of the relief awarded to the plaintiff. Clearly the learned Judicial Commissioner had made an error in law on the effect in law of a contract that has been declared null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The consent judgment had expressly provided that the SPA in respect of the properties to be null and void. The effect of the declaration of nullity of the SPA in law is that the plaintiff is restored to the original position before the signing of the SPA. Pursuant to the terms of the consent judgment, the plaintiff/1st respondent had been awarded compensation by a full refund of the purchase price of the properties as well as agreed costs and damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Since the basis of the 1st respondent's claim against the appellants is the alleged negligence in respect of the SPA and the SPA has been declared null and void, there is no basis for the 1st respondent's suit against the appellants. Likewise, the appeal of the appellants against the 2nd respondent for indemnity premised on the void SPA is not tenable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> In addition, we agree with the submission of the appellants and the cited authority of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_7_335;"><i>Seruan Gemilang Makmur Sdn Bhd v. Badan Perhubungan UMNO Negeri Pahang Darul Makmur</i> [2009] 7 MLRH 335</LINK>; [2010] 8 MLJ 57, that it is an abuse of the process of court for the 1st respondent to pursue the suit when the 1st respondent had been duly compensated by the terms of the consent judgment. It would certainly be unjust to allow the 1st respondent to make a double claim for what is essentially the same cause of action against the same parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> In any event, on perusal of the evidence before us, we also find insufficient evidence of a breach of professional duty by the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In any event, since the 1st respondent has been duly compensated by the consent judgment, the 1st respondent has not suffered any losses for which a cause of action will lie.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> In the premises we allowed the appeal by the 1st and 2nd appellants against the 1st respondent and awarded costs of RM10,000.00 to the appellants. We also awarded costs of RM5,000.00 to the 2nd respondent on the appeal of the 1st and 2nd appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> In respect of the 1st respondent's cross-appeal against the appellants on damages, we agree with the appellants' submission that in accepting the compensation, damages and costs stipulated in the terms of the consent judgment, the 1st respondent has forfeited his rights to the other heads of damages pleaded in para 50(e) of the 1st respondent/plaintiff 's statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> We therefore dismissed the 1st respondent's cross-appeal.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
