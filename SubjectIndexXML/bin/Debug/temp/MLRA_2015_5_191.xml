    <p>The respondent/defendant appointed the appellant/plaintiff as Project Manager to manage a road upgrading project ("project") for it. The defendant was to manage the accounts for the project and to make payments to subcontractors for goods and materials supplied. The defendant was to be paid management fees for the services rendered in managing the project. Disputes arose and the plaintiff sued the defendant for unpaid management fees and financial advances given. The defendant not only disputed the claim but counterclaimed against the plaintiff, alleging the plaintiff had fraudulently paid itself instead of paying its subcontractors. The plaintiff asserted that the sums it paid itself was for set-offs or contra payments for goods and materials supplied to the subcontractors for the completion of the project. The trial judge dismissed both the plaintiff's claim and the defendant's counterclaim. The Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff's appeal against the dismissal of its claim but allowed the defendant's appeal against the dismissal of its counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed to the Federal Court. The main issue for the Federal Court's determination concerned the standard of proof required in a civil claim where fraud is alleged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the plaintiff's appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The term "burden of proof" relates to the burden or obligation of proving a fact on the party who asserts the existence of any fact in issue and wishes the Court to believe in its existence. The burden of proof on a party never shifts. The term "standard of proof" refers to the degree of persuasion which the tribunal must feel before it decides that the fact in issue did happen. (paras 5-6)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There is no specific provision in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK> or in any Malaysian legislation that stipulates the relevant standard of proof required in both criminal and civil proceedings. Thus, the principles of law in relation to the burden of proof and standard of proof in Malaysia are common law principles. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b>Under English law, the standard of proof for fraud in a civil claim is on the balance of probabilities. <i>In re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) (CAFCASS intervening) (folld)</i>. (paras 35, 37 &amp; 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The position of the law on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims in Malaysia is far from satisfactory. There was merit in the defendant's submission that the adoption of the criminal standard of proof for fraud in civil claims was due to the misinterpretation or a blind adoption of the judgment of Lord Atkin in <i>Narayanan Chettyar v. Official Assignee of the High Court, Rangoon</i>. (para 47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The correct principle to apply in Malaysia is as explained in <i>In re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) (CAFCASS intervening)</i>. At law there are only two standards of proof, namely, beyond reasonable doubt for criminal cases while it is on the balance of probabilities for civil cases. As such, even if fraud is the subject in a civil claim the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. There is no third standard. And neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. <i>In re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) (CAFCASS intervening) (folld)</i>. (para 49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> To restate the general rule at common law: "in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, proof in civil proceedings of facts amounting to the commission of a crime need only be on a balance of probabilities". <i>Boonsoom Boonyanit v. Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd (refd); Ang Hiok Seng v. Yim Yut Kiu (overd)</i>; <i>Lee You Sin v. Chong Ngo Khoon (overd)</i>; <i>Yong Tim v. Hoo Kok Chong &amp; Anor (overd)</i>. (paras 52-53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> Relating to the instant appeal, applying the principle on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims this court would agree with the Court of Appeal's decision to allow the defendant's counterclaim. (para 56)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The position of the law on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims in Malaysia is far from satisfactory.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Richard Malanjum CJSS:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This court granted the appellant leave to appeal on 10 October 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> There is only one leave question to consider which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the outset we note that the leave question uses the term 'burden of proof in civil fraud'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> There is of course a difference between the terms 'burden of proof' and 'standard of proof'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Briefly the former relates to the burden or obligation of proving a fact on the party who exerts the existence of any fact in issue and wishes the court to believe in its existence - <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;102.;;">ss 102</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;103.;;">103 of the Evidence Act 1950 ('the Act')</LINK>. The burden of proof of a party never shifts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The latter refers to 'the degree of persuasion which the tribunal must feel before it decides that the fact in issue did happen'. <i>(In re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) (CAFCASS intervening)</i>.<sup><a name="u1" href="#b1">1</a></sup></p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> With respect, after hearing the submissions of learned counsel for the parties we are of the view that the real issue for determination is on the standard of proof required in civil claim when fraud is alleged. Accordingly we will take that the use of the term 'burden of proof' in the leave question is meant to be the 'standard of proof'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Now, before we dwell into the leave question we need to first consider the facts involved in this appeal. This is necessary so that irrespective of our answer to the leave question we would at the same time be able to determine the final outcome of this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Further, in this judgment the appellant will be referred to as the plaintiff and the respondent as the defendant unless the context otherwise requires.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In early 2005, the defendant, Damai Setia Sdn Bhd was awarded a contract by Public Works Department ('PWD') to upgrade Federal Road A13 into a four-lanes road from Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah Junction to Tanjung Rambutan in the State of Perak ('the project'). On 1 February 2005 the defendant appointed a company VN Sunrise ('Sunrise') as their sub-contractor for the project. The work on the project commenced on 1 February 2005. It was duly completed on 15 October 2005. There was a two months delay in the completion. Concurrently the defendant appointed the plaintiff, Sinnaiyah &amp; Sons Sdn Bhd as the Project Manager for the project. As the Project Manager the plaintiff was to manage the accounts for the project and to make payments to subcontractors for the project including Sunrise for goods and materials supplied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In order to receive payments from PWD for the project and to facilitate the arrangement with the plaintiff, the defendant opened a current bank account with Bank Bumiputera Commerce in Johore Bahru. The plaintiff pre-signed all cheques and authorised the defendant to make the necessary payments from time to time from the said bank account. It was also agreed between the defendant and the plaintiff that the latter would be paid management fees for the services rendered for the duration of the project period (ie 1 February 2005 until 15 October 2005).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Unfortunately, the arrangement between the defendant and the plaintiff did not go smoothly. Dispute arose. The plaintiff sued the defendant for the sum of RM301,767.40 which it claimed to be the unpaid management fees and financial advances given.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In turn the defendant not only disputed the claim but also counterclaimed for the sum of RM535,836.04, being an amount the defendant alleged the plaintiff to have fraudulently paid itself instead of paying Sunrise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In defence to the counterclaim the plaintiff asserted that the sums it paid itself was for set-offs or contra payments for goods and materials supplied to Sunrise for the completion of the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> After hearing the evidence the learned trial judge dismissed both the claim of the plaintiff and the counterclaim of the defendant. It was the finding of the learned trial judge that the plaintiff had been duly paid for the management fees, that any financial advances made would be on illegal money lending and that the defendant failed to prove its counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal. In coming to its decision the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had failed to prove its claim for financial advances to the defendant. The defendant did not sign the payment vouchers for the alleged financial advances and with the project almost completed there was also no necessity for the alleged financial advances. As to the claim for management fees the Court of Appeal held that it was in fact a claim for interests. The project was already completed. Management was no longer required.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In respect of the counterclaim of the defendant the Court of Appeal held that the finding of the High Court was against the weight of the evidence adduced. The plaintiff was not authorised to pay itself but to Sunrise. The set-offs and contra payments as alleged by the plaintiff were unfounded as the defendant was still indebted to Sunrise. The appeal of the defendant was therefore allowed.</p>
    <p>

      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We begin with our observation that there is no specific provision in the Act or for that matter any legislation in Malaysia that stipulates the relevant standard of proof required in both criminal and civil proceedings. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;3.;;">Section 3 of the Act</LINK> in interpreting the words 'proved' and 'disproved' only makes reference to a 'prudent man'. As such the principles of law in relation to burden of proof and standard of proof are therefore common law principles. (See: <i>Public Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj</i><sup><a name="u4" href="#b4">4</a></sup>, <i>Bater v. Bater</i><sup><a name="u5" href="#b5">5</a></sup> and <i>Miller v. Minister of Pensions</i><sup><a name="u6" href="#b6">6</a></sup>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On casual perusal of the reported judgments by the courts in this country it can be elicited that there are at least three principles propounded in addressing the issue of what is the standard of proof required in civil claims when fraud is the subject matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The first principle is premised on the standard of beyond reasonable doubt as applied in criminal cases. Such principle began in the case of <i>Saminathan v. Pappa</i><sup><a name="u7" href="#b7">7</a></sup> in which the Privy Council upheld the decision of the then Federal Court that adopted the principle enunciated in <i>Narayanan (supra)</i>. Lord Atkin in that case said this at p 95:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> After <i>Saminathan (supra)</i> most of the subsequent decisions by the courts in Malaysia followed this first principle. (See: <i>Chu Choon Moi v. Ngan Sew Tin</i><sup><a name="u8" href="#b8">8</a></sup> and <i>Datuk Jagindar Singh &amp; Ors v. Tara Rajaratnam</i><sup><a name="u9" href="#b9">9</a></sup>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> But it would be quite erroneous to say that prior to <i>Saminathan (supra)</i>the courts in this country had also applied the first principle as enunciated. On the contrary before <i>Saminathan (supra)</i> the courts in this country applied albeit 'a very high degree of' the balance of probability standard in civil claims when fraud was alleged. In the case of <i>Lau Kee Ko &amp; Anor v. Paw Ngi Siu</i><sup><a name="u10" href="#b10">10</a></sup>, Raja Azlan Shah J (as His Majesty then was) delivering judgment for the then Federal Court said this at p 607:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(See also the earlier case of <i>Ratna Ammal v. Tan Chow Soo</i><sup><a name="u11" href="#b11">11</a></sup>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Meanwhile we take note that this court in <i>Ang Hiok Seng (supra)</i> declared that 'to the extent that the general statement of the law in <i>Lau Kee Ko (supra)</i> is understood to mean a total rejection of the criminal burden in all cases of fraud, it is no longer good law.' Whether this pronouncement is tenable today depends on our answer to the leave question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Anyway, even after <i>Saminathan (supra)</i> the then Federal Court appeared to have reverted to the earlier position.In the case of <i>Lee You Sin v. Chong Ngo Khoon<sup><a name="u12" href="#b12">12</a></sup></i>, the civil standard of proof for civil claims, that is, on the balance of probabilities was adopted despite the allegation of fraud. However, the court imposed the requirement of a higher degree of probability for a serious allegation of fraud. We take it as the second principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In delivering the judgment of the court Lee Hun Hoe CJ (Borneo) after making reference to <i>Bater v. Bater (supra)</i> said this at pp 253-254:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The foregoing view expressed in <i>Lee You Sin (supra)</i> was <i>in tandem</i> with what Winslow J said in the Singapore case of <i>Eastern Enterprises Ltd v. Ong Choo Kim</i><sup><a name="u13" href="#b13">13</a></sup>. He said this at p 366:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In other words, both the cases of <i>Eastern Enterprises (supra)</i> and <i>Lee You Sin (supra)</i> applied the balance of probabilities standard when fraud was alleged subject to the requirement of a higher degree of probability depending on the seriousness of the allegation. The more serious it is such as tilting towards criminal liability the higher degree of probability is required before it can be said that the standard of proof on the balance of probabilities has been satisfied.<sup><a name="u14" href="#b14">14</a></sup></p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> But while the two earlier conflicting principles<sup><a name="u15" href="#b15">15</a></sup> adopted by the highest court of this country were yet to be reconciled, this court in the case of <i>Ang Hiok Seng v. Yim Yut Kiu (supra)</i>crafted the third principle. It was held that the standard of proving fraud should be dependent on the nature of the fraud alleged. In delivering the judgment for the court Mohd Azmi FCJ said this at p 139:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b>We would say that the <i>Ang case (supra)</i> seemed to have made a distinction between civil fraud and criminal fraud even in civil proceedings. Examples of fraud with criminal nature in civil claims were given such as conspiracy to defraud or misappropriation of money or criminal breach of trust while for fraud of civil nature were those provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;17.;;">ss 17</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;18.;;">18 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. Those sections define certain acts as 'fraud' and 'misrepresentation' if they have induced the entering or deceived someone into entering a contract. Unfortunately even with such illustrations the demarcation between civil and criminal fraud remained ambiguous.<sup><a name="u16" href="#b16">16</a></sup></p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The confusion was further compounded when this court quite recently in the case of <i>Yong Tim v. Hoo Kok Chong &amp; Anor</i><sup><a name="u17" href="#b17">17</a></sup> was emphatic and adopted the first principle, namely, that 'the standard of proof for fraud in civil proceedings is one of beyond reasonable doubt which has been consistently applied by the courts in Malaysia. We see no reason to disturb that trend.' (See also: <i>Asean Security Paper Mills Sdn Bhd v. CGU Insurance Bhd</i><sup><a name="u18" href="#b18">18</a></sup>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It is therefore not surprising that subsequent to <i>Yong Tim (supra)</i> the lower courts, being bound by the principle of stare decisis, adopted the criminal standard of proof for fraud in civil claims. (See: <i>Chong Song v. Uma Devi V Kandiah</i><sup><a name="u19" href="#b19">19</a></sup> and <i>Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd v. Tan Bee Leh &amp; Ors</i>.<sup><a name="u20" href="#b20">20</a></sup></p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In view of such uncertainty in the law both learned counsel for the parties in this appeal strenuously urged us to revisit the earlier decisions of the courts in this country. It was submitted that the position of the law should be rectified so as to be in tandem with the generally accepted standard as applied in other common law jurisdictions, in particular among the Commonwealth countries such as England, Canada, Australia and Singapore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Now, before we respond to that urging it is only appropriate that we begin by examining the English position. Based on the various decisions of the English courts it is clear that under English law the standard of proof for fraud in civil claim has been on the balance of probabilities. But 'the elements of gravity of an issue are part of the range of circumstances which have to be weighed when deciding as to the balance of probabilities'.<sup><a name="u21" href="#b21">21</a></sup></p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> While the English position appeared to be clear, some confusion came about when the Privy Council through Lord Atkin held otherwise<sup><a name="u22" href="#b22">22</a></sup> and failed to consider an earlier decision of the same tribunal.<sup><a name="u23" href="#b23">23</a></sup> This resulted in some common law jurisdictions including this country adopting the criminal standard of proof on a beyond reasonable doubt in civil claims when fraud is alleged. But there were also some other jurisdictions, after considering the rationale of the proposition by Lord Atkin, declined to follow it.<sup><a name="u24" href="#b24">24</a></sup></p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Be that as it may, the English position is now settled once and for all in the case of <i>In re B (Children) (supra).<sup><a name="u25" href="#b25">25</a></sup></i> In that case the House of Lords held that there is 'only one civil standard of proof and that is proof that the fact in issue more probably occurred than not'. The 'range of circumstances which have to be weighed when deciding as to the balance of probabilities'<sup><a name="u26" href="#b26">26</a></sup> or 'heightened civil standard'<sup><a name="u27" href="#b27">27</a></sup> is no longer a factor to consider 'when deciding as to the balance of probabilities'. This is what Lord Hoffmann said at p 7:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> And Baroness Hale of Richmond was even more forceful in emphasising on the law when she said this at p 11 and p 22 respectively:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It is worthy to note that the English Supreme Court in the case of <i>In re S-B Children</i><sup><a name="u28" href="#b28">28</a></sup> followed the law as pronounced in <i>In re B (Children) (supra)</i>. The Supreme Court firmly approved that 'there is only one civil standard of proof and that is proof that the fact in issue more probably occurred than not'. The court also rejected the "nostrum, 'the more serious the allegation, the more cogent the evidence needed to prove it"'. This rejection goes to show that even for hybrid cases<sup><a name="u29" href="#b29">29</a></sup> the same civil standard of proof applies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The Canadian courts took the same position as the English courts. In <i>FH v. McDougall</i><sup><a name="u30" href="#b30">30</a></sup>the Canadian Supreme Court held that 'in civil cases there is only one standard of proof and that is proof on a balance of probabilities. In all civil cases, the trial judge must scrutinise the relevant evidence with care to determine whether it is more likely than not that an alleged event occurred.'</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> And in rejecting the suggestion that there are different levels of scrutiny of evidence depending on the seriousness of the allegation, Rothstein J in delivering the judgment of the Canadian Supreme Court said this at para 45:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In fact long before <i>McDougall (supra)</i> the position of the law in Canada<sup><a name="u31" href="#b32">32</a></sup> was in line with the jurisprudence as stated in<i>Bater v. Bater (supra)</i></p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In Australia the approach then by the courts there could be surmised in the case of <i>Rejfek &amp; Anor v. McElroy &amp; Anor</i><sup><a name="u32" href="#b32">32</a></sup> in which the High Court of Australia stated this at para 11:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> It is to be noted that <i>Rejfek &amp; Anor v. McElroy &amp; Anor (supra)</i> followed an earlier decision of the High Court in <i>Helton v. Allen</i><sup><a name="u33" href="#b33">33</a></sup> that preferred the decision in <i>Doe d Devine v. Wilson (supra)</i> to that of Lord Atkin's pronouncements in <i>New York v. Heirs of Phillips Dec'd (supra)</i> and <i>Narayanan (supra)</i>. Indeed the pronouncements of Lord Atkin were considered as a <i>mere dicta</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Nearer home, in Singapore, the principle of law on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims is also on the balance of probabilities. And although the notion of a third standard of proof where fraud is the subject in a civil claim has been rejected, the courts there nevertheless added a caution that 'the more serious the allegation, the more the party, on whose shoulders the burden of proof falls, may have to do if he hopes to establish his case'.<sup><a name="u34" href="#b34">34</a></sup></p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> It is therefore quite obvious that the current law in Singapore on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims is the pre <i>In re B (Children) (supra)</i> position under the English law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In view of the positions of the law in the respective common law jurisdictions as summarised above, we agree with both learned counsel for the parties in this appeal that the position of the law on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims in this country is far from satisfactory. With respect, there is merit in the submission of learned counsel for the defendant that the adoption of the criminal standard of proof for fraud in civil claims is due to the misinterpretation or even a blind adoption of the judgment of Lord Atkin in <i>Narayanan Chettyar v. Official Assignee of the High Court, Rangoon (supra).</i></p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> As such, in our judgment the time has come to realign the position of the law in this country on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims. While learned counsel for the defendant seemed to favour the adoption of the Singapore position, learned counsel for the plaintiff urged us to adopt the principle in <i>In re B (Children) (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> With respect, we are inclined to agree with learned counsel for the plaintiff that the correct principle to apply is as explained in <i>In re B (Children) (supra)</i>. It is this: that at law there are only two standards of proof, namely, beyond reasonable doubt for criminal cases while it is on the balance of probabilities for civil cases. As such even if fraud is the subject in a civil claim the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. There is no third standard. And '(N)either the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts.'</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Hence, it is therefore up to the presiding judge, after hearing and considering the evidence adduced as being done in any other civil claim to find whether the standard of proof has been attained. 'The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies.' The criminal aspect of the allegation of fraud and the standard of proof required thereof should be irrelevant in the deliberation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Accordingly as stated earlier we agree with the reasons given by learned counsel for both parties that the present standard of proof for fraud in a civil claim in this country is not in line with the principle as applied in other common law jurisdictions and should therefore be reviewed.<sup><a name="u35" href="#b35">35</a></sup> Indeed it is quite obvious in <i>Narayanan (supra)</i> that Lord Akin did not provide any cogent reason for applying the criminal standard of proof in a civil claim when fraud is alleged. Similarly in <i>Saminathan (supra)</i> the principle in <i>Narayanan (supra)</i> was applied without any discussion on its rationale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We therefore reiterate that we agree and accept the rationale in <i>In re B (Children) (supra)</i> that in a civil claim even when fraud is alleged the civil standard of proof, that is, on the balance of probabilities, should apply. And perhaps it is not out of place here to restate the general rule at common law that, "in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, proof in civil proceedings of facts amounting to the commission of a crime need only be on a balance of probabilities". (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_209;"><i>Boonsoom Boonyanit v. Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 209</LINK>; [1997] 2 MLJ 62; [1997] 3 CLJ 17, at p 216).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Accordingly, despite the reaffirmation of the law on the issue in <i>Yong Tim v. Hoo Kok Cheong (supra)</i> we hold that it is no longer the law in this country. Similarly, the principles as pronounced in <i>Ang Hiok Seng (supra)</i> and <i>Lee You Sin v. Chong Ngo Khoon (supra)</i> despite applying the civil standard to a certain extent are also no longer the law. Hence, the disapproval of <i>Lau Kee Ko (supra)</i> in <i>Ang Hiok Seng (supra)</i> is no longer relevant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> However, we should make it clear that this judgment only applies to this appeal and to future cases and should not be utilised to set aside or review past decisions involving fraud in civil claims.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Our answer to the leave question is therefore in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Reverting to the present appeal, we have duly perused the facts and evidence adduced. And applying the principle we have just pronounced on the standard of proof for fraud in civil claims which is less onerous than the standard applied by the courts below, we agree with the reasons, findings and conclusions of the Court of Appeal in allowing the counterclaim of the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> In the upshot this appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</p>
