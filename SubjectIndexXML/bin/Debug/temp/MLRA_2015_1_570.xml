    <p>This was an appeal by three appellants against the dismissal of their judicial review application by the High Court for a declaration that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66 of the Syariah Criminal (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 1992 ('s 66')</LINK> was void by reason of being inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution ('Constitution')</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> was a State enacted Islamic law made pursuant to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">List II (State List) Item 1 of the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> prohibited male persons in public places from wearing women's attire or posing as women. Any male person caught doing so was guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both. The three appellants were Muslim men having a medical condition called Gender Identity Disorder ('GID'). Due to that condition, the appellants had been expressing themselves as women and showing the mannerisms of the feminine gender such as wearing women's clothes and make-up. The appellants were repeatedly detained, arrested, and prosecuted by the religious authority of Negeri Sembilan acting pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> for cross-dressing and that led to their application for judicial review. The opinion of the learned Mufti of the State of Negeri Sembilan was tendered to show that the prohibition of a male Muslim dressing or posing as a woman prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was a precept of Islam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The evidence furnished by the appellants established that GID was an attribute of the appellants' nature that they did not choose and could not change, and that much harm would be caused to them should they be punished for merely exhibiting a manifestation of GID, ie cross-dressing. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">Article 74(2) of the Constitution</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">List II (State List) Item 1 of the Ninth Schedule</LINK> empowered State legislatures to legislate on matters pertaining to the religion of Islam. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> came under the following sub-item of Item 1 of the State List that read "... creation and punishment of offences by persons professing the religion of Islam against precepts of that religion." However, the exercise of that legislative power was not without constitutional limitations. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">Article 74(3)</LINK> stipulated that the legislative powers of the States were exercisable subject to any conditions or restrictions imposed with respect to any particular matter by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Constitution</LINK>. (paras 23-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The religion of Islam was declared by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(1) of the Constitution</LINK> to be the religion of the Federation. It was the intention of the framers of the Constitution that the word "Islam" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(1)</LINK> be given a restrictive meaning (Supreme Court in <i>Che Omar Che Soh v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i>). <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">Article 3(4)</LINK> qualified the status of Islam in that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(1)</LINK> was subject to, amongst others, the fundamental liberties provisions as enshrined in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Part II of the Constitution</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">Article 4(1)</LINK> declared that the Constitution was the supreme law of the Federation and any law passed which was inconsistent with the Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void. <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Part II of the Constitution</LINK> guaranteed the fundamental liberties of all Malaysians. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">Articles 74(3)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">4(1) of the Constitution</LINK> read together clearly stated that all State laws including Islamic laws passed by State legislatures must be consistent with Part II of the Constitution. (paras 26-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The question of whether or not <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was consistent with the precepts of Islam was not an issue in the present case. The Mufti's opinion failed to address the issue that was crucial for the purpose of the present constitutional challenge on the position in Islam as to the appropriate dress code for male Muslims who were sufferers of GID like the appellants. (paras 35-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">Article 5(1) of the Constitution</LINK> guaranteed that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty save in accordance with law. The word 'life' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(1)</LINK> included the right to live with dignity. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> prohibited the appellants from cross-dressing, and punished them for any breach of the prohibition. As long as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was in force the appellants would continue to live in uncertainty, misery and indignity. They came to court hoping that they might be able to live with dignity and be treated as equal citizens of this nation. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> deprived the appellants of their right to live with dignity. Furthermore, the word 'life' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(1)</LINK> meant more than a mere animal existence. It also included such rights as livelihood and the quality of life. The effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was that it prohibited the appellants who cross-dressed from moving in public places to reach their respective places of work. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> was therefore inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(1)</LINK> and void. (paras 40, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50 &amp; 51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">Article 8(1) of the Constitution</LINK> guaranteed equality before the law and equal protection of the law. The object of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was to prohibit all male Muslims from cross-dressing or appearing as women in public places. The appellants were male Muslims suffering from GID, where the desire to dress as females and to be recognised as females was part of the said medical condition. There was no scientifically proven pharmacological treatment or psychological therapy for such medical condition. (para 53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The appellants as male Muslims suffering from GID were in a different situation as compared to normal male Muslims. They were not under like circumstances and were not equals as normal male Muslims. Being not equal, the appellants should not be treated similarly as normal male Muslims. Yet <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> provided for equal treatment. It did not provide for any exception for sufferers of GID like the appellants. The State, although not disputing the existence of sufferers of GID among male Muslims, did not explain for such a serious legislative omission. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> simply ignored GID sufferers and unfairly subjected them to the enforcement of the law. As a consequence, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> placed the GID sufferers in an untenable and horrible situation. They could not dress in public in the way that was natural to them. They would commit the crime of offending <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> the very moment they left their homes to attend to the basic needs of life, to earn a living or to socialise, and be liable to arrest, detention and prosecution. The inclusion of persons suffering from GID in the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> prohibition discriminated against them. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> denied the appellants the equal protection of the law. It was therefore inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8(1) of the Constitution</LINK> and void. (paras 54-56)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">Article 8(2) of the Constitution</LINK> provided that in any law there shall be no discrimination against citizens on the ground of gender. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> prohibited male Muslims from cross-dressing or from posing as women in public but did not prohibit female Muslims from cross-dressing as men or from posing as men in public. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> was therefore discriminatory on the ground of gender and was inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8(2)</LINK> and void. (paras 57-59)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> was not "personal law" for the purpose of cl (5)(a) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK> contrary to the argument of the State Legal Adviser. Clause (5)(a) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8</LINK> permitted the making of personal laws that discriminated on account of gender or other factors that were enumerated in cl (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> was not enacted pursuant to the particular sub-item that referred to personal law. It was enacted pursuant to the particular sub-item that read "... creation and punishment of offences by persons professing the religion of Islam against precepts of that religion." (paras 60-62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">Article 9(2) of the Constitution</LINK> guaranteed freedom of movement within the Federation. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> did not merely restrict the appellants' freedom of movement but denied the appellants of the right to move freely in public places. In effect, the appellants would not be able to leave their homes and move freely in the State of Negeri Sembilan without being exposed to being arrested and punished under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> denied the appellants their right to freedom of movement. Even if <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was a restriction and not a denial of the right to freedom of movement, such restriction according to judicial authorities (<i>Sivarasa Rasiah v. Badan Peguam Malaysia &amp; Anor</i>; <i>Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim v. Menteri Dalam Negeri Malaysia, Muhammad Hilman Idham &amp; Ors v. Kerajaan Malaysia &amp; Ors</i>) must be subject to the test of reasonableness. However, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was an unreasonable restriction and hence unconstitutional as being inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">art 9(2) of the Constitution</LINK>. (paras 64-68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">Article 10(1)(a) of the Constitution</LINK> guaranteed freedom of expression. A person's dress, attire or articles of clothing were a form of expression guaranteed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a)</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> directly affected the appellants' right to freedom of expression, in that they were prohibited from wearing the attire and articles of clothing of their choice. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">Article 10(2)(a)</LINK> stated that only Parliament might restrict freedom of expression in limited situations as long as such restrictions were reasonable. The State legislative assemblies in Malaysia including the State Legislature of Negeri Sembilan had no power to restrict freedom of speech and expression. Only Parliament had such power (Supreme Court in <i>Dewan Undangan Negeri Kelantan &amp; Anor v. Nordin Salleh &amp; Anor (1)</i>). <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> was a State law that criminalised any male Muslim wearing a woman's attire or posing as a woman in a public place. Hence, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was unconstitutional since it purported to restrict freedom of speech and expression. Moreover, the restriction was unreasonable. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> was therefore inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a)</LINK> and void. (paras 69-78)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> There was no merit in the submission of the State Legal Advisor that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was not prejudicial to the appellants as they were persons of unsound mind and hence entitled to the defence accorded by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;11.;;">s 11 of the Syariah Criminal Enactment 1992 (Negeri Sembilan)</LINK>, the wordings of which were similar to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Penal Code</LINK>. In the absence of medical evidence it was improper to suggest that the appellants and other transgenders were persons of unsound mind. (paras 91-93)</p>

      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal is against the decision of the High Court of Seremban of 11 October 2012 that had dismissed the appellants' application for judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The application for judicial review is for a declaration that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66 of the Syariah Criminal Enactment 1992 (Negeri Sembilan) ("s 66")</LINK> is void by reason of being inconsistent with the following articles of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The High Court of Seremban had dismissed the judicial review application; hence, the present appeal to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The three appellants are Muslim men. Medically, however, they are not normal males. This is because they have a medical condition called 'Gender Identity Disorder' ('GID'). Because of this medical condition, since a young age the appellants have been expressing themselves as women and showing the mannerisms of the feminine gender such as wearing women's clothes and using makeups. Indeed, they feel natural being such.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> That the appellants are sufferers of GID is confirmed by a psychiatrist from the Kuala Lumpur Hospital; as well as by a psychologist. The evidence of these experts remains unrebutted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In 1992 the legislature of the State of Negeri Sembilan enacted the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;;">Syariah Criminal Enactment 1992 (Negeri Sembilan)</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66 of this Enactment</LINK> makes it an offence for any Muslim male person to do any of the following in a public place: to wear a woman's attire, or to pose as a woman. Those convicted can be liable to a fine not exceeding RM1,000.00 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. This section makes no exception for sufferers of GID like the appellants. No explanation has been given by the State for this unfortunate omission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Hence, as a consequence, the appellants have been repeatedly detained, arrested, and prosecuted by the religious authority of Negeri Sembilan acting pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> for cross-dressing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The injustice and humiliation that they are subject to moved them to apply to the court for this declaration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Their application involves the interpretation of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>; and we pause for a moment here to reiterate that only the Superior Civil Courts established under Part IX (The Judiciary) of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> have the jurisdiction to determine disputes on the interpretation of the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_847;"><i>Latifah Mat Zin v. Rosmawati Sharibun &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 847</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 101; [2007] 5 CLJ 253; [2006] 4 AMR 591 (the panel comprising Abdul Hamid Mohamad FCJ (as he then was), Arifin Zakaria FCJ (as he then was) and Augustine Paul FCJ) the Federal Court reminds us (at para [76]):</p>

      <b>[10]</b> Leave to apply for judicial review was granted on 4 November 2011 by Rosnaini Saub J, but the substantive judicial review application was heard by another judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Gender Identity Disorder: Medical Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Diagnosis Of The Appellants By Psychiatrist Dr Ang Jin Kiat</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellants had been medically examined by one Dr Ang Jin Kiat, a psychiatrist from the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, a Government hospital.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Dr Ang's medical reports confirm that the appellants suffer from a medical condition known as 'Gender Identity Disorder' ('GID'). According to Dr Ang's reports, the 'desire to dress as a female and to be recognised as a female is in keeping with this condition' and there is no 'scientifically proven pharmacological treatment or psychological therapy'. In other words, cross-dressing is intrinsic to the appellants' nature; and that this abnormal condition is incurable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Dr Ang Jin Kiat's medical reports are unrebutted by the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Consultant Psychiatrist's Opinion, By Dr Deva Dass</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Dr Deva Dass, a Consultant Psychiatrist, by an affidavit, provides further opinion on GID. Dr Deva Dass states that GID is also referred to as 'Transsexualism', and those who suffer from it are called 'Transsexuals'. He states that GID is not a preference and is ineradicable, and that wearing clothing of the opposite sex occurs among sufferers of GID.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Dr Deva Dass' affidavit also exhibits excerpts from a medical authority, namely, the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>, Fourth Edition (DSM IV-TR), published by the American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC. These excerpts explain the diagnostic features of GID. Gender Identity Disorders are characterised by strong and persistent cross-gender identification accompanied by persistent discomfort with one's assigned sex.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The following excerpts are illustrative:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> According to Dr Dass:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Clinical Psychologist's Report</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Besides the two psychiatrists' evidence/reports above, the appellants have also tendered a report by one Ms Vizla Kumaresan; a Clinical Psychologist.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The report confirms that the appellants psychologically identify themselves as women.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Likewise, Ms Kumaresan's psychological reports, exhibited in the respective affidavits of the appellants, have not been rebutted by the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Sociologist's Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In further support of the appellants' case, affidavits are also filed by one Professor Teh Yik Koon, a renowned Malaysian sociologist, explaining that a law like <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> has adverse effects on transsexuals and on Malaysian society. In the expert opinion of the learned Professor:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>What The Appellants' Evidence Established</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The evidence furnished by the appellants, therefore, establish that GID is an attribute of the appellants' nature that they did not choose and cannot change; and that much harm would be caused to them should they be punished for merely exhibiting a manifestation of GID, ie cross-dressing.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The meaning of 'Islam' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(1)</LINK> is explained by the Supreme Court in (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1988_1_657;"><i>Che Omar Che Soh v.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In short, the Supreme Court takes the position that it was the intention of the framers of our <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> that the word 'Islam' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(1)</LINK> be given a restrictive meaning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> But what is more important for the purpose of our judgment is the fact that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;3.;;">art 3(4)</LINK> qualifies the status of Islam in following terms:</p>

      <b>Mufti's Opinion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The State in response to the appellants' constitutional challenge, have filed an affidavit by the learned Mufti of the State of Negeri Sembilan. In his affidavit the learned Mufti opines that the prohibition of a male Muslim dressing or posing as a woman is a precept of Islam ('the Mufti's Opinion').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The Mufti's Opinion is tendered to explain that the offence prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is in accordance with the precepts of Islam.</p>

      <b>[38]</b> We wish to make it clear here that whether or not <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is consistent with the precepts of Islam is not in issue in the present case. Indeed, this is conceded by Mr Aston Paiva, the learned counsel for the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> But Mr Paiva makes a pertinent point, and that is that, the Mufti's Opinion, remarkably, fails to address the issue that is crucial for the purpose of the present constitutional challenge: what is the position in Islam as to the appropriate dress code for male Muslims who are sufferers of GID, like the appellants?</p>

    <p>
      <b>[44]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> prohibits the appellants and all other male Muslim sufferers of GID from cross-dressing, and punishes them for any breach of the prohibition. The learned counsel for the appellants argues that the profound effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is that the appellants and other GID sufferers are perpetually at risk of arrest and prosecution simply because they express themselves in a way which is part of their experience of being human. The very core identity of the appellants is criminalised solely on account of their gender identity. The learned counsel submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is irreconcilable with the existence of the appellants and all other GID sufferers. A more disturbing effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is that it builds insecurity and vulnerability into the lives of the appellants and other Muslim male persons with GID. The existence of a law that punishes the gender expression of transsexuals, degrades and devalues persons with GID in our society. As such, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> directly affects the appellants' right to live with dignity, guaranteed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(1)</LINK>, by depriving them of their value and worth as members of our society.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> We find merit in this argument. As long as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is in force the appellants will continue to live in uncertainty, misery and indignity. They now come before this court in the hope that they may be able to live with dignity and be treated as equal citizens of this nation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We, therefore, hold that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">art 5(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> in that the section deprives the appellants of their right to live with dignity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Therefore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is unconstitutional and void.</p>

      <b>[53]</b> In the present appeal, the object of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is to prohibit all male Muslims from cross-dressing or appearing as a woman in a public place. But the appellants are male Muslims suffering from Gender Identity Disorder (GID), where the desire to dress as a female and to be recognised as a female is part of the said medical condition; and that there is no scientifically proven pharmacological treatment or psychological therapy for such medical condition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In this appeal, we accept the appellants' argument that they, as male Muslims suffering from GID, are in a different situation as compared to normal male Muslims. They and the normal male Muslims are not under like circumstances and are thus unequals. Being unequals, the appellants should not be treated similarly as the normal male Muslims. Yet <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> provides for equal treatment. It does not provide for any exception for sufferers of GID like the appellants. The State, although does not dispute the existence of sufferers of GID among male Muslims such as the appellants, yet does not explain for such a serious legislative omission. In other words, the State and the impugned section simply ignore GID sufferers such as the appellants, and unfairly subject them to the enforcement of the law. As a consequence, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> places the GID sufferers in an untenable and horrible situation. They could not dress in public in the way that is natural to them. They will commit the crime of offending <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> the very moment they leave their homes to attend to the basic needs of life, to earn a living, or to socialise; and be liable to arrest, detention and prosecution. This is degrading, oppressive and inhuman. Thus the inclusion of persons suffering from GID in the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> prohibition discriminates against them. Therefore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> as it is discriminatory and oppressive, and denies the appellants the equal protection of the law.</p>

      <b>[68]</b> However, even if we were to regard <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> as a restriction and not as a denial of the right to move freely within the country, still, such restriction, according to judicial authorities (see <i>Sivarasa Rasiah</i>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_396;"><i>Dr Mohd Nasir Hashim v.

      <b>[73]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> directly affects the appellants' right to freedom of expression, in that they are prohibited from wearing the attire and articles of clothing of their choice.</p>

On 15 April 2014, the Indian Supreme Court in <i>National Legal Services Authority v.

The Supreme Court considers the nature of 'gender identity' as being 'a person's intrinsic sense of being male, female or transgender or transsexual person' (at para [19] of the judgment). The court explores a myriad of international human rights conventions and norms (at paras [21]-[24] of the judgment), case laws on transsexuals, and legislation in other countries on transgenders (at paras [35]- [42] of the judgment) and ruled as follows:</p>

The present case has absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality. As what we have said earlier, this case is about male Muslim persons with a medical condition called Gender Identity Disorder (GID).
