    <p>The appellant obtained an arbitration award against the respondent on 4 January 2000 and obtained a High Court order on 19 January 2004 to register the same as a High Court judgment under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the Arbitration Act 1952 ('AA 1952')</LINK>. On 14 March 2012, leave was granted by the High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> for the appellant to enforce the judgment, after which, the appellant as judgment creditor commenced bankruptcy proceedings against the respondent. The respondent then applied to set aside the bankruptcy proceedings on the ground that the proceedings were commenced after six years from the date of the award of 4 January 2000 and, therefore, barred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1953 ('Act')</LINK>. The High Court dismissed the application. The Court of Appeal, however, allowed the application on appeal by the respondent. The Court of Appeal relied on the English Court of Appeal decision of National Ability SA v. Tinna Oils and Chemicals Ltd, The Amazon Reefer ('Amazon Reefer') in coming to its decision. The appellant now appealed before the Federal Court. The main issue was whether the enforcement of an arbitration award must be within the six-year limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Act</LINK> or the 12-year limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal fell into error in finding that the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were time-barred by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Act</LINK>. The Court of Appeal's reliance on the case of Amazon Reefer was misplaced. That case dealt with an application for registration of an arbitration award as a judgment of the court and the statutory limitation period relating to the same. The facts therein were straightforward in that the application to enforce the arbitration award was made well after the limitation period. The arbitration award was made in 1998 and 1999 but the application to enforce the award was made on 14 July 2008, well after the six-year period. (para 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was no dispute in the present case that the application to register the award was made well before the expiration of the six-year period. The appellant obtained the award on 4 January 2000. The application to register the award for the purpose of enforcing it as a judgment of the court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the AA 1952</LINK> was made on 19 January 2004. This was well within the six-year limitation period spelt out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Act</LINK>. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The words "to enforce an award" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Act</LINK> did not apply to both the registration of an arbitration award and enforcement of an arbitration award. There was a clear distinction between "registration of an arbitration award" and "enforcement of a judgment" that arose from the arbitration award duly registered as a judgment of the court, which in the present case was the subject matter of the bankruptcy proceedings. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the AA 1952</LINK> and s <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">38(1) of the Arbitration Act 2005 ('AA 2005')</LINK> were simply procedural provisions enabling an award in consensual arbitration proceedings to be registered. In principle, unlike an order of the judgment of the court, an arbitration award did not immediately entitle a successful party to levy execution against the assets of the unsuccessful party. The arbitration award must first be converted into a judgment or order of the court before the successful party could levy execution. It was only upon converting the arbitration award that it would be considered as a judgment or order of the court. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Once the arbitration award was registered it would take effect as a judgment of the court. Emphasis was placed on the word "judgment" in both <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">ss 27 of the AA 1952</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">38(1) of the AA 2005</LINK>. Both provisions made a clear distinction between an award and a judgment. In the circumstances, the enforcement of arbitration awards must be viewed in two parts. First, the registration of the arbitration award itself as a judgment of the court and, secondly, the enforcement or execution of such a judgment. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> When parties sought to enforce an arbitration award, ie to register it under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the AA 1952</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38(1) of the AA 2005</LINK>, the limitation period of six years pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Act</LINK> applied. In the present case the award was issued on 4 January 2000 and was registered as the judgment of the court on 19 January 2004. That was well within the six-year limitation prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Act</LINK>. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The limitation period for enforcement, ie the execution of the judgment of the court, would be 12 years as prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Act</LINK>. Since the award in the present case was registered as the judgment of the court on 19 January 2004, the appellant would have 12 years from the date when the award became a judgment of court to enforce it. The leave application to enforce or execute the judgment on 14 March 2012 was filed well within the 12-year limitation period under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Act</LINK>. The High Court was therefore correct in finding that the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were not barred by limitation since it had commenced the action within 12 years from the date of the registration of the award as a judgment of the court. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The limitation period for the registration of an arbitration award as a judgment of the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;;">AA 1952</LINK> or <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;;">AA 2005</LINK> was six years pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Act</LINK> from the issuance of that award by an arbitration tribunal. As for the arbitration award registered as a judgment of the court, the limitation period was 12 years pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Act</LINK> to which the award might be enforced.

      <b>Raus Sharif PCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 27 January 2014, this court granted the appellant leave pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal. The leave granted was in respect of two questions namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 4 January 2000, the appellant obtained an arbitration award (Award) against the respondent. Thereafter on 19 January 2004, the appellant obtained an Order of the High Court to register the Award as the judgment of the court (judgment) for the purpose of enforcing the same under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the Arbitration Act 1952</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 14 March 2012, leave was granted by the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;46.;;">O 46 r 2 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> for the appellant to enforce the judgment after six years from the date of its registration. It is pertinent to note that the application for leave was opposed by the respondent. However, the respondent did not appeal against the order for leave granted by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Thereafter, the appellant as the judgment creditor, commenced bankruptcy proceedings against the respondent, the judgment debtor, based on the judgment dated 19 January 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At the High Court, the respondent applied to set aside the bankruptcy proceedings on the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned deputy registrar dismissed the respondent's application to set aside the bankruptcy proceedings. The said decision was affirmed by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> At the Court of Appeal, the respondent only proceeded on the issue of whether the bankruptcy proceedings were barred by limitation. After having heard the submissions, the Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Court of Appeal found that the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were time barred. The Court of Appeal was of the view that the registration or transformation of the award into the judgment was nothing but a mere procedure to enforce an award. In support of this view, the Court of Appeal relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in the case of <i>National Ability SA v. Tinna Oils and Chemicals Ltd, The Amazon Reefer</i> [2010] 2 All ER 257 (Amazon Reefer), where it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Thus, in the instant case the Court of Appeal was of the view that the date for calculation of the limitation period must then be 4 January 2000 and since the bankruptcy proceedings were filed on 4 April 2012, which was well after the six years limitation period as provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were invalid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The main issue before us was whether the six years limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> applies to the enforcement of an arbitration award or whether the 12 years limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the same Act</LINK> applies. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">Section 6(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">Section 6(3)</LINK> on the other hand provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The High Court in finding that the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were not time barred, had applied <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, whilst the Court of Appeal in finding that the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were in fact time barred, had applied <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the same Act</LINK>. As stated earlier the Court of Appeal in deciding as it did, relied on the English Court of Appeal decision in Amazon Reefer. Thus, it is necessary for us to examine carefully what was decided in that case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In Amazon Reefer, National Ability SA, a Panama company, were the owners of Amazon Reefer. They chartered her to Tinna Oils &amp; Chemicals Ltd, an Indian company, under a charter party on the Gencon form dated 29 April 1995 for a voyage from Kandla to Novorossiysk. The charter party provided for the resolution of disputes by arbitration in London under English Law. Disputes arose between National Ability SA and Tinna Oils &amp; Chemicals Ltd which were referred to arbitration in London.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> By awards dated 19 November 1998 and 12 October 1999, the arbitrators awarded the National Ability SA approximately USD820,000.00, interest until the date of the award, the costs of arbitration, and interest on the costs. Meanwhile in the course of the arbitration proceedings, Tinna Oils &amp; Chemicals Ltd, entered into a scheme of arrangement in India with Tinna Finex Ltd (TFL) under the Indian Companies Act 1956. There were proceedings between National Ability SA and Tinna Oils &amp; Chemicals Ltd and TFL in which the High Court in Delhi held on 4 June 2008 that the proper party with the obligation to make payments under the awards was TFL and it dismissed the claim to enforce against Tinna Oils &amp; Chemicals Ltd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Thereafter, on 14 July 2008, National Ability SA obtained an ex parte order before the High Court in England giving them permission under s 26 of the English Arbitration Act 1950 to enforce the arbitration awards as judgment against Tinna Oils &amp; Chemicals Ltd and to enter judgment in terms of the award. Tinna Oils &amp; Chemicals Ltd subsequently applied successfully to set the ex parte order aside. Later on at the<i>inter partes</i> hearing, the learned High Court Judge held that the application by National Ability SA failed because it was made after six years, thus contrary to s 7 of the English Limitation Act 1980. The English Court of Appeal held that that the limitation period of six years under s 7 of the English Limitation Act 1980 was applicable to an application to enforce an arbitration award in the same manner as a judgment under s 26(1) of the English Arbitration Act 1950.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Aggrieved with the said decision National Ability SA appealed to the English Court of Appeal contending that the limitation period of six years under s 7 of the English Limitation Act 1980 did not apply to an application under s 26 of the English Arbitration Act 1950. Learned counsel representing National Ability SA argued that the procedure under s 26 had to be viewed in two parts. It was first an application to obtain a judgment and then, once the judgment had been obtained, an application to enforce that judgment. Viewed in that sense there was no proceeding to enforce an award under s 26, but merely proceedings to obtain a judgment. Learned counsel further argued that by its terms s 7 of the English Limitation Act 1980 did not apply to proceedings to enforce a judgment. The provisions of s 24(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 were relevant to the enforcement of a judgment in that an action shall not be brought upon any judgment after the expiration of six years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable. Hence, it was National Ability SA's contention that the limitation period prescribed under s 7 of the English Limitation Act 1980 did not apply to proceedings to enforce a judgment under s 26 of the English Arbitration Act 1950.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The argument by National Ability SA was rejected by the English Court of Appeal. It was held that an application under s 26 of the English Arbitration Act 1950 was a proceeding in a court of law which was an 'action to enforce an award' within the meaning of s 7 of the English Limitation Act 1980. And s 7 provided for a six years limitation period. Since the application by National Ability SA to enforce the award was made after six years, the application was time barred by the English Limitation Act 1980.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Adverting to the specifics in relation to the instant case, with respect, we find that the Court of Appeal fell into error in finding that the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were time barred, by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>. The Court of Appeal's reliance on the case of Amazon Reefer is in our view not apt and somewhat misplaced. It is trite that each case must turn on its own facts and circumstances and the scope and nature of the legislation under scrutiny. That being said, we find that the case of Amazon Reefer was dealing with an application for registration of an arbitration award as a judgment of the court and the statutory limitation period relating to the same. We find that the facts in Amazon Reefer is straightforward in the sense that the application to enforce an arbitration award was made well after the limitation period. The arbitration award was made in 1998 and 1999, but the application to enforce them was made on 14 July 2008, which was well after the six years period.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In our instant case there is no dispute that the application to register the Award was made well before the expiration of the six years period. The appellant obtained the Award on 4 January 2000. The application to register the Award for the purpose of enforcing the same as a judgment of the court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the Arbitration Act 1952</LINK> was made on 19 January 2004. This was well within the limitation period spelt out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, ie, six years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The Court of Appeal construed the words "to enforce the award" to mean the execution of the judgment. It is our view that although the words "to enforce an award" is used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, we do not think it applies to both the registration of an arbitration award and enforcement of an arbitration award. In our considered view, there is a clear distinction between "registration of an arbitration award" and "enforcement of a judgment" that arises from the arbitration award that is duly registered as a judgment of the court, which in our present case is the subject matter of the bankruptcy proceedings. The provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the Arbitration Act 1952</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;;38.;;">s 38(1) of the Arbitration Act 2005</LINK> are simply procedural provisions enabling an award made in consensual arbitration proceedings to be registered. In principle, unlike an order or judgment of the court, an arbitration award does not immediately entitle a successful party to levy execution against the assets of the unsuccessful party. The arbitration award must first be converted into a judgment or order of the court before the successful party can levy execution. Only upon converting the arbitration award will it be considered as a judgment or order of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">Section 27 of the Arbitration Act 1952</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">Section 38(1) of the Arbitration Act 2005</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Thus, it is clear from the above that once the arbitration award is registered it will take effect as a judgment of the court. We have laid emphasis to the word "judgment" in both provisions. It is abundantly clear, both provisions refer to procedures before an arbitration award is registered and converted into a judgment of the court. Both provisions had made a clear distinction between an award and a judgment. Under the circumstances, the enforcement of arbitration awards must be viewed in two parts. First is the registration of the arbitration award itself as a judgment of the court, and secondly the enforcement or execution of such a judgment.</p>

      <b>[24]</b> It is clear to us that when parties sought to enforce an arbitration award, ie, to register it under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;27.;;">s 27 of the Arbitration Act 1952</LINK> or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;38.;;">s 38(1) of the Arbitration Act 2005</LINK> the limitation period of six years pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> applies. In the present case the Award was issued on 4 January 2000 and was registered as the judgment of the court on the 19 January 2004. This was well within the six years limitation prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(c) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> lt is also clear to us that the limitation period for enforcement, ie the execution of the judgment of the court, will then be 12 years as clearly prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>. In the present case since the Award was registered as the judgment of the court on 19 January 2004, the appellant would have 12 years from the date when the Award becomes a judgment of court to enforce the said judgment. In this case the leave application to enforce or execute the judgment on the 14 March 2012 was filed well within the 12 years period. Having said that and in applying the 12 years limitation period under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> we find that the High Court was therefore correct in finding that the appellant's bankruptcy proceedings were not barred by limitation since it had commenced the action within 12 years from the date of the registration of the Award as the judgment of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> To sum up, on the questions of law posed in this appeal, it is our finding that for the registration of an arbitration award as a judgment of the High Court either pursuant to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_93;;">Arbitration Act 1952</LINK> or <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;;">Arbitration Act 2005</LINK>, the limitation period is six years from the issuance of that award by an arbitration tribunal. As for the arbitration award which has been registered as a judgment of the court, the limitation period is 12 years pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(3) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> to which the award may be enforced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> For the above said reasons, we allow the appeal with costs. The decision of the Court of Appeal is hereby set aside and accordingly the orders of the High Court is hereby reinstated.</p>
