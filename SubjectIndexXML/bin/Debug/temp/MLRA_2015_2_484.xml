    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>On 28 February 2012 the appellant, Tenaga Nasional Berhad ('Tenaga'), commenced an action against the respondent, Pearl Island Resort Development Sdn Bhd ('Pearl Island'), for outstanding sums owing for the supply of electricity. Pearl Island counterclaimed, amongst others, for the imposition of connected load charges ('CLC') that was included in the computation of arrears in a settlement agreement that the parties had entered into on 23 October 2005 as being <i>ultra vires</i> and void on the ground that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;26.;;">s 26 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990</LINK> did not confer any power on Tenaga to impose and compel its customers to pay CLC. At the trial, Pearl Island submitted that Tenaga's claim was statute barred as it was filed after the expiry of six years under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act 1953 ('LA')</LINK>. Tenaga argued that the period of limitation should be calculated from the date Tenaga made a call on a bank guarantee on 31 May 2006, which constituted part payment, and not at the date of default under the settlement agreement on 23 October 2005. Tenaga relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;26.;;">s 26(2) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>. The trial judge limited the application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;26.;;">s 26(2) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> to payments made by Pearl Island itself and not to the call made on the bank guarantee. As for the counterclaim, the judge applied the doctrine of estoppel against Pearl Island on the ground that Pearl Island had voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement and could not now be seen as resiling from the position it had agreed upon. Further, Pearl Island had led Tenaga to believe that it would settle the outstanding sum inclusive of the CLC by agreed instalments. The judge dismissed Tenaga's claim on the ground of limitation and dismissed Pearl Island's counterclaim as being without merits. Hence, Tenaga's appeal and Pearl Island's cross-appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal and cross-appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The two case authorities cited by Tenaga, ie <i>Malaysia Building Society Berhad v. KL Al Dhuha Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> and <i>WTK Holdings Bhd v. Foo Sae Heng &amp; Anor</i>, did not support Tenaga's contention that part-payment did not need to be made by Pearl Island, but could be made by another party, such as the bank on the facts of this appeal when it honoured the call on the bank guarantee resulting in the offsetting of the outstanding sum owing by Pearl Island. In Malaysia Building Society Berhad there was an element of acknowledgement of the debt by the borrower after the expiry of the six years in addition to the agreement to allow the acquisition sum concerned to be paid directly to the plaintiff to offset the loan. Those elements were absent on the facts of this appeal, and therefore Malaysia Building Society Berhad was distinguishable on the facts, and was not an authority for a broad proposition of law that part-payment could be made by any third party for <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;26.;;">s 26(2) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> to apply. As for <i>WTK Holdings Bhd v. Foo Sae Heng &amp; Anor</i>, the facts disclosed that an associate company of the borrower made the part-payment. The Court of Appeal in fact decided that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;26.;;">s 26(2) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> could not apply because it was not established that the associate company had acted as an agent of the borrower when it paid the lender. Thus, if anything, that case was an authority for the proposition that part-payment must be made by the defendant himself or by his authorised agent. The bank, on the facts of this appeal, could not be equated in law as an agent of Pearl Island in relation to the payment on the call on the bank guarantee. (paras 19-20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The judge had correctly analysed the facts and the law. There was no error, whether of law or in the evaluation of the evidence, that warranted any appellate intervention. The judge was thus correct in dismissing both Tenaga's claim and Pearl Island's counterclaim. (para 21)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court in Penang which dismissed the claim by Tenaga Nasional Berhad (the appellant) for outstanding sums due from Pearl Island Resort Development Sdn Bhd (the respondent) arising a Contract to Supply Electricity dated 6 June 2001 ("contract") entered into between the appellant and the respondent for the supply of electricity to the respondent's premises, a club and golf course known as Lot 8134, Jalan Relau, Bayan Lepas, Pulau Pinang.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The Contract was entered into pursuant to an application for Supply of Electricity dated 4 January 2001 by the respondent for electricity to be supplied at the respondent's premise, and in this application the respondent had requested that it be supplied with a maximum load of 2270 kW. This request for the supply of the maximum load was incorporated into the contract. By this contract, the respondent was to pay the monthly Connected Load Charges ("CLC Charges") if the maximum load recorded was less than 75% of the declared load of 2270 kW at the rate of RM8.50 kW.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondent defaulted in settling the charges for electricity consumed at the premises. It wrote to the appellant to request for indulgence to pay the charges outstanding (without CLC charges) by 12 monthly instalments. This letter dated 16 August 2004 appears on p 87, vol. 2, Appeal Record. A deed of settlement was then entered into on 10 June 2005, whereby the respondent agreed to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The arrears and the current charges outstanding included the CLC charges as well.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The Schedule of Payment in the deed of settlement provided as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The respondent only paid a total sum of RM75,000.00 for the months of June 2005, July 2005 and August 2005 and thereafter defaulted in making payments as agreed. Consequently, the supply of electricity to the respondent's premises was disconnected on 5 October 2005, after the respondent failed to comply with the appellant's letter dated 21 September 2005 that demanded the respondent settle the accumulated unpaid arrears and current payments which stood at RM531,473.06 as at 21 September 2005, and the subsequent Notice to Disconnect dated 24 September 2005. The notice to disconnect gave the respondent notice to make payment of an adjusted outstanding sum of RM576,103.76 within 30 days. The respondent did not settle the instalment for 24 September 2005, and its earlier request that it be exempted from paying the CLC charges was rejected by the appellant in the appellant's very same letter dated 21 September 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondent had secured a Bank Guarantee from Eon Bank Berhad for the sum of RM80,000.00 to guarantee the payment of electricity charges as part of the agreement to supply the electricity to the respondent's premises. The appellant made a call on this Bank Guarantee on 14 February 2006, and the sum of RM80,000.00 was then credited into the respondent's account with the appellant on 31 May 2005, leaving an outstanding amount of RM527,276.86 as due and payable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> A Notice of Demand for the outstanding amount was issued on 30 July 2008 to the respondent. When the respondent failed to respond, the appellant then utilised the deposit of RM13,219.47 and RM3,310.22 from the other accounts of the respondent, leaving a total outstanding amount due and owing by the respondent to the appellant of RM510,747.17. That was the amount claimed by the appellant in this suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant instituted this action on 28 February 2012. The respondent argued the appellant's claim was statute barred as it had been filed after the expiry of six years applicable for contractual claims under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>. It was also alleged by the respondent that the appellant had acted wrongfully and in contravention of the relevant regulations (the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1990_384;;">Licensee Supply Regulations 1990</LINK>) by disconnecting the electricity to the premises and that the deed of settlement entered into was null and void, being <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the appellant under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;;">Electricity Supply Act 1990 ('Act 447')</LINK> when it imposed the 'connected load charges' which had been included in the computation of the arrears.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The respondent filed a counterclaim against the appellant claiming <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The learned High Court Judge dismissed both the appellant's claim and the respondent's counterclaim with costs to be borne by each party. In dismissing the appellant's claim in the High Court, the trial judge agreed with the contention of the respondent that the claim was barred by limitation, but dismissed the counterclaim as being without merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant had argued that the period of limitation should be calculated from the date the call on the Bank Guarantee was made and the monies credited, namely 31 May 2006, and not the date of default under the settlement agreement - 23 October 2005 - being the last day following the giving of the 30 days' notice to settle the outstanding sums by the letter of 24 September 2005 ("Notis Pemotongan Bekalan Elektrik"). The appellant relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;26.;;">s 26(2) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, reading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The learned trial judge limited the application of this provision to situations where the "part payment" was made by the defendant itself, not by virtue of a call on the Bank Guarantee, holding:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> As regards the arguments taken on the counterclaim, the trial judge applied the doctrine of estoppel against the respondent (drawing on the principles laid down in <i>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd v. Texas International Commerce Bank Ltd</i> [1982] QB 84, as applied by our Federal Court in the oft-cited case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_738;"><i>Boustead Trading (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank Berhad</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 738</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 331; [1995] 4 CLJ 283; [1995] 3 AMR 2871) on the basis that the respondent had voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement and it could not now be seen as resiling from the position that it had agreed and had led the appellant to believe that it would settle the amounts to the appellant due inclusive of the CLC by the agreed instalments, which it now argued at trial as being <i>ultra vires</i> and void on the ground that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;26.;;">s 26 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990</LINK> did not confer any power on the appellant to impose and compel its customers to pay CLC. The CLC effectively allowed the appellant to charge the respondent for electricity not actually utilised, whereas it could only impose a surcharge for late payments under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;26A.;;">s 26A of the same Act</LINK>. The trial judge emphasised that the respondent overlooked <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;29.;;">s 29(1)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;29.;;">s 29(2) of the Act</LINK> which qualified <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;26.;;">s 26</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;26A.;;">s 26A</LINK> by expressly providing that there could be a special agreement entered into whereby the rights and obligations of the parties would be governed by this special agreement. The imposition of the CLC therefore was not <i>ultra vires</i> the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;;">Electricity Supply Act 1990</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The CLC, according to the finding of the trial judge, was not unilaterally imposed but was agreed to by the respondent. The respondent failed to call one Tan Swee Leong who was potentially a crucial witness for the respondent since he signed the settlement agreement on behalf of the respondent. An adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK> was drawn against the respondent for this failure to call a crucial witness who could have either confirmed or denied whether the imposition of the CLC was agreed by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The respondent also questioned the accuracy of the outstanding charges, but this point merely taken generally and it did not show the particulars of any manifest error to the court. The learned trial judge stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In these circumstances, the disconnection of the electricity supply to the respondent's premises was lawfully effected with prior notice under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1990_384;;">Licensee Supply Regulations 1990</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In the submission before us in the appeal, the respondent revisited these arguments in its cross-appeal. The appellant, on the other hand, limited its grounds to the issue of limitation, which it advanced as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Although formulated as two grounds, it was evident that a negative answer to ground (i) would effectively settle ground (ii).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In the course of the submissions before us, counsel for the appellant cited two case authorities to support the appellant's contention that the  part-payment did not need to be made by the respondent itself, but could be made by another party, such as the bank on the facts of this appeal when it honoured the call on the Bank Guarantee resulting in the offsetting of the amount payable by RM80,000.00 on 31 May 2006 when the amount was paid into the respondent's account. Since the plaintiff's/appellant's action was filed on 27 February 2012, it was not barred by limitation. The two case authorities are <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_7_924;"><i>Malaysia Building Society Berhad v. KL Al Dhuha Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2011] 7 MLRH 924</LINK> (a case heard by me as a High Court Judge) and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_810;"><i>WTK Holdings Bhd v. Foo Sae Heng &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 810</LINK>; [2011] 5 CLJ 433. We were not persuaded any of these cases supported the appellant's contention. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_7_924;"><i>Malaysia Building Society Berhad v. KL Al Dhuha Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i></LINK> (supra), which concerned a default of payment on a loan, the borrower had actually agreed with the plaintiff (the lender) that it would allow a sum of RM1 million to be utilised by the lender to offset the amount outstanding when the sum was received from Jabatan Alam Sekitar as consideration for an acquisition of part of the charged property. The borrower agreed to allow the lender to receive that sum directly from Jabatan Alam Sekitar for this purpose. The loan had been in default since November 2001. The part payment was made in January 2008. The suit for recovery of the loan was filed in 2010. There was an element of acknowledgement of the debt by the borrower after the expiry of the six years from the accrual of cause of action in addition to the agreement to allow the acquisition sum to be paid directly to the plaintiff to offset the loan. These elements are absent on the facts of this instant appeal, and therefore <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_7_924;"><i>Malaysia Building Society Berhad v. KL Al Dhuha Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i></LINK> (supra), is distinguishable on the facts, and is not an authority for a broad proposition of law that a part payment can be made by any third party for <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;26.;;">s 26(2) of the Limitation Act</LINK> to apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> As for <i>WTK Holdings Bhd v. Foo Sae Heng &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, the facts disclose that the part-payment was made by an associate company of the borrower. The Court of Appeal in fact decided that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;26.;;">s 26(2)</LINK> could not apply because it was not established on the evidence that the associate company had acted as an agent of the borrower when it paid the lender. Thus, if anything this case is an authority for the proposition that partpayment must be made by the defendant himself or by his authorised agent. The bank, on the facts of this instant appeal, could not, in our view, be equated in law as an agent of the respondent in relation to the payment on the call on the Bank Guarantee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Having considered the Grounds of Judgment of the learned trial judge and considered the submissions of counsel before us, particularly in light of the two case authorities referred to earlier, we could not find any appealable error to warrant our intervention. In His Lordship's meticulous judgment, the facts and the law had been correctly analysed. There was no clear error whether of law or in the evaluation of the evidence that warranted any appellate intervention. The High Court was thus correct to dismiss both the plaintiff 's claim and the defendant's counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Thus, for the reasons analysed above, we were of the unanimous opinion that both the appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed. That being so, we further decided that there be no order as to costs. The deposit was ordered to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
