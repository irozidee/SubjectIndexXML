    <p>The 2nd appellant was the registered owner of some lands in Telok Chempedak Kuantan where Hotel Hyatt Regency Kuantan ('the hotel') was situated, whilst the 1st appellant is the current registered owner of the said lands including the hotel, having purchased them from the 2nd appellant vide a Sales and Purchase Agreement ('SPA'). The respondents, who were represented by their union, the National Union of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers, Peninsular Malaysia ('the Union'), were former employees of the 2nd appellant, and were terminated from their services when the 2nd appellant sold its lands and assets to the 1st appellant. The respondents were in due course served with notices of termination which contained therein offers to pay them specified sums of money as "termination benefits and other payments" in accordance with the terms of their employment. The respondents acknowledged receiving the notices and payments offered to them. Nevertheless the respondents remained dissatisfied and took their case to the Industrial Court claiming that they were dismissed without just cause or excuse, in breach of the Collective Agreement ('CA') entered into between the 2nd appellant and the Union. At the Industrial Court, the respondents' claims were dismissed. Being aggrieved by the decision of the Industrial Court, the respondents applied to the High Court for judicial review. The High Court, however, dismissed the respondents' application for judicial review with costs. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed their appeal with costs, quashed the award of the Industrial Court, set aside the decision of the High Court and ordered that compensation and backwages be paid to the respondents, <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement. The appellants subsequently applied for leave to appeal to this court against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the following questions: (a) Whether an article of a Collective Agreement that seeks to result in the automatic transfer of employees from the present employer to another non-party of the Collective Agreement, without the consent of the non-party of the Collective Agreement and/or employees, can be enforceable under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">Industrial Relations Act 1967 ('Act')</LINK> and/or Industrial Law?; and (b) Whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17 of the Act</LINK> applies only to ensuring the continuity of the terms and conditions of a CA in the context of successors, assignees or transferees or can it apply to mandate a purchaser of asset and/or business to continue to employ the former employees of the asset/business. Thus, the central issue here was whether the 'Hotel' had changed 'ownership' within the meaning of art 2.4 of the CA which stated that in the event the hotel changed ownership, the CA remained valid and all the employees continued to remain in service to enjoy the same entitlements as contracted for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Industrial Court, in applying its powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK>, ought to have borne in mind the underlying objectives and purposes of the Act, which is a piece of legislation to ensure social justice for both employers and employees and to advance the progress of industry by bringing about harmony and cordial relationship between the parties; to eradicate unfair labour practices; to protect workmen against victimisation by employers and to ensure termination of industrial disputes in a peaceful manner. Thus technical rules such as estoppel, limitation, laches, acquiescence (unless otherwise provided in the Act) have no place in industrial adjudication and they should not be allowed to be invoked to defeat claims which are just and proper. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was in fact a change of ownership of the hotel, within the meaning of art 2.4 of the CA, pursuant to the sale of the hotel by the 2nd appellant to the 1st appellant. The hotel did not cease operations after being taken over by the 1st appellant. Furthermore, it was provided in the SPA that the vendor (2nd appellant) shall give vacant possession of the property to the purchaser (1st appellant) on the completion date, and in that event, the purchaser shall take over the whole hotel operations and shall bear all expenses and enjoy profits from the completion date. It was therefore obvious that the hotel business of the 2nd appellant was transferred and taken over by the 1st appellant as a going concern. In a transfer as a going concern, the business remained the same but in different hands. (paras 33 &amp; 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The 1st appellant's contention that it was not bound by the CA was without any merit. In any event and independently of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1) of the Act</LINK>, the 1st appellant which had agreed by cl 9 of the SPA to assume the rights and liabilities of the 2nd appellant, could not say that it was not bound by the CA. (para 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The two questions of law posed to this court were basically questions relating to the construction of an article in the CA and a provision in a statute. The first question was on the construction of art 2.4 of the CA which had to be decided on the peculiar facts adduced before the Industrial Court. The answer to the question was dependent on the facts of the case. In the present circumstances, there was a change of ownership within the meaning of art 2.4 of the CA. Thus the parties were bound by it. (para 41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The second question was on the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. Following this court's decision in <i>Kesatuan Kebangsaan Wartawan Malaysia &amp; Anor v. Syarikat Pemandangan Sinar Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i>, the ultimate decision of whether the purchaser is a successor, assignee or transferee within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> would be dependent on whether it could be established that the purchaser is a successor, assignee or transferee. In the instant appeal, there was no doubt that the 1st appellant was the successor, assignee or transferee of the 2nd appellant in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A Samah Nordin FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal has its origin in the Industrial Court. Kuantan Beach Hotel Sdn Bhd (2nd appellant) was the registered owner of the lands in Telok Chempedak Kuantan where the hotel, known as Hyatt Regency Kuantan is situated. Alam Venture Sdn Bhd (1st appellant) is the current registered owner of the said lands having purchased them together with the buildings thereon and all the assets from the 2nd appellant. The respondents were former employees of the 2nd appellant, who claimed to have been dismissed without just cause or excuse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 2nd appellant was then facing financial difficulty. Its lands on which the hotel is sited on had been subjected to foreclosure proceedings. Its shareholder, Pasdec Resources Sdn Bhd had been wound up. Thus on 25 April 2005 it executed a sale and purchase agreement ('SPA') with the 1st appellant to sell its lands and assets to the latter. Some of the terms of the SPA were later varied by way of two supplemental sale and purchase agreements executed between the parties, dated 11 November 2005 and 22 March 2006 respectively. We will revert to the relevant terms of these agreements later.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 23 August 2005 the 2nd appellant was placed under receivership by the debenture holder, AM Merchant Bank Bhd and PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed as the Manager and Receiver of the 2nd appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondents were represented by their union, the National Union of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers, Peninsular Malaysia ('the Union'). On 15 November 2005 the Manager and Receiver informed the Union that due to the 2nd appellant's financial position, it was no longer a feasible option for the 2nd appellant to continue its hotel operations and to remain in the hotel industry. It has no alternative but to sell its assets and to carry out a termination exercise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondents were in due course served with notices of termination which contained therein offers to pay them specified sums of money as "termination benefits and other payments" in accordance with the terms of their employment. The respondents acknowledged receiving the notices and payments offered to them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Nevertheless they remained unsatisfied and took their case to the Industrial Court claiming that they were dismissed without just cause or excuse, in breach of the collective agreement entered into between the 2nd appellant and the Union. In their claims, they sought to be reinstated without any loss of wages, allowances, service, seniority, privileges or benefits of any kind and/or such other order or alternative relief as the court deems fit and proper.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 1st appellant was added as a party by order of the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Industrial Court, after a full hearing, dismissed the respondents claims against the appellants. The Industrial Court held that the 2nd appellant had terminated the services of the respondents with just cause or excuse. In respect of the 1st appellant the Industrial Court held that it was not a party to the collective agreement and that the respondents were never employed by the 1st appellant and hence their services were never terminated by the 1st appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The respondents, being aggrieved by the decision of the Industrial Court, applied to the High Court for judicial review pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC')</LINK> seeking the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The Kuantan High Court dismissed the respondents' application for judicial review with costs. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed their appeal with costs, quashed the award of the Industrial Court, set aside the decision of the High Court and ordered that compensation and backwages be paid to the respondents, <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement. The Court of Appeal made a further order that the matter be remitted to the Industrial Court for assessment of compensation and backwages to be paid by the 1st appellant. The appellants then applied for leave to appeal to this court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 28 August 2013 this court granted leave to the appellants to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It is therefore imperative to look at the reasonings of the courts below in arriving at their decisions before addressing the issues raised in the appeal before us. The central dispute between the contesting parties is on the proper construction of art 2.4 of the collective agreement <i>vis-a-vis</i> the facts adduced before the Industrial Court. Article 2.4 of the collective agreement states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The 1st appellant is not a party to the collective agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Industrial Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> After a full trial and evaluation of the evidence before it the Industrial Court came to the following findings of facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Based on those findings the Industrial Court held that the 2nd appellant did not breach art 2.4 of the collective agreement. The Industrial Court found that the 2nd appellant had acted in accordance with the code of industrial harmony and established principles of law and was justified in terminating the services of the respondents as it had ceased its hotel business. In the result, the Industrial Court dismissed the respondents' claims against the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The High Court agreed with the findings of facts by the Industrial Court and its conclusion that the 2nd appellant had terminated the respondents' services with just cause or excuse and that such termination was not in breach of art 2.4 of the collective agreement. The High Court reiterated the principle that in a judicial review application the court's function is to decide whether the decision-making process was done in accordance with the law. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which the decision was made and that the High Court is not entitled in an application for judicial review to consider whether the decision itself, on the merits of the facts was fair and reasonable: (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1990_1_34;"><i>Harpers Trading (M) Sdn Bhd v. National Union Of Commercial Workers</i> [1990] 1 MELR 34</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_536;">[1990] 1 MLRA 536</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 417; [1991] 1 CLJ 159). The High Court ruled that the Industrial Court had not exceeded its jurisdiction and that it has no basis to intervene or set aside the decision of the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The Court of Appeal allowed the appellants' appeal, among others, on the following grounds. Firstly, it was inappropriate for the courts below to apply the strict and legalistic approach in construing art 1 and art 2.4 of the collective agreement in its literal meaning. It preferred the reasonable and pragmatic approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_304;"><i>Kesatuan Pekerja-Pekerja Perkayuan v. Syarikat Jengka Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 1 MELR 304</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_471;">[1996] 2 MLRA 471</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 464; [1997] 2 CLJ 276; [1997] 1 AMR 133 which held that ordinary rules of construction which necessarily involve a rather strict and legalistic approach, did not apply when interpreting a collective agreement, which is not a commercial agreement but a document dealing with far more basic issues pertaining to the livelihood of workmen. Parliament, in recognising the importance of providing a conducive working environment and promoting a harmonious relationship between the employer and the employees or workmen, had enacted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK> which enjoins the court to act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities and legal form.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Secondly, the courts below failed to appreciate that when construed as a whole, the SPA entered into between the 1st and 2nd appellants in fact and law resulted in a change of the ownership of the business of the hotel within the meaning of art 2.4 of the collective agreement. The word "hotel" in art 1 of the SPA refers to "Kuantan Beach Hotel Sdn Bhd trading as Hyatt Regency Kuantan". By applying the broad and pragmatic approach the Court of Appeal concluded that the word "hotel" refers also to the business of the 2nd appellant. The Court of Appeal had scrutinised the terms of the SPA and the supplemental agreements in their entirety <i>vis-a-vis</i> the evidence adduced before the Industrial Court and came to the conclusion that the hotel business of the 2nd appellant was transferred as a going concern to the 1st appellant. As such there was in law and in fact a change of ownership within the meaning of art 2.4 of the collective agreement. There was continuity in the business of the hotel after the 1st appellant bought over the property from the 2nd appellant, a fact which was confirmed by Dato' Anuarul Aini bin Mohd Perai, who testified for the 1st appellant. The hotel never ceased its operations and continued to be managed by the same management company under a new contract. Thus, the Court of Appeal held that the decision of the High Court in affirming the decision of the Industrial Court that there was no change of ownership was irrational.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Thirdly, the courts below erred in holding that the 1st appellant was not bound by the collective agreement as it was not a party to it. The respondents contended that the 1st appellant was bound by the collective agreement as the successor assignee or transferee of the 2nd appellant. The Court of Appeal held that the 1st appellant was bound by the collective agreement for two reasons:</p>

      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The circumstances under which the High Court can interfere with the decision of the Industrial Court are limited. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1990_1_34;"><i>Harpers Trading (M) Sdn Bhd v. National Union Of Commercial Workers</i> [1990] 1 MELR 34</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_536;">[1990] 1 MLRA 536</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 417; [1991] 1 CLJ 159, it was said that judicial review is not an appeal but a review of the manner in which the decision was made and the High Court is not entitled in an application for judicial review to consider whether the decision itself, on the merits of the facts, was fair and reasonable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1976_1_10;"><i>Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union &amp; Ors v. South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn Bhd</i> [1976] 1 MLRA 10</LINK>; [1976] 2 MLJ 67 the Federal Court had made it clear that the Industrial Court was charged with findings of fact and "unless it can be shown that the evidence was so much one way that no reasonable tribunal could have disregarded it, it is not possible to interfere with its findings of facts".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The court may intervene on the ground that the decision-maker had acted on no evidence or had come to a conclusion which on evidence it could not reasonably come: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1988_1_8;"><i>Malayan Banking Bhd v.

Minister of Housing and Local Government</i> [1971] 1 WLR 433. It is now settled law that the courts may review the decision of an inferior tribunal on the grounds of illegality, irrationality and possibly proportionality: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_71;"><i>R Rama Chandran v.

In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2003_1_21;"><i>Petroliam Nasional Bhd v. Nik Ramli Nik Hassan</i> [2003] 1 MELR 21</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_2_114;">[2003] 2 MLRA 114</LINK>; [2004] 2 MLJ 288; [2003] 4 CLJ 625 this court however clarified that not every case was amenable to judicial review pursuant to the principle in R Rama Chandran's case. It should only be invoked in appropriate cases. There may be cases in which for reasons of public policy, national interest, public safety or national security it may be wholly inappropriate for the courts to attempt any substitution of views: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_398;"><i>Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd v. Zaid Mohd Noh</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 398</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 789; [1997] 2 CLJ 11; [1997] 1 AMR 1008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> A decision of an inferior tribunal is amenable to judicial review where the facts do not support the conclusion arrived at by the tribunal or the findings of the tribunal had been arrived at by taking into consideration irrelevant matters or disregarding relevant matters: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2012_1_129;"><i>Ranjit Kaur S Gopal Singh v.

    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is not in dispute that the 2nd appellant had not changed its name or merged with another company. The central issue is whether the 'hotel' has changed 'ownership' within the meaning of art 2.4 of the collective agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The word 'hotel' in art 2.4 refers to 'Kuantan Beach Hotel Sdn Bhd trading as Hyatt Regency Kuantan' which is identified in art 1 as a party to the collective agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Article 2.4 of the collective agreement clearly states that in the event the hotel changed ownership, the collective agreement remains valid and all the employees shall continue to remain in service to enjoy the same entitlements as contracted for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The problem arose when the respondents' employer, the 2nd appellant, terminated the respondents' services after selling its land and the building thereon, including the hotel and other assets, to the 1st appellant. The respondents' claimed that they were dismissed without just cause or excuse and should be reinstated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The 2nd appellant contended that it was not liable under art 2.4 of the collective agreement as it had not changed ownership. It continued to exist although placed under receivership. The respondents contended otherwise. The Industrial Court and the High Court decided in its favour. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the respondents' appeal, set aside the orders of the courts below, holding that the respondents were dismissed without just cause or excuse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Clearly, the disagreement between the parties is over the construction of art 2.4 of the Collective Agreement. The Court of Appeal and the courts below, that is the High Court and the Industrial Court, arrived at different conclusions on the same facts before them because they differed in their approaches in the interpretation of the Collective Agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The High Court adopted a strict and legalistic approach and construed art 2.4 of the collective agreement in its literal meaning. The Court of Appeal held that it was inappropriate to apply the ordinary rules of construction in interpreting art 2.4 of the Collective Agreement, which is not a commercial agreement but a document governing the relations between the employer and the employees or workmen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK> was specifically enacted by Parliament to regulate the relations between employers and workmen and their trade unions and the prevention and settlement of any differences or disputes arising from their relationship and generally to deal with trade dispute and matters arising therefrom: See long title to the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Thus, in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK> the legislature in plain and simple language enjoins that the Industrial Court, in making the award "shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities and legal form".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Our courts had, on numerous occasions expressed the views that such awards must be decided in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK>. Ordinary rules of construction do not apply in interpreting the terms of a Collective Agreement: See <i>Kesatuan Pekerja-Pekerja Perkayuan v. Syarikat Jengka Sdn (supra)</i>. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2004_1_56;"><i>Tanjong Jara Beach Hotel Sdn Bhd v. National Union Of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers Peninsular Malaysia</i> [2004] 1 MELR 56</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_237;">[2004] 2 MLRA 237</LINK>; [2004] 4 CLJ 657; [2005] 2 AMR 270, the Federal Court once again emphasised that the Industrial Court in applying its powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK> has to bear in mind the underlying objectives and purposes of the Act, which is a piece of legislation to ensure social justice for both employers and employees and to advance the progress of industry by bringing about harmony and cordial relationship between the parties; to eradicate unfair labour practices; to protect workmen against victimization by employers and to ensure termination of industrial disputes in a peaceful manner. Similar views had been echoed in the past: see for example, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_412;"><i>Wong Yuen Hock v. Syarikat Hong Leong Assurance Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 412</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 753; [1995] 3 CLJ 344; [1995] 2 AMR 2145, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_42;"><i>Harris Solid State (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Bruno Gentil Pereira &amp; Ors</i> [1996] 1 MELR 42</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_665;">[1996] 1 MLRA 665</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 489; [1996] 4 CLJ 747, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2002_1_4;"><i>Telekom Malaysia Kawasan Utara v.

Thus technical rules such as estoppel, limitation, laches, acquiescence (unless otherwise provided in the Act) have no place in industrial adjudication and they should not be allowed to be invoked to defeat claims which are just and proper: See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1991_2_271;"><i>Nadarajah &amp; Anor v. Golf Resort (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [1991] 2 MELR 271</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_4_352;">[1991] 4 MLRH 352</LINK>; [1991] 1 ILR 704.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We agree with the Court of Appeal that there was in fact a change of ownership of the hotel, within the meaning of art 2.4 of the collective agreement pursuant to the sale of the hotel by the 2nd appellant to the 1st appellant. As a result of the sale the hotel business, which was the core business, if not the sole business of the 2nd appellant was transferred and taken over by the 1st appellant. Article 2.4 clearly states that in the event of a change of ownership, the collective agreement remains valid and shall continue to apply and that all the employees shall continue to remain in service to enjoy the same entitlements as contracted for. The hotel did not cease operations after being taken over by the 1st appellant. To ensure continuity of the hotel business, the 1st appellant entered into a new management agreement with Hyatt Hotel Management Limited on 27 January 2006, which was one day before the 2nd appellant terminated its management agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It is provided in cl 12(a) of the SPA that the vendor (2nd appellant) shall give vacant possession of the property to the purchaser (1st appellant) on the completion date and in that event the purchaser shall take over the whole hotel operations and shall bear all expenses and enjoy profits from the completion date. It is therefore obvious that the hotel business of the 2nd appellant was transferred and taken over by the 1st appellant as a going concern. In a transfer as a going concern the business remains the same but in different hands: see <i>Melon v. Hector Powe Ltd</i> [1981] 1 All ER 313 which was referred to in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1984_2_383;"><i>Abdul Aziz Atan &amp; Ors v. Ladang Rengo Malay Estate Sdn Bhd</i> [1984] 2 MELR 383</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1984_1_446;">[1984] 1 MLRH 446</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 165; [1985] CLJ 370. The High Court construed art 2.4 of the collective agreement in its literal meaning when it held that the 2nd appellant had not changed ownership and continued to exist by the same name even after selling its property to the 1st appellant. It did not consider the change of ownership of the hotel as a change of ownership within the meaning of art 2.4 of the Collective Agreement. Such an interpretation of art 2.4 would not be in accord with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK>. It must not be forgotten that the respondents, who were employees of the 2nd appellant, were actually employed to work at the hotel which had been taken over by the 1st appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> By cl 9 of the SPA the 1st appellant has contracted to assume the rights and liabilities of the 2nd appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Section 17 Of The Act</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Section 17 of the Act states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Section 17 of the Act had been judicially considered by this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2001_1_21;"><i>Kesatuan Kebangsaan Wartawan Malaysia &amp; Anor v. Syarikat Pemandangan Sinar Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2001] 1 MELR 21</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_309;">[2001] 1 MLRA 309</LINK>; [2001] 3 MLJ 705; [2001] 3 CLJ 547; [2001] 4 AMR 3813.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In that case the collective agreement in question was between Kesatuan Kebangsaan Wartawan Malaysia (1st appellant) and Sin Poh (Star News) Amalgamated Malaysia Sdn Bhd ("Sin Poh") which was given the permit to publish the newspaper, Sin Chew Jit Poh Malaysia. On 3 September 1987 Sin Poh was placed under receivership. On 28 October 1987, the Minister cancelled the permit. On 23 March 1988 the Minister issued the permit to publish the same newspaper to Syarikat Pemandangan Sinar Sdn Bhd (1st respondent), which then reemployed 85% of Sin Poh's employees. On 6 April 1988 the Receiver and Manager of Sin Poh entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Syarikat Rimbunan Hijau Estate Sdn Bhd (2nd respondent) and sold all the physical assets of Sin Poh to the latter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The 1st and 2nd respondents were not parties to the collective agreement. The Industrial Court held that they were successors, assignees or transferees of a party to the collective agreement and bound by it. The High Court agreed with the Industrial Court. The Court of Appeal held otherwise. Leave to appeal to the Federal Court was granted as to whether the 1st and 2nd respondents were successors, assignees or transferees of Sin Poh under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. The Federal Court held that the 1st and 2nd respondents were bound by the collective agreement as successors, assignees or transferees of Sin Poh. The Federal Court reasoned that the provision of the Act, (ie <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)</LINK> "cuts across the law of contract" and that its rationale is one of "continuity of the Collective Agreement" from the original parties and members of the union to their successors, assignees or transferees in order to ensure that the rights and obligations of the parties are preserved by those taking over.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The 1st appellant's contention that it was not bound by the collective agreement was therefore without any merit. In any event and independently of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1) of the Act</LINK>, the 1st appellant which had agreed by cl 9 of the SPA to assume the rights and liabilities of the 2nd appellant cannot now say that it is not bound by the Collective Agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It appears that the two questions of law posed to this court are basically questions relating to the construction of an article in the collective agreement and a provision in a statute. The first question is on the construction of art 2.4 of the collective agreement which had to be decided on the peculiar facts adduced before the Industrial Court. The answer to the question would be dependent on the facts of the case. In the case before us there was a change of ownership within the meaning of art 2.4 of the Collective Agreement. Thus the parties are bound by it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The second question is on the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>, which had been judicially considered by this court in <i>Kesatuan Kebangsaan Wartawan Malaysia &amp; Anor v. Syarikat Pemandangan Sinar Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor (supra)</i>. In that case, the 1st and 2nd respondents were not parties to the Collective Agreement, but were nevertheless held to be bound as the successors, assignees or transferees of the party to the collective agreement within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. The ultimate decision of whether the purchaser is a successor, assignee or transferee within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> would be dependent on whether it can be established that the purchaser is a successor, assignee or transferee. In the instant appeal there is no doubt that the 1st appellant was the successor, assignee or transferee of the 2nd appellant in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;17.;;">s 17(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. Accordingly we dismiss the appeal by the appellants with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We note that the Court of Appeal had ordered that the case to be remitted to the Industrial Court for assessment of compensation and backwages due to the respondents <i>in lieu</i> of reinstatement without taking into account that they had accepted the termination benefits offered by the 2nd appellant. Therefore whatever amount of termination benefits which had been paid and accepted by the respondents shall be taken into account in assessing the amount of compensation and backwages due to them.</p>
