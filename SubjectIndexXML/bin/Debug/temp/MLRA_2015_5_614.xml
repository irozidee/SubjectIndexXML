      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff was the administrator of the estate of his late mother, and sought various declaratory reliefs and vacant possession in respect of a piece of land ("the land") occupied by his late mother. The defendant claimed he owned the land and had in another action sought vacant possession against SP3. A condition attached to the use of the land only allowed one registered owner. The land was thus registered in the name of the defendant whereas the plaintiff's mother held a charge over the land. The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim but allowed the defendant's claim. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court made a comprehensive appreciation of the case on the basis of the evidence and credibility of the witnesses before it. It would be wrong for an appellate court, which had not seen or heard the witnesses, to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the trial judge. The finding of fact in this case was a finding of credibility and not a finding of fact based upon inferences drawn from other facts. (para 9)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In an appeal, it must be demonstrated to the Court of Appeal that not only there was an error, defect or irregularity, whether in the decision or otherwise, but that it also affected the merits. Only then would appellate intervention be permitted. In the instant case, the plaintiff made no effort to do so. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The defendant was the registered proprietor under the decision of a Land Enquiry standing from 23 March 1964 and had an indefeasible title, whereas the plaintiff's civil suit, commenced in 2004, was without merit. It remained contrary to the National Land Code for the plaintiff to be accepted and registered as an owner of a half share of the land as it stood under the agricultural category. (paras 27 &amp; 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> A registered charge has the effect of preventing the sale of the land, but it is only until the registered charge is discharged. A charge does not give a right to possession, and does not prevent the chargor from seeking vacant possession against a chargee in possession unlawfully. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> This was a case where there were two different versions. As always the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff and it was to prove upon a balance of probabilities. In the instant case, the plaintiff had fallen far short. In failing to demonstrate in any ground of appeal where the High Court had erred affecting the justice of the case, but merely repeating the thesis behind the plaintiff's case, the appeal was little more than disagreeing with the decision of the High Court. That provided no basis for appellate intervention as mandated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. (para 65)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The plaintiff, Othman Mohamed, since deceased ("the plaintiff") and now represented by his son as his legal representative, Ikhram Zahurin Othman, had appealed against the decision of the High Court in Kota Bharu, Kelantan dismissing the claim by the deceased in Kota Bharu HCCS No: 22-119-2007 and "gagal menolak tuntutan defendan sebagaimana tuntutan defendan sebagai plaintif dalam kes Kota Bharu SCCA No: 52-1398-2004 yang dibicarakan bersama-bersama dengan kes Kota Bharu HCCS No: 22-119-2007."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The plaintiff was the administrator of the estate of his mother, the late Hajjah Fatimah Musa ("the plaintiff's mother"), who died on 21 July 1989. The plaintiff began, in 2003, to seek vacant possession of that part of Lot 364, GM180, Mukim Bunut Payung, Jajahan Kota Bharu, Kota Bharu, Kelantan ("the said land") occupied by the plaintiff's mother. He commenced his civil suit in 2004 to seek declarations and orders as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>First Amended Statement Of Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The basis of the plaintiff's case by statement of claim dated 16 September 2007 and first amended on 13 November 2007 ("the first amended statement of claim") was that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Second Amended Statement Of Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The statement of claim was, pursuant to an order of court sought and obtained on 14 December 2010, amended ("second Amended statement of claim"). Paragraph 5 was amended to that Che Esah binti Haji Omar had built one house, not two as originally pleaded. Paragraph 6 was amended to assert that in 1964 Che Esah binti Haji Omar had sold a one-half share of the land to Hajjah Fatimah bt Musa, and had applied to transfer the one half share to Hajjah Fatimah bt Musa and the remaining half share to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The other parts of the statement of claim were maintained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We made the observation that the High Court in its grounds of judgment had correctly set out the material substance of the case in the introduction, the plaintiff's facts of the case, the case for the defendant and the issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In respect of Kota Bharu HCCS No: 22-119-2007, the High Court found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> With regard to Kota Bharu SCCA No: 52-1398-2004, the High Court concluded, on the basis of the findings above, that the defendant herein had proved that he is the owner and because sufficient notice had been given to occupant Suziani bt Abdullah (SP3), the defendant herein is entitled to vacant possession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Observations And Deliberation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b>From the summary above, it is clear that the High Court made a comprehensive appreciation of the case on the basis of the evidence and credibility of the witnesses before it. Particularly in respect of the finding as to the evidence of SD1, would be wrong for an appellate court, which has not seen or heard the witnesses to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the trial judge: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1976_1_93;"><i>Rasidin Bin Partorjo v. Frederick Kiai</i> [1976] 1 MLRA 93</LINK>; [1976] 2 MLJ 214. The finding of fact in this case is a finding of credibility and not a finding of fact based upon inferences drawn from other facts. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_260;"><i>China Airlines Ltd v. Maltran Air Corp Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 260</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 517; [1996] 3 CLJ 163; [1996] 1 AMR 2233.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We proceeded to examine the grounds of appeal addressed in the written submissions for the appellant/plaintiff.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> This ground set out the plaintiff's version of the facts and conclusion to be drawn concluding with the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Clearly, although an appeal is by way of a rehearing (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;5.;;">r 5(1) of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;69.;;">s 69 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>), it is nevertheless an appeal, necessarily so in hearing appeals from trial cases where the appeal court does not have the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses testify and tested before it. Furthermore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the same Act</LINK>, in providing that "No judgment or order of the High Court, or of any judge, shall be reversed or substantially varied on appeal, nor a new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal, on account of any error, defect, or irregularity, whether in the decision or otherwise, not affecting the merits or the jurisdiction of the court." necessitates that it be demonstrated to the Court of Appeal that not only that there was an error, defect, or irregularity, whether in the decision or otherwise, but also it affected the merits. Then only is intervention by an appellate court permitted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The submissions of the first ground made no effort to do so on Ground 1.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The record shows however that Kota Bharu HCCS No: 22-119-2007 and Saman No: 52-1398-2004 were heard together and that both revolved around the same question whether Hajjah Fatimah bt Musa had purchased the ½ share of the said land and built her house thereon. We noted that Suziani bt Abdullah had given evidence as SP3 and the merits of Saman No: 52-1398- 2004 depended entirely upon whether Hajjah Fatimah bt Musa had purchased the ½ share of the said land. SP3's reply under cross-examination that she did not know how her grandmother Hajjah Fatimah bt Musa acquired her ½ share, contradicted her testimony:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The defendant as plaintiff in Saman No: 52-1398-2004 sought vacant possession against Suziani bt Abdullah. In her defence, Suziani bt Abdullah had asserted as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was her defence in Saman No: 52-1398-2004 that she had a right to stay and the defendant herein had no right to vacant possession, and in the light of the finding in respect of Kota Bharu HCCS No. 22-119-2007, the High Court ought to have granted the order in Saman No: 52-1398-2004 sought by the defendant herein as plaintiff in that case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> But although such an order appears in the grounds of judgment dated 15 August 2012, it was not recorded in the record of proceedings of 16 November 2011. The foregoing shows the order should have been to grant the orders sought against the appellant/plaintiff herein. But is it an error, defect or irregularity that affects the merits. It would be for either Suziani bt Abdullah to have the grounds of judgment corrected. But she did not. The respondent/ defendant herein could have applied to the High Court to pronounce the order it should have made on 16 November 2011, but he did not.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The notice of appeal by the plaintiff as appellant herein is that the High Court failed to dismiss Saman No: 52-1398-2004. But it is not a grievance for the plaintiff to have made. The submission that Suziani bt Abdullah was not in occupation of the ½ share of the said land said to have been bought by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa emerged without any evidence adduced as to when Suziani bt Abdullah ceased to occupy the house after her statement of defence asserting her right to stay was filed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In the circumstances, we concluded there was no miscarriage of justice against either Suziani bt Abdullah, the defendant in that case and who did not appeal, and the appellant/plaintiff who seeks to pursue the argument.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The submission took pains to elaborate at some length that Mohd Zainudin bin Mohamed, the Timbalan Pengarah (Pengurusan) of the Pejabat Pengarah Tanah dan Galian Negeri Kelantan (SP1) was an independent witness. He produced the records from the land office. He was not the officer who presided in the land enquiry. Other witnesses for the plaintiff were Othman Bin Mohamed (SP2), the son of Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa, aged 64 years, Suziani binti Abdullah (SP3) aged 41 years and Kamisah binti Abdullah (SP4) aged 49 years, the grand-daughter and adopted daughter respectively of Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa. SP2, SP3 and SP4 were direct witnesses as they lived with Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa. But in respect of the transaction of sale and purchase between Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa and Che Esah binti Omar, they testified to what they heard from Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa. The submissions failed to demonstrate where the High Court erred in describing their testimony as to the purchase transaction as hearsay. Thus, regarding their testimony as to a purchase by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa is essentially hearsay is not demonstrated as an error.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We concluded there was no merit in the submission that the High Court erred in the statement at para [17] of the grounds of judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> SP1 provided the evidence from the records of the land office. He obviously was not involved in the land enquiry between the two parties. He testified as to the notes written. His testimony confirms registration in the name of the defendant, and the words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The words imply there was a request to register two names against the lot, but since it cannot be done, a charge was to be registered against the lot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The note and the charge prove Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa did purchase. But in light of the law, the land could not be registered in two names because the said land was too small, one of them could not be registered as the owner. To accept there can be an unregistered owner circumvents and defeats the restriction by the NLC. Neither the land officer conducting the land enquiry nor the courts can be party to that. The only conclusion that accords with the law is that purchase price paid by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa was converted as a loan paid and secured by a charge. It means that the sum of RM3,000.00 paid by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa should at some point of time be paid back should the registered owner seek vacant possession. We considered also the question of interest when the sum is ordered to be paid back. But neither refund nor interest was pleaded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Considering that (a) the sum being RM3,000.00, (b) Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa and the plaintiff had the benefit of occupation of the land, (c) that no claim for interest had been made at any time, (d) that no request for change of use was made to enable registration of a ½ share to Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa, we concluded that the decision at the land enquiry was accepted by the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa had died on 21 July 1989. The plaintiff inherited from Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa. But it was only in 2003 that he began to seek title and commenced proceedings in 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The defendant as the registered proprietor under the decision of a land enquiry decision standing from 23 March 1964 has an indefeasible title, and the civil suit commenced in 2004 is without merit.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The submission is at best a rhetorical question why, if the document of title is accepted as documentary evidence of the defendant's title, why is not exh P-1, supported by the testimony of SP1, similarly accepted by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Perusal of para [24] of the grounds of judgment shows that it dealt with the value of exh P1. The High Court held it was not clear. It was a note on the record and SP1 testimony was based on that record. Whereas, at para 18, the document of title itself was referred to as documentary evidence showed the defendant as owner of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We concluded the High Court in holding the document of title showed that the defendant is the owner of the whole of the land and the land was charged to Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa, while the note on the record provided the additional information we have quoted at our para [23]. Since it is against the NLC to have the name of Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa on the title, the note on the record cannot be accepted as evidence of ownership, but merely supports what is recorded on the grant that the land is charged to Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa. As the registered owner, the defendant's title is indefeasible. Being consistent with the decision of the land enquiry itself, that he be the registered proprietor, and Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa being unable to be a registered proprietor, and made a registered chargee, does not support the submission she continued to have any claim to title. It is not only because she accepted the decision until she died, and the plaintiff as her waris only inherits her position as chargee as she had accepted, but also because it remains contrary to the NLC for the plaintiff to be accepted and registered as an owner of a half share of the land as it stands under the agricultural category.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Since the plaintiff did not plead fraud, it was not a fact in issue. Since it was not a fact in issue, it cannot be the subject of a decision or finding. Therefore the words "Saya mendapati plaintif gagal mengemukakan sebarang keterangan yang menunjukkan bahawa defendan telah memilik tanah tersebut secara penipuan." were not used in the sense of a finding of fact that the plaintiff "failed", but were used in the sense of a comment in the reasoning of the High Court that the plaintiff "did not".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We accepted that a registered charge has the effect of preventing sale of the land, but it is only until the registered charge is discharged. A charge does not give a right to possession, and does not prevent the chargor from seeking vacant possession against a chargee in possession unlawfully.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The matter goes back to the effect of the recorded note of the Public enquiry under LS Ord 51/55 that "Since two names cannot be registered against this lot. Charge to be registered against this lot." It does, to our minds, acknowledge that Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa had purchased the ½ share as claimed. But being against the law, the solution for the predicament was that a charge be registered in favour of Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa for the amount she had paid, against the land. But a charge under the NLC, unlike a mortgage, does not give right of possession let alone to title. Quite evidently since only one name could be on the title, the decision was that the defendant be registered as proprietor on the title and Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa as the chargee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We concluded that the documentary evidence of the public enquiry under LS Ord 51/55 does not support the submission that Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa is owner of a ½ share but only as the chargee. In the circumstances, we found that the High Court did not err affecting the merits.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> To consider the ground objectively, it is necessary to peruse the testimony of SD1:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Her evidence was factual of what she knew and what she never heard or was not told. Viewed objectively, her evidence was neutral and there was no reason to hold she was not more credible. Indeed her credibility or lack thereof was immaterial as it is not the plaintiff's case that she was told or given notice that a ½ share had been sold to Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa, or that to her knowledge Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa had asked her husband the defendant to transfer the half share to her, or to change the category of use of the said land from "Agriculture" to "Building", or that SD1 had been shown an order or document that Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa was the owner of a ½ share of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We, therefore, found no merit on this ground.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We understand this ground, as written, to say that "the High Court erred when it held that the failure of Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa to take steps to change the category of use to "Building" when she knew the land could not be transferred because of the restriction on the land" is unreasonable and contrary to the claim that she was the owner of a ½ share of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The submission in support of the ground repeated the argument that the recorded note of the land enquiry that because two names cannot be registered against the title, Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa was registered as the chargee. We have dealt with this earlier above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In our view, the recorded note of the land enquiry showed the decision made at the enquiry was, as between the defendant and Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa, that the defendant would be registered as the owner and Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa as chargee only. The argument that it was to protect her interest raises the obvious question as to what was the interest. Clearly it could not be interest in the title, as that would be against the NLC. But she had paid for the ½ share for which she could not obtain title to. To interpret the charge as protecting an interest to the land would be to contradict and defeat the NLC. A charge in any case is security for money lent. It follows that the only conclusion is that since she could not obtain title to the ½ share as no doubt intended, the charge was to protect her interest the money she had paid to purchase the ½ share to the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We, therefore, find no merit in this Ground of Appeal.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The main part of the written submission emphasised in bold letters was that the warehouse or store was not built on the ½ share bought and occupied by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa. It was built after Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa had died.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We found no assistance however from the submissions to give some support for the submission as to where was the ½ share bought by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa, where the warehouse or store was located and when it was built.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The point sought to be made with the evidence of SP1 to produce exh "P1" dan exh "P9" was that the documents proved that Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa was the owner of the ½ share of the said land and her ownership was protected by registering a charge in her favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> As we had occasion to allude to earlier above, the evidence of SP1 and exh "P1" dan exh "P9" showed the defendant as the registered owner and that the said land was charged to her. We observed that the charge was as to the whole of the land, not any identified half share. The High Court clearly meant that the intent of making such order could only be testified to by the officer who made the decision at the land enquiry. And even so whether that was material is, in our view, the subject of another issue. It would be a most undesirable precedent to be established.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We refer to our reasoning above.</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>Conclusion And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> We observed that the orders sought at para 15 c, d and e of the statement of claim are contrary to the pleaded case and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code 1965 ("NLC")</LINK> that the land, because of its classification of use as agriculture, with condition to use as "Dusun Macam-macam", and its size as 380 Depa could not be registered in two names. The court cannot make an order that is against the law as it would be a nullity: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> We made the observation that the pleading by the second amendment to the statement of claim, was that (a) Che Esah binti Haji Omar had built only one house for herself and not two, and (b) Che Esah binti Haji Omar sold one half of the land to Hajjah Fatimah bt Musa, who built her house on it. It however is contradicted by the version of Suziani binti Abdullah, the occupant of the house previously occupied by Hajjah Fatimah bt Musa.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> It was and remains the plaintiff's case that the defendant held a half share of the land as a bare trustee, and that the defendant had acted contrary to the rights as to that one half when he claimed title to it and in 2003 issued a notice to Suziani binti Abdullah, who had lived with Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa and remained thereon with the leave and agreement of the beneficiaries of Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa, to surrender vacant possession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> In the related case, Saman No: 52-1398 Tahun 2004 between the defendant herein as plaintiff and Suziani binti Abdullah as defendant, which was dismissed, it was the defence of Suziani binti Abdullah on 15 February 2005 that it was "arwah Musa" who had given half share each to Daud bin Musa and Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[58]</b>The balance of the version of Suziani binti Abdullah is consistent with the position maintained by the plaintiff herein insofar as both relied on what was told by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In Saman No: 52-1398 Tahun 2004, the defendant herein as plaintiff in Saman No: 52-1398 Tahun 2004, maintained in his reply to Suziani binti Abdullah's defence as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The trial was conducted on pleadings on this basis. But no other evidence was adduced other than what was claimed to be told by Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Mohd Zainudin Bin Mohamed, the Timbalan Pengarah (Pengurusan) of the Pejabat Pengarah Tanah dan Galian Negeri Kelantan (SP1):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> He therefore found the testimony of Suziani binti Abdullah (SP3) to be in addition unsafe to be relied upon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> For the defendant were Nik Mek @ Shafigah binti Mohamed (SD1), the defendant's wife, aged 61 years; Mustafa @ Mamat Bin Wan Ishak (SD2), aged 70 years the defendant's younger brother; and Wan Mohd Aeffendi Bin Wan Yusof (SD3), aged 36 the defendant's son.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The evidence of SD1 is that she married the defendant in 1964 and stayed in the house with the defendant and Che Esah binti Haji Omar. According to her, Che Esah binti Haji Omar had never at any time mentioned a half of the land had been sold to Hajjah Fatimah and she had given the whole of the land to the defendant. There is no reason to reject this testimony as it is never the allegation of the plaintiff, nor is there any suggestion that Hajjah Fatimah binti Musa had told her otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> Quite clearly this is a case where there were two different versions. As always the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff and it is to prove upon a balance of probabilities. In this case, the plaintiff had fallen far short. We have given our reasons above after anxious consideration. In failing to demonstrate in any ground of appeal where the High Court had erred affecting the justice of the case, but merely repeated the thesis behind the plaintiff's case, the appeal was little more than disagreeing with the decision of the High Court. That provides no basis for appellate intervention as mandated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 [Act 91]</LINK> which provides that "No judgment or order of the High Court, or of any judge, shall be reversed or substantially varied on appeal, nor a new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal, on account of any error, defect, or irregularity, whether in the decision or otherwise not affecting the merits or the jurisdiction of the court."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal with costs fixed in the sum of RM25,000.00 here and below. We ordered that the deposit be refunded.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
