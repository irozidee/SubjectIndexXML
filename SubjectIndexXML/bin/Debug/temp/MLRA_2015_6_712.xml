    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the findings of the courts below which found that the appellant had misconstrued the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;;">Lembaga Pembangunan Industri Pembinaan Malaysia Act 1994 ('Act')</LINK>, together with the relevant documents, causing it to levy an incorrect amount under the Construction Industry (Collection of Levy) Regulations 1996. The respondent was a registered contractor under the Act and was a consortium of five contractors ('the respondent'), established solely to undertake the impugned construction works. The respondent was awarded vide a letter of award, a contract to participate and construct a national gas plant, with the owner being Petronas Malaysia Liquid Natural Gas Tiga Sdn Bhd ('the owner'). Pursuant to that, the owner and the respondent executed a construction agreement ('EPCC Contract'), while the respondent executed among themselves a consortium agreement to cater for their internal arrangement, an agreement that did not include the owner. Following that, by a notification of imposition of levy ('the notice') the appellant imposed a levy at the prescribed rate of RM13,129,934.05 on the respondent. The respondent disputed the levy sum and instead argued that the correct levy was RM2,802,130.21, arrived at by disregarding sums attributed to the 'offshore works' and the 'non-construction works' and therefore only paid RM2,802,130.21. Accordingly, the appellant filed the instant case claiming the balance on the levy charged. In this appeal, the main question of law to be determined was, whether the appellant had construed the Act and the relevant documents wrongly and determined and imposed an incorrect levy amount.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was obvious from the letter of award that the contract awarded to the consortium was a "fixed non-escalating lump sum Contract Price ...". Whether it was called fixed, non-escalating or lump sum, separately or collectively, the effect was still the same, ie the contract price could not be split up. Further, art 24.3 of the EPCC Contract stipulated that the respondent accepted the deeming provision of being aware that the contract price was lump sum based. Upon a perusal of the relevant documents, the contract entered into by the owner and the respondent was a turnkey contract. The facts fell squarely under the type of contract where it was singular in purpose and at a fixed price. Accordingly, the contract awarded to the respondent by the owner was not divisible and the levy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34 of the Act</LINK> was not restricted to the construction works, which excluded non-construction works such as engineering, procurement, supervision, management, and other ancillary services. (paras 52, 55 &amp; 58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Having perused <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> and the facts of this case, reliance should be placed on the word "includes", rather than alluding to the principle of "<i>noscitur a sociis</i>" as submitted by the respondent. The word "includes" was generally used to enlarge words or phrases in a statute, as in the current Act, with those words or phrases together with those they should include, understood to have their natural meaning. Thus, by the natural meaning, the engineering design procurement works, that formed part of the "construction works", include all "integral and preparatory" work that would have led to a successful performance of the contract. Surely no construction works may be carried out satisfactorily without the requisite design, drawings, supervision or planning preceding it. (paras 61-63)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Although a contractual transaction may involve a series of transactions it may nevertheless be a single transaction for levy purposes. Looking at the scheme in the EPCC Contract as a whole, the transaction was a single transaction. Furthermore, art 8.1 of the EPCC Contract confirmed that it was an indivisible contract and further, that the respondent also anticipated to be levied for the off-shore and non-construction works component. (paras 65 &amp; 67)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the levy was on the contract sum to be paid in Malaysia to the registered contractor's accounts, ie the respondent, and not to individual consortium members. Therefore, as the commercial transaction was undertaken through the respondent, a tax presence was created within Malaysia to enable a levy to be imposed. (paras 68-69)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Suriyadi Halim Omar FCJ: </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Lembaga Pembangunan Industri Pembinaan Malaysia (the appellant) is a statutory body established under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;;">Lembaga Pembangunan Industri Pembinaan Malaysia Act 1994 (the Act)</LINK>. The Act in brief, empowers the appellant to be a one stop body to promote, and stimulate the development and improvement and expansion of the construction industry in Malaysia. The statutory powers and many functions of the appellant are laid down in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;3.;;">ss 3</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;4.;;">4(1) of the Act</LINK>. For clarification, hereinafter any section mentioned in this ground of judgment refers to the section of the Act, unless stated otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34(2)</LINK>, the appellant is authorised to impose on every registered contractor (but before the commencement of any construction works having a contract sum of above RM 500,000) a levy of a quarter per centum of the contract sum. That levy is funneled to a fund set up under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;15.;;">s 15</LINK> to enable the appellant to discharge its functions pursuant to the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> 'Contract sum', as legislated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34(2)</LINK>, is defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">subsection (8) of s 34</LINK> to mean "the consideration for a contract in respect of any construction works". "Construction works" is defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;2.;;">s 2</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant under reg 6(1) of the Construction Industry (Collection of Levy) Regulations 1996 (1996 Regulations) is the relevant authority that determines the contract sum of the construction works, for purposes of the amount of levy. Hereinafter any regulation mentioned will refer to a regulation in the 1996 Regulations unless stated otherwise. By reg 6(2), in determining the contract sum, the appellant may take into consideration the following factors:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In support of its appeal the appellant also alludes to the contract documents exchanged between the owner and the contractor</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The seriousness of the Act is reflected adequately in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34(5)</LINK>, which legislates that when a registered contractor fails to pay any levy due within a prescribed period, the contractor shall be guilty of an offence, and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding of RM50,000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondent is a registered contractor under the Act and is a consortium of five contractors, comprising two foreign parties and three Malaysians (collectively referred to as the respondent) established solely to undertake the impugned construction works. Shorn of the contractual intricacies, the respondent was awarded vide a letter of award dated 29 October 1999, a contract worth USD1,481,254,000 plus Euro 59,640,000 to participate and construct a national gas plant in Bintulu Sarawak, with the owner being Petronas Malaysia Liquid Natural Gas Tiga Sdn Bhd (Owner).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Another relevant contract document executed between the owner and the respondent is the formal Construction Agreement (EPCC Contract) dated 21 January 2000. The respondent executed among themselves a Consortium Agreement dated 21 January 2000 to cater for their internal arrangement, an agreement that did not include the owner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> By a Notification of Imposition of Levy dated 6 December 2000 (the notice) under reg 7 the appellant imposed a levy at the prescribed rate of RM13,129,934.05 on the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The respondent disputed the levy sum and instead argued that the correct levy was RM2,802,130.21, arrived at by disregarding sums attributed to the 'offshore works' and the 'non-construction works'. Ignoring the full amount in the notice, the respondent only paid RM2,802,130.21 thus leaving unpaid a balance of RM10,327,803.84. The appellant then filed an action at the High Court for the balance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> To dispose of the matter the appellant filed an O 14A Rules of the High Court 1980 action. Having gone through the questions, the High Court Judge summed up the issues before him in the following manner, viz whether a levy could be imposed under the Act on construction works which were undertaken outside Malaysia, and whether construction works under the Act would include non-construction works such as engineering, procurement, supervision, management and other ancillary services.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The High Court Judge ruled in favour of the respondent and found that the appellant had misconstrued the Act, together with the relevant documents, causing it to levy an incorrect amount under the 1996 Regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Being dissatisfied, the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal but lost. On 2 September 2013 the appellant successfully obtained leave from this court on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions Of Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant began by submitting that a levy was imposable under the Act on a registered contractor for construction works where the contract sum exceeded RM 500,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It submitted that the respondent was a registered contractor under the Act, comprising a consortium of five contractors, two being foreign parties and three being Malaysians, established solely for the purpose of undertaking the present construction works. Evidentially the Certificate of Registration dated 28 June 2000 was issued in favour of the respondent as a single entity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> With the full contract sum for the project being USD1,481,254,000.00 plus Euro 59,640,000.00 the respondent clearly qualified to be imposed with a levy under the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant clarified that this was an EPCC Contract, ie an Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning contract. It was a single purpose turnkey contract, subject to fixed pricing, and not based on bills of quantities which could be varied. In a word it was a contract that was indivisible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In support of its argument, the appellant referred to the letter of award dated 29 October 1999 (see Tab 3, ACB vol 2), where it is stated that "The Contract is awarded to you based on your commitment to a fixed non-escalating lump sum Contract Price (inclusive of taxes, duties and other related costs) of USD1,481,254,000 plus Euro 59,640,000".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The appellant ventilated that the contract sum constituted the cost of all the resources (including the onshore and offshore portion), and covered the equipment, materials, labour, transportation and all other things necessary for the due execution and completion of the project. There was no justification to divide the contract sum into different parts according to the works done by the individual member contractors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The appellant was not concerned as to how the resources (be it equipment or material) were procured, whether offshore or onshore. As long as the equipment or the other resources were components of the construction works, they were subject to levy imposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The appellant further submitted that from the outset, as per the letter of award, the contract price was also inclusive of taxes and duties by which the contractor could be made liable. Under art 8.1 of the EPCC Contract, the contractor undertook to pay, <i>inter alia</i>, "levies" of "whatever nature" in connection "with the work and payment of the Contract Price".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On the legal aspect, the counsel for the appellant submitted that the definition of the word "construction works", was an enlarged definition under the Act. It was argued that there was no particular word within the definition that fell for interpretation that warrants the application of the maxim "noscitur a sociis".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> To explain its stance, the appellant cited the example of the term "WORK" which was defined in a comprehensive way as a single whole, and not by reference to any divisible components. Article 2 of the EPCC Contract was wide enough in its scope to include all things, and not limited to the preparation and supply, the purchase and manufacture, the provision of all necessary construction equipment, the mobilisation and controlling of adequate labour force, commissioning and testing of the project, etc.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The appellant submitted that it was envisaged by all parties that the preparatory and supply elements were included. That meant the contract was a comprehensive contract which encompassed both construction and non-construction components and falling within the definition of "works".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the levy was for a construction project within the jurisdiction. It was not disputed that the respondent was a registered contractor in Malaysia for purposes of contract works, with the levy imposed on the respondent as the contractor, and not on its individual consortium members.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The appellant clarified that it was only the design work and the procurement of materials that were done offshore, to be brought into Malaysia eventually for the contract works. In short, it was submitted that the above circumstances created enough of a tax presence within Malaysia, to make the levy a Malaysian levy, rather than an extraterritorial levy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondent's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In reply, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the nature of the relationship between the respondent's component members could be gauged from art 2.4 of the Consortium Agreement which states that "In no event shall the parties hereto consider the CONSORTIUM to be, or in any way acts as though as it were, a corporation, partnership or any other form of entity having any independent legal personality whatsoever".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The respondent clarified that it was a consortium of contractors comprising JGC Corporation of Japan, Kellogg Brown Root Inc of USA, Sime Engineering Sdn Bhd, JGC (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, and Kellogg (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd. The latter two are Malaysian subsidiaries of the first two foreign corporations, all of which are part of the contractual arrangements between themselves, jointly and severally guaranteeing the due performance of the contract works.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In essence, it was argued that the respondent was not a single legal entity but a group of companies that came together to collaborate and work on a contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The respondent clarified that the structure of the EPCC Contract was drawn up in accordance with the owner's instructions as it was not the latter's practice to split the offshore and onshore works into two contracts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The respondent highlighted that the EPCC Contract provided for offshore contract price to be paid to the non-Malaysian incorporated members for works performed outside Malaysia, whereas onshore contract price would be paid to the Malaysian incorporated members for works performed within Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The respondent submitted that the levy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34</LINK> was restricted to the construction works component of the EPCC Contract, and excluded non-construction works such as engineering, procurement, supervision, management, and other ancillary services.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The respondent submitted that the definition of "construction works" in s 2, focused on the physical work performed, and the works mentioned in paras (a) to (e) of the definition therefore must not stray from the physical nature of all works described in the definition and must necessarily be works carried out on-site. Thus, the contract sum constituted the cost of all the resources excluding the offshore portion when it came to the levy imposition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The respondent submitted that it was crucial to read the definition of "construction works" harmoniously, and as part of an integral whole, and as being interdependent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Applying the "<i>noscitur a sociis</i>" principle, paras (a) to (e) and the examples of works must be read together, in order to ascertain the true meaning of the phrase "an integral part of, or are preparatory to or temporary for the works described in paras (a) to (e)". In this regard, the respondent submitted that the court ought to take into account the words or phrases preceding the words which were being interpreted to ensure that they were of the same kind (<i>ejusdem generis</i>) with the rest of the definition, and the Act as a whole, and referable to the same subject matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The respondent relied on s 1(2), which states that the application of the Act is confined to Malaysia, hence not having any extraterritorial application. No levy thus could be imposed on offshore works. In the instant case, the respondent highlighted that the design, procurement and engineering works were all works performed outside of Malaysia, ie offshore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> That being the case, the appellant had no power to impose any levy on works carried out and performed outside of Malaysia hence exceeding its authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We begin by briefly discussing the mode of action, which alludes to O 14A of the Rules. This order enables the High Court to determine any question of law or construction of documents arising in any cause or matter at any stage of the proceedings, where to the court such questions are suitable for determination without going through a full trial, and that determination will dispose of the entire matter. In order to do that it is crucial that all the necessary and material facts relating to the subject matter of the question have been duly proved or admitted. In a gist there are no substantial factual disputes left to be resolved. In <i>The Malaysian High Court Practice 2001 Desk Edition</i> at para 14A.1.3, the writers authored:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> From the submission and evidence before us, we are satisfied that the factual issues are way past behind us, with the remaining dispute centering on the construction of a provision of the Act, the 1996 Regulations and the interpretation to be given to the contractual documents, namely the letter of award, the EPCC Contract and the Consortium Agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We note that the appellant viewed the construction works under the EPCC Contract as a single composite transaction for levy purposes under the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We accept that the appellant is entrusted to determine the contract sum in respect of any construction works, ie after a perusal of the contract documents exchanged between the owner and the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We noted the respondent's position of certain construction works undertaken outside Malaysia, and of non-construction works such as engineering, procurement, supervision, management and other ancillary services to be excluded for calculation of the levy. We noted too of the respondent's stance that the construction works under the EPCC Contract were divisible, with only certain components being subject to levy. It was on that basis that it was willing to pay RM2,802,130.02 to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> A levy is a tax and in this case was created by the Act. It is well settled that the language of a statute imposing a tax, duty, charge or levy must be strictly construed, and with no intendment permitted. Words must be given their ordinary meaning. Nothing is to be read in, and nothing is to be implied, and once that meaning is clear due regard must be given to them. Any ambiguity detected must lean in favour of the taxpayer charged with paying the tax, duty, charge or levy (<i>Mangin v. Inland Revenue Commissioner</i> [1971] AC 739 and <i>Cape Brandy Syndicate v. Inland Revenue Commissioners</i> [1921] 1 KB 64).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The above general principles of interpreting a tax imposing statute are still woven into the fabric of the principles of construction of taxing provisions despite the introduction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">s 17A of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;17A.;;">Section 17A of the latter Act</LINK> enjoins a purposive reading to be undertaken when interpreting a statute; with such statutory backing, a literal and blinkered approach must now compete with the context and purpose of the Act as legislated by the Parliament. With a litany of cases in abundance, it is now well established that taxing statutes like all other statutes must be given a purposive interpretation to fulfill the objective of the statute, unless the circumstances demand otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In this connection, it is useful to make reference to the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_137;"><i>Palm Oil Research And Development Board Malaysia &amp; Anor v. Premium Vegetable Oils Sdn Bhd</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 137</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 97; [2004] 2 CLJ 265; [2004] 4 AMR 202 where the court spoke of the application of the <i>Ramsay</i> principle (<i>WT Ramsay Ltd v. Inland Revenue Commissioner</i> [1982] AC 300) emphasising the purposive interpretation of taxing statutes. To make it clearer, we highlight the relevant portion and it reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> It is significant to observe that the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_1;"><i>Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri Malaysia v. Alam Maritim Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2014] 2 MLJ 1; [2014] 3 CLJ 421; [2013] 6 AMR 717 endorsed the approach in the above Palm Oil Research Board case, hence settling the current interpretative position in our country. This court in <i>Alam Maritim Sdn Bhd</i> said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> To wind up the discussion under this heading, the consequential effect of the rapid economic growth in this country, and where mega projects and joint ventures by Malaysian based companies together with offshore entities are no more a rarity, makes it more imperative that the objective and purpose of the Act be implemented. This purposive and practical approach will surely assist and fulfill the task of the appellant, together with the levy mechanism to manage, develop and regulate the construction industry, tremendously.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In order to answer the leave questions posed for our determination, it naturally follows that we need to decide whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34</LINK>, upon its true construction, applies to the facts before us. And of course, we cannot but determine beforehand the details of the transaction. In <i>Barclays Mercantile Business Finance Ltd v. Mawson (Inspector of Taxes)</i> [2005] 1 AC 684, the House of Lords opined:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Whether The Construction Contract Was A Lump Sum Contract?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The letter of award dated 29 October 1999 reveals that the construction contract carried a price tag of a fixed lump sum of USD1,481,254,000.00 plus Euro 59,630,597 equivalent to RM5,867,062,431.93. In fact those were the very words used in the above letter as reproduced below. It reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Generally, under a lump sum contract, a lump sum contract price is agreed upon by parties before the works begin. In a lump sum construction contract it is a single whole construction contract as opposed to a divisible contract. <i>The Major Law Lexicon</i>, by P Ramanatha Aiyar, 4th edn, vol 4 defines a lump sum contract as a type of contract under which the contractor agrees to undertake and complete constructional works for a given price, and if the costs exceed the price, the loss is borne out by the contractor. If the extra work carried out is with the principal's approval (subject to any extra conditions) that extra cost may be recoverable. <i>(Sharpe v. San Paulo Railway Company</i> [1873] LR 8 Ch App 597 and <i>Coker v. Young</i> [1860] 2 F&amp;F 98).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> When discussing the issue of extra payments, <i>Keating on Construction Contracts</i> (9th edn) at p 105 wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Having appreciated the intricacies of a lump sum contract we now move on to scrutinise the letter of award, the EPCC Contract and the Consortium Agreement. It is obvious from the letter of award that the contract awarded to the consortium is a "fixed non-escalating lump sum Contract Price ..." (p 294 RR). Call it fixed, non-escalating or lump sum, separately or collectively, the effect is still the same, ie the contract price cannot be split up. As if to emphasise the meeting of the mind, the EPCC Contract at art 24.3 (when agreeing to the applicability of Malaysian law) stipulates that the respondent accepts the deeming provision of being aware that the contract price is lump sum based.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The issue of the lump sum contract is connected to the submission of the appellant that this was a turnkey project. By agreeing to this submission, it means that the LNG project is to be fully operational when handed over to the owner. This submission is borne out clearly in the EPCC Contract of 21 January 2000 where the following terms were agreed upon:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Perusing further the other terms of the EPCC Contract, the respondent in the recital has undertaken to complete the project in accordance with the agreement and within the specified period of time (art 2.3 at p 306 of the RR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Having sifted the relevant documents we accept the appellant's submission that the contract entered into by the owner and the respondent was a turnkey contract. The facts fall squarely under the type of contract where it is singular in purpose and at a fixed price. Suffice if we refer to <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i>, 9th edn (p 369), which explains 'turnkey contract' in this manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> We also accept the argument that the owner was never concerned with how the respondent went around completing the project. Had the owner been concerned, surely it would have participated in the Consortium Agreement of 21 January 2000. With its financial might, and with a battery of lawyers at hand, a water tight divisible contract could easily have been drafted for the owner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The documents showed that the owner's main responsibility was the prompt payment of the contract price to the contractor once the project was completed (art 6).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> We therefore hold the view that the contract awarded to the respondent by the owner is a lump sum turnkey contract and hence not divisible. This view is sufficient to answer the submission of the respondent that the levy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;34.;;">s 34 of the Act</LINK> is restricted to the construction works, which excluded non-construction works such as engineering, procurement, supervision, management, and other ancillary services. We therefore reject this submission of the respondent as reflected in paras 31 and 32 of this judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;2.;;">Section 2</LINK> ('Includes') - The Meaning Of "Construction Works" Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;2.;;">Section 2 Of The Act</LINK></p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Despite our comprehensive view as stated at para 57 above, text respondent's argument ventilated at paras 31 and 32 may also be answered in this manner. The natural starting point is by appreciating the interpretation of 'construction works'. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;2.;;">Section 2 of the Act</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The respondent argued that any works, which "form an integral part of" or "are preparatory to" the works in paras (a) to (e) of the definition, do not include offshore works or non-construction works. The respondent has relied heavily on the "noscitur a sociis" principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> We are of the view under the "noscitur a sociis" principle that it may be said that the meaning of a questionable word or phrase in a statute may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words or phrases associated with it. Apart from explaining that questionable word or phrase the accompanying words may even limit it. Abdoolcader J in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_157;"><i>Ipoh Garden Sdn Bhd v. Ismail Mahyuddin Enterprise Sdn Bhd</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 517</LINK>; [1975] 2 MLJ 241 explained it in detail in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Having perused <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_520;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> and the facts of this case, we have instead placed our reliance on the word "includes", rather than alluding to the principle of "noscitur a sociis". The word "includes" is generally used to enlarge words or phrases in a statute, as in the current Act, with those words or phrases together with those they should include, understood to have their natural meaning (Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps [1899] AC 99). Edgar Joseph Jr in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1984_1_256;"><i>PP v. Hun Peng Khai &amp; Ors &amp; Other Cases</i> [1984] 1 MLRH 256</LINK> at p 259; [1984] 2 MLJ 318; [1984] 2 CLJ 391 had occasion to remark that the word 'includes' is a word of extension and not of definition. Evans J in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1948_1_100;"><i>Loke Yung Hong v. Ng See See (F) And 3 Others</i> [1948] 1 MLRA 100</LINK>; [1948] 14 MLJ 128 opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Going by the natural meaning, we are satisfied that the engineering design procurement works, that form part of the "construction works", including all "integral and preparatory" work that will lead to a successful performance of the contract. Surely no construction works may be carried out satisfactorily without the requisite design, drawings, supervision or planning preceding it. Keating in <i>Law and Practice of Building Contracts</i> (2nd edn) at p 59 had occasion to write:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Evidentially, art 2.1 of the EPCC Contract also states that the term "Work" consists of all things to be performed and services to be rendered in connection with the realisation of the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Consortium Agreement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> We are aware, and did consider the fact that the division of responsibilities was well documented, as executed in the Consortium Agreement between the consortium partners. On the other hand we are satisfied that this division of duties was merely an internal arrangement among themselves; a clear recognition of each other's respective responsibilities. The non-involvement of the owner in this Consortium Agreement amplifies its lack of concern for the internal arrangement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Series Of Transaction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> We find merit in the appellant's submission that although a contractual transaction may involve a series of transactions it may nevertheless be a single transaction for levy purposes. Looking at the scheme in the EPCC Contract as a whole, we view the transaction as a single transaction.</p>
    <p>Implication of the respondent's agreement to pay the levies for the indivisible Contract Price (inclusive of the offshore offshore transactions and non-construction works)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In the letter of award, the respondent agreed to be made liable to the levies imposable on the Contract Price as finalised in art 8.1 of the EPCC Contract. We reproduce this article below for convenience and reference:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The Contract Price is the total 'fixed non-escalating lump sum', tagged at USD1,481,254,000 plus Euro 59,640,000 (not being divisible). The importation and reference of the whole contract sum into art 8.1 by the explicit factoring of the levy into the Contract Price convinced us that parties expected offshore transactions and non-construction works to take place. And clearly a levy was expected to be imposed on them. As these two contentious items had not escaped the attention of both parties, the respondent was deliberately made responsible for the expected levy payment. If the respondent were to be freed of the imposable levies for the offshore contracts and non-construction works, for whatever reason, surely the EPCC Contract would have made the respondent liable only to the Contract Price minus the expenditure of offshore and non-construction components. Therefore, not only did art 8.1 confirm the appellant's argument that this was an indivisible contract but the respondent also anticipated to be levied for the offshore and non-construction works component.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Extraterritoriality</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> The respondent argued that the Act applies only to Malaysia and has no extraterritorial application; no levy therefore may be imposed on works carried out outside Malaysia, ie offshore works. On the other hand the appellant canvassed that the design work and the procurement of materials though done offshore, were eventually brought into Malaysia thus creating sufficient tax presence here. We are satisfied that in the circumstances of the case, as the commercial transaction was undertaken through the respondent (contractor), a tax presence was created within Malaysia to enable a levy to be imposed. Lord Scarman in <i>Clark (Inspector of Taxes) v. Oceanic Contractors Inc</i> [1983] 2 AC 130 had occasion to clarify on the issue of tax presence in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> It must be understood that in the instant case, the levy is on the contract sum to be paid in Malaysia to the registered contractor's accounts, ie the respondent, and not to individual Consortium members. The Certificate of Registration of 28 June 2000 concertises this trading presence (see para 15 for clarification).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> For the above reasons we find substance in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant. We hold the view that the EPCC Contract is a lump sum contract and find no justification to split the contract sum into different parts, according to the work done by the individual member contractors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> The EPCC Contract is a comprehensive contract and includes both construction and non-construction components.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> We hold that the appellant has not construed the Act and the relevant documents wrongly or has imposed an incorrect levy amount on the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> For the above reasons, we allow the appellant's appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Questions 1 (i) and (iv) are to be answered in the positive whilst Questions 1 (ii) and (iii) are to be answered in the negative. As the appellant did not submit on Question 2, we refrain from answering it.</p>
