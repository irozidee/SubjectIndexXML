    <p>The three appellants in this appeal were convicted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Kidnapping Act 1961 ('the Act')</LINK>. The facts showed that the appellants had arrested and detained the victim ('SP7') and had demanded the sum of RM40,000. However, in their defence, the appellants contended that the money demanded was not for the release of SP7 from captivity, but for the settlement of a drug related matter ('kowtim' money). At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge found that the defence of the appellants did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The issues in this appeal were whether: (i) the charge was defective and not curable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>; (ii) SP7 was a confused and an inconsistent witness, thus his evidence should not be relied upon and rejected; (iii) the trial judge had erred when he concluded that the evidence of SP7 showed that he was abducted and wrongfully detained by the appellants; and (iv) the money demanded and paid was ransom money and not 'kowtim' money.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appellants' appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The appellants were jointly charged with intent to hold SP7 for ransom, wrongfully restraining (menahan) SP7 by way of abducting him (dengan cara melarikan secara salah) in furtherance of a common intention, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Act</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The charge was not defective in law as the phrase "dengan cara melarikan secara salah" was merely to explain or provide particulars of the wrongful act of "restrain" ("menahan"). The appellants were represented by learned counsel and they were neither misled nor prejudiced and no miscarriage of justice had been occasioned against the appellants. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>  Having considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution in totality, including the discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence of SP7 on a maximum basis, the trial judge found SP7's evidence to be credible and believable. The discrepancies in the evidence of SP7 were not material or crucial which required rejection of his evidence <i>in toto</i>. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b>  SP7 had been handcuffed and driven in a motorcar. SP7 was in fear and helpless. In other words, his liberty had been wrongfully restrained. Although later SP7 was not restrained, it could be seen from the evidence that he did not escape as he was under the impression that the appellants were Police Officers. Even though the handcuffs were then removed, he dared not escape, as he was in constant fear of the appellants. SP7's evidence proved that he had been kidnapped and wrongfully restrained by the appellants. (paras 22-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b>  On the issue of "kowtim" money, it is a Chinese word which means "nak settle". "Kowtim" ordinarily refers to a favour or money paid to a person in authority in return for not taking action against an offender who has committed an offence. In this case, the appellants alleged that the drugs, Eramine 5, was found in SP7's car, which he denied. However no such drugs were shown to SP7 to substantiate the appellants' allegation. No police report was lodged on the seisure of the drugs, Eramine 5. Therefore SP7 was not proved to have committed any criminal offence which warranted a settlement or "kowtim". (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In dismissing the appellants' argument of "kowtim money", the trial judge found that the money demanded by the appellants was ransom money for the release of SP7 from the appellants' captivity. It was not "kowtim money" even though SP7 referred to the money as "kowtim money", after the term was suggested to him by one of the appellants. The term "kowtim money" could not exonerate the appellants from the crime of abduction for ransom. Nothing in the definition of "ransom" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> excluded "kowtim money" from qualifying as payment of ransom. The appellants' act or conduct still fell squarely within <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Act</LINK> (<i>PP v. Selvarajah s/o Satippan (refd)</i>). (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b>  There was no merit in the argument that the 3rd appellant did not commit wrongful restraint on SP7 as he was a serving police officer who had the authority to detain a person under the law. Despite being a serving police officer, the 3rd appellant could not be clothed with authority as he and his comrades had committed the crime of abduction of SP7 for ransom in furtherance of their common intention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. Furthermore, the 1st and 2nd appellants were civilians who impersonated Police Officers. (para 31)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Jeffri Abdullah (1st appellant), Mohamad Shukri bin Ibrahim (2nd appellant) and Mat Rani bin Zakaria (3rd appellant) were jointly charged for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Kidnapping Act 1961 (the Act)</LINK>, read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The charge reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The victim was Zulkifli bin Dahalan (SP7). He hailed from Simpang 3 Sedaka, Jalan Selekoh Yan, Kedah. SP7, Rosli bin Dahalan (SP6) and Mohd Nasir bin Dahalan (SP8) are brothers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 15 March 2012, at about 5.00am, SP7 checked into Hotel Akasia at Bedong. At about 9.00am, SP7 was about to enter his Gen 2 motorcar bearing registration number PGK 1972, when he was blocked by a Honda Civic motorcar. The 2nd and 3rd appellants rushed out from the Honda Civic and forced SP7 into the Gen 2 motorcar. The 2nd appellant then handcuffed SP7's hands and pushed SP7 into the backseat of the Gen 2. The 2nd appellant drove the Gen 2, whilst the 3rd appellant entered the backseat guarding SP7. The 1st appellant was driving the Honda Civic, tailing the Gen 2 from behind.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> SP7 was taken to Klang where he was detained in a room at Hotel Istana. In the evening, SP7 made a phone call to his brother, SP6 telling SP6 that he was detained by Bukit Aman police and the kidnapper demanded a sum of RM60,000.00 for his release.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> SP6 informed about SP7's captivity to another brother, SP8 who then called the kidnapper. SP8 negotiated the amount demanded and finally he agreed to pay a reduced sum of RM40,000.00 in return for SP7's release.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Having secured the ransom money, SP8 handed it over to Insp Najhan (SP9) who recorded the particulars of the same. The money was returned to SP8. On 16 March 2012 SP8 brought the money to Kuala Lumpur with a view to hand it over to the kidnappers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> At Kuala Lumpur, SP8 went to the Shell Petrol station as directed. The said station was located after the Jalan Duta Toll Plaza. There SP8 met SP7 and the 3rd appellant in the Gen 2. SP8 handed over the money, ie RM40,000.00 to the 3rd appellant. In response, the 3rd appellant immediately released SP7.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Gen 2 was then driven northward. It stopped near the Honda Civic when the police team pounced on them. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants were apprehended. The ransom money of RM40,000.00 was found in the Gen 2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellant gave evidence on oath. All the appellants did not deny that they had arrested, detained SP7 and took SP7 to Klang and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellants too did not deny that they demanded the sum of RM40,000.00 from SP6 and SP8. But the money demanded was not for the release of SP7 from captivity, but it was for the settlement of a drug related matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants said that they had found the drugs Erimin 5 in SP7's motorcar. SP7 was threatened to be taken to Bukit Aman as he was accused of committing a drug offence. The appellants contended that they were demanding "kowtim" money and not ransom money, so that no action would be taken against SP7.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge found that the defence of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. The money demanded and paid was a ransom money and not a "kowtim" money. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants were thus convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment from the date of conviction and 10 strokes of whipping. However, the 3rd appellant was spared of the whipping as he had attained the age of 50 years at the time of conviction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Learned counsel for the 3rd appellant submitted that the charge was defective and not curable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. The charge incorporated two elements of <i>actus reus</i> namely, "menahan" (restraint) and "melarikan secara salah" (abduct). Learned counsel argued that the appellants needed to know precisely whether they were facing a charge of abduction or wrongfully restraining SP7 so that they could properly prepare their defence: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_1_168;"><i>Goh Keat Peng v. PP</i> [2001] 1 MLRH 168</LINK>; [2001] 3 MLJ 172; [2001] 2 CLJ 498. It was also submitted that the learned Judicial Commissioner has failed to critically examine the evidence of SP7, despite the learned Judicial Commissioner acknowledging that the prosecution case primarily rests on the evidence of SP7. The trial judge in his grounds of judgment at p 309 of Appeal Record vol 2 wrote as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It was further submitted that SP7 was a confused and an inconsistent witness suggesting that he was not a witness of truth. The evidence of SP7 himself showed that he was not restrained but free to move. The Court of Appeal in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2013_492;"><i>Sukhvinder Singh Naldip Singh v. PP</i> [2013] MLRAU 492</LINK>; [2014] 5 CLJ 574 had set aside the conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectionDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;3.;;">s 3 of the Act</LINK> when it was shown that the victim was indeed not restrained by the accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd appellants submitted that the learned Judicial Commissioner had erred when he concluded that the evidence of SP7 showed that he was abducted and wrongfully detained by the appellants. Further, the evidence of SP7 and the Investigating Officer, SP10 showed that the money of RM40,000.00 which was paid to the appellants was "kowtim" money and not ransom money.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Having heard the appeal, we found no merit on the grounds raised by the appellants before us. We therefore unanimously dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court. We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants were jointly charged with intent to hold SP7 for ransom, wrongfully restraining (menahan) SP7 by way of abducting him (dengan cara melarikan secara salah) in furtherance of common intention, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Act</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The charge in the instant case is not defective in law as the phrase "dengan cara melarikan secara salah" is merely to explain or provide particulars of the wrongful act of "restrain" ("menahan"). The appellants were represented by learned counsel and they were neither misled nor prejudiced and no miscarriage of justice had been occasioned against the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is undeniable that there were discrepancies and/or inconsistencies in the evidence of SP7 pertaining to whether his hands were handcuffed; whether SP7 checked-in and registered his name at Hotel Histana, Klang and whether he sent SMS to his brother, SP6 that he required RM50,000.00 or else he would be handed over to Bukit Aman. This is a question of credibility and reliability of SP7 as a prosecution witness. Learned counsel for 2nd and 3rd appellants submitted that the evidence of SP7 should not be relied and acted upon and ought to be rejected. The principle of law pertaining to assessment of a witness evidence may be seen in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_1;"><i>Lee Kwai Heong &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2006] 2 MLJ 528; [2006] 1 CLJ 1043; [2006] 3 AMR 26 wherein the Court of Appeal stated the legal principle as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Court of Appeal case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_441;"><i>Sabarudin Non v. PP &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 441</LINK>; [2005] 4 MLJ 37; [2005] 1 CLJ 466; [2005] 1 AMR 4 also addressed the issue of assessing the evidence and credibility of a witness (per Gopal Sri Ram JCA at p 444):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1976_1_562;"><i>PP v. Datuk Haji Harun Haji Idris (No 2)</i> [1976] 1 MLRH 562</LINK>; [1977] 1 MLJ 15, Raja Azlan Shah (as His Majesty then was) had this to say on witnesses discrepancies:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Having considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution in totality, including the discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence of SP7 on a maximum basis, the learned Judicial Commissioner found SP7's evidence to be credible and believable. The discrepancies in the evidence of SP7 were not material or crucial which require us to reject his evidence <i>in toto</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Now let us revisit the abduction episode to see whether SP7 was wrongfully restrained or whether he was a free man. On the day in question, SP7 was about to enter his motorcar - a Gen 2. Suddenly a Honda Civic motorcar blocked SP7 from behind. There were three persons in the Honda Civic - the 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants. The 2nd and 3rd appellants rushed out from the Honda Civic aggressively and demanded SP7 to open the door of the Gen 2. Upon opening its door, a police authority card was flashed out and SP7 was handcuffed by the 2nd appellant. The 2nd and 3rd appellants pushed SP7 into the backseat of his Gen 2. The 2nd appellant drove away the motorcar, whilst the 3rd appellant was together with SP7 at the backseat. SP7 was in fear and helpless. His hands were handcuffed. In other words, his liberty had been wrongfully restrained [see pp 57-58 of the Appeal Record vol 1].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> While in the hotel at Klang, however, SP7 was not handcuffed. He slept on the sofa and did not know what was happening. [see p 73 of the Record of Appeal vol 1]. SP7 did not run away or shouted for help as SP7 honestly believed that the appellants were police personnel. [see p 75 of the Appeal Record vol 1].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On the next day, at about 10.45am, SP7 was taken out in the car to look for "air daun ketum" (denied by SP7) and finally came to a restaurant where there were many customers in the said restaurant. SP7's hands were not in handcuff. Although he was not restrained, SP7 did not escape as he was under the impression that the appellants were Police Officers [see p 87 of the Appeal Record vol 1].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As can be seen, while at the hotel and the restaurant, though SP7 was not in handcuff, he dared not escape, as he was in constant fear of the appellants. In his judgment, the Judicial Commissioner wrote at p 312, para 24 of Appeal Record vol 2 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> On the issue of "kowtim" money, according to SP10, it was a Chinese word which means "nak settle". SP1 went on to explain "kowtim jumlah yang diminta supaya tidak diambil tindakan pada mangsa". [See p 107 of Appeal Record vol 1].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> "Kowtim" ordinarily refers to a favour or money paid to a person in authority in return for not taking action against an offender who has committed an offence. In this case, the appellants alleged that the drugs, Eramine 5 was found in SP7's car, which he denied. However no such drugs were shown to SP7 to substantiate the appellants' allegation. No police report was lodged on the seisure of the drugs, Eramine 5. Therefore SP7 was not proved to have committed any criminal offence which warranted a settlement or (kowtim).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The word "kowtim" was first suggested by one of the appellants who gave an ultimatum to SP7 whether he chose to be taken to Bukit Aman or to settle the case, which means "kowtim". SP7 was in a daze (bingung) and he echoed the word "kowtim" thereafter like a parrot. SP7 did not understand the meaning of "kowtim". The appellant requested SP7 to call his brother which he did. This evidence is recorded at p 59 of the Appeal Record vol 1 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In dismissing the appellants' argument of "kowtim money", the trial judge found that the money demanded by the appellants to SP6 and SP8 was ransom money for the release of SP7 from the appellants' captivity. It was not "kowtim money" even though SP7 referred to the money as "kowtim money", after the term was suggested to him by one of the appellants. The term "kowtim money" cannot exonerate the appellants from the crime of abduction for ransom. The trial judge wrote at p 314-315 of the Record of Appeal vol 2 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Nothing in the definition of "ransom" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> excludes kowtim money from qualifying as payment of ransom. The appellants' act or conduct still falls squarely within <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1988_365;3.;;">s 3(1) of the Act</LINK>; see <i>PP v. Selvarajah s/o Satippan</i> [2004] 3 SLR 615.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Finally we found no merit in the learned counsel for the 3rd appellant's argument that the 3rd appellant did not commit wrongful restraint on SP7 as he was a serving police officer who has the authority to detain a person under the law. Despite being a serving police officer, the 3rd appellant cannot be clothed with authority as he and his comrades had committed the crime of abduction of SP7 for ransom in furtherance of their common intention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. Furthermore, the 1st and 2nd appellants were civilians who impersonated themselves as Police Officers.</p>
