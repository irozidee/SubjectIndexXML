      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant successfully bid for a property at an auction sale in which the respondent was the chargee bank. The appellant paid the deposit sum the same day he bid for the property and subsequently paid all sums due under the auction sale. However, the property could not be transferred to the appellant as the order for sale was later set aside by the High Court on account of the respondent's non-compliance of the relevant provisions of the National Land Code and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;83.;;">O 83 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. The High Court ordered the purchase price to be fully refunded to the appellant and damages to be assessed and paid by the respondent to the chargor of the property and to the appellant. The respondent then appealed to the Court of Appeal but the appeal was dismissed. However, the Court of Appeal set aside the order for damages. The order for the refund of the purchase price to the appellant still stood. The appellant next filed a separate action against the respondent for breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The High Court dismissed the action, which decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant now appealed to the Federal Court, the question primarily being whether he was entitled to monetary compensation over and above the refunded purchase price.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was no breach of contract by the respondent. The appellant could not become the registered proprietor of the property because the order for sale was set aside. The title or interest of the property still remained with the chargor. Since there was no breach of contract on the part of the respondent, the issue of monetary compensation as claimed by the appellant did not arise. When the order for sale was declared void all that followed in its wake was equally void. Since there was no breach of contract in the first place to entitle the appellant to initiate this suit, the claim for damages by the appellant must also fail. (paras 19-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was inaction on the part of the appellant. The appellant did not pursue the matter further to the Federal Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal in setting aside the High Court order as to damages. Instead, the appellant after having received the refund of the purchase price filed a separate action against the respondent for damages. It would be unconscionable for the appellant to claim for damages now when in the first place he elected not to pursue the matter further against the order of the Court of Appeal in setting aside the High Court order for damages in his favour. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Based on the facts and the relevant laws, the appellant's claim against the respondent must fail. The appellant failed to establish that there was a breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the respondent. The whole transaction was rendered void ab initio when the order for sale was set aside. There existed no contract for sale in law. In the circumstances, the appellant was not entitled to monetary compensation over and above the refunded purchase price. (para 23)</p>

      <b>Raus Sharif PCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 4 October 2012 in affirming the judgment of the High Court in dismissing the appellant's action against the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This court on 25 March 2014 granted the appellant leave to appeal on a single question of law which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 15 February 1988, the respondent, Malayan Banking Berhad (chargee bank) as chargee of a piece of land held under Grant No 9611, Lot 26673, Mukim Kuala Lumpur ("the Property") obtained an order for sale by public auction of the Property from Kuala Lumpur High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 12 September 1990, the Deputy Registrar of the High Court conducted the sale assisted by a licensed auctioneer. The appellant successfully bid for the property at RM116,000.00. On the same day, the appellant paid a deposit in the sum of RM11,600.00 being 10% of the purchase price.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Thereafter, the appellant duly paid all sums due under the auction sale. However, the property could not be transferred to him as there was a private caveat lodged on the property on 24 September 1990 by the daughter of the chargor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 14 March 1991, the chargor of the property applied to the High Court to set aside the order for sale dated 15 February 1988, as well as the sale of the property at the auction held on 12 September 1990. The principal ground of the application was that the notice of adjourned hearing of the application for sale was not served on the chargor. The appellant had intervened and was made a party to the chargor's application to set aside the order for sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 14 June 1997, the High Court granted the orders applied by the chargor. The order for sale, as well as the sale of the property by public auction was set aside. It was also ordered that the purchase price paid to be fully refunded to the appellant and damages to be assessed and paid by the chargee bank to the chargor, as well as the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The chargee bank then appealed against the decision of High Court to the Court of Appeal. On 23 November 2002, the Court of Appeal dismissed the chargee bank's appeal. It was held that the order for sale of the property was tainted with impropriety due to the chargee bank's failure to adhere to the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code 1965 (NLC)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;83.;;">O 83 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal affirmed the order of the High Court that the purchase price paid by the appellant be refunded in full. However, the order of the High Court for damages to be assessed and paid to the chargor and the appellant was set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Aggrieved with the decision of the Court of Appeal in affirming the decision of the High Court in setting aside the order for sale and hence the sale of the property, the chargee bank applied for leave to appeal to the Federal Court. The application was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Unlike the chargee bank, the appellant did not pursue the matter further to the Federal Court. Instead on 16 December 2004, the appellant filed an action at the High Court against the chargee bank for monetary compensation, pleading breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of duties whether contractually, statutory, fiduciary or otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 23 March 2011, the High Court, Kuala Lumpur, after a full trial dismissed the appellant's action. In summary, the learned Judicial Commissioner (the trial judge) in her written judgment dated 18 June 2011, gave the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 4 October 2012, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's appeal. The Court of Appeal speaking through Clement Allan Skinner JCA held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, the appellant commenced this suit only on 16 December 2004, which was well after six years and thus in violation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6(1) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The same issues raised before the Court of Appeal were ventilated before us by the appellant. As stated earlier, the Court of Appeal held that there was no contract between the appellant and the chargee bank as the chargee bank was merely enforcing its rights as a chargee by exercising its statutory remedy against the chargor. Before us, it was submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the judges of the Court of Appeal as well as the trial judge had misdirected themselves in law with regard to the position of a chargee and a purchaser in an auction sale.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Learned counsel did not dispute the fact that the chargee bank was exercising its statutory remedy of sale as chargee of the property under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>. However, he contended that the chargee bank in exercising such powers must be regarded as the vendor in a forced sale as the chargor had abrogated his rights and powers to dispose the property in the form of a charge when he defaulted on the provision of the charge. Thus, he contended that the term 'vendor' used in the contract of sale to denote the chargee bank was not a mere term of convenience but reflected the actual capacity in which the chargee bank undertook the sale <i>vis-a-vis</i> the appellant as the purchaser.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In support of the above contention, learned counsel referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1989_3_568;"><i>Malayan United Finance Bhd, Johore Bahru v. Liew Yet Lan</i> [1989] 3 MLRH 568</LINK>; [1990] 1 MLJ 317, where VC George (as he then was) held at p 570:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was pointed out by learned counsel that the above position was endorsed by the Court of Appeal, in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_157;"><i>Mohamed Azmal Noor Naina Mohd Noor v. Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 157</LINK>; [2003] 4 MLJ 447; [2003] 2 CLJ 505; [2003] 3 AMR 265, where Abdul Aziz Mohamad JCA (as he then was) held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Learned counsel also referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_2_334;"><i>Kuala Lumpur Finance Bhd v. Yap Poh Khian &amp; Ors</i> [1991] 2 MLRH 334</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 472; [1991] 3 CLJ 75, where Lim Beng Choon J held at p 343:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In response, learned counsel for the chargee bank submitted that the so called contract between the appellant and the chargee bank was a judicial contract which emanated from the order for sale validly granted by the High Court on 15 February 1988. It was argued that since the order for sale was subsequently held to be void by the Court of Appeal the subsequent acts done pursuant to the sale were null and void. Thus, the issue of breach does not arise as there was no contract nor any term of the contract for the chargee bank to have said to be breached.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We are inclined to agree with the position taken by learned counsel for the chargee bank. In this case, it is an undisputed fact that the property could not be transferred and registered to the appellant due to the private caveat entered by the daughter of the chargor about two months prior to the appellant having paid the full purchase price. Although a certificate of sale was issued to the appellant by the court, the sale could not be completed. There was a change of circumstances. Since the certificate of sale could not be registered due to the existence of the caveat and would never be capable of being registered until the end, the title or interest of the property still remained with the chargor. Thus, the appellant could not become the registered proprietor of the property not because the chargee bank had breached the terms of the judicial contract, but because the order for sale was set aside some nine years later. Arguably, there was no breach of contract caused by either party (chargee bank and appellant Bidder) to the condition of sale. In this regard we agree with the respondent that since the order for sale was set aside, the judicial contract dated 12 September 1990 became null and void, ie no contract was struck between the respondent and the appellant, and the appellant had been put back to his original position, which means his position before the judicial contract took place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It is our judgment that since there was no breach of contract on the part of the chargee bank, the issue of monetary compensation as claimed by the appellant does not arise. As stated earlier, the order for sale was declared nine years later to be void by the High Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeal on the ground of non-compliance of the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;83.;;">O 83 of the Rules of the High Court</LINK> by the chargee bank. As rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the respondent, when the order for sale was declared void all that followed in its wake was equally void. The Court of Appeal was right in dismissing the appellant's appeal and in upholding the decision of the trial judge in dismissing the appellant's claim against the chargee bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Since it is our finding that there was no breach of contract in the first place to entitle the appellant to initiate this suit, in our considered view the claim for damages by the appellant must also fail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Another pertinent point which needs to be highlighted here is the inaction on the part of the appellant. The High Court allowed the chargor's application to set aside the order for sale on 14 June 1997. It was ordered that the purchase price be fully refunded to the appellant herein and damages to be assessed and paid by the chargee bank to the chargor and the appellant. On 23 November 2002 the chargee bank appealed to the Court of Appeal against the High Court order. The Court of Appeal dismissed the chargee bank's appeal. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court's decision in setting aside the order for sale. However, the High Court's decision in ordering that damages be assessed and paid by the chargee bank to the chargor and the appellant was set aside by the Court of Appeal. The order for the refund of the purchase price to the appellant stood. The appellant did not pursue the matter further to the Federal Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal in setting aside the High Court order as to the assessment of damages. Instead, the appellant after having received the refund of the purchase price filed a separate action against the respondent for damages. In our considered view it would be unconscionable for the appellant to claim for damages now when in the first place he elected not to pursue the matter further against the order of the Court of Appeal in setting aside the High Court order for assessment of damages in his favor. In this regard we are in agreement with the views expressed by the learned trial judge in the following passage in para 21 of the grounds of judgment which is reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> To sum up, based on the facts and the laws analysed above, it is our finding that the appellant's claim against the respondent must fail. We reiterate our earlier stand that the appellant failed to establish that there was a breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the chargee bank. The order for sale which was set aside rendered the whole transaction void <i>ab initio</i>. In law no contract for sale existed. In these circumstances, the appellant was not entitled over and above the refunded purchase price. That will be our answer to the question of law posed in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> For the above reasons, we dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
