    <p>The Industrial Court dismissed the respondent's claim for unjust dismissal against the appellant company that dismissed him for misconduct on grounds of sexual harassment. The High Court and the Court of Appeal agreed with the respondent that the Industrial Court committed procedural impropriety when it directed the complainant's evidence to be given "in camera" in the absence of the respondent. As such, the respondent's judicial review application against the Industrial Court decision was allowed. The appellant now appealed before the Federal Court. The issues were: (i) whether the respondent was accorded a fair hearing when the Industrial Court directed the complainant's evidence to be given "in camera" in the absence of the respondent notwithstanding the presence of his counsel; and (ii) whether an adverse inference should be drawn for the failure by the complainant to call witnesses whose testimonies were in the bundles of documents in the domestic inquiry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Although the respondent was not present during the cross-examination of the complainant, his counsel was present and conducted the cross-examination. There was also no objection to the portion of the proceeding heard "in camera" when directed by the Industrial Court. Applying the relevant legal principles to the facts and circumstances of the case, the Industrial Court did not breach the requirements of procedural fairness. <i>Ketua Pengarah Kastam v. Ho Kwan Seng (folld)</i>. (paras 27-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The High Court and the Court of Appeal unreasonably and unnaturally extended the principles of natural justice thereby frustrating the process of law. During the cross-examination of the complainant before the Industrial Court, counsel for the respondent was not deprived of the right to seek an adjournment to obtain any instruction from the respondent. However, no application for adjournment was made. In the circumstances, it was quite unfair to find that the Industrial Court violated the principles of natural justice on the basis of denial of procedural fairness solely because the cross-examination of the complainant was done in the absence of the respondent himself. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">Section 30(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ('Act')</LINK> should be taken into account. Also, there was no reason to conclude that the award of the Industrial Court was manifestly unreasonable or that the Industrial Court committed an error of law on the grounds of "<i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness". (paras 31-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was no merit in the respondent's complaint that the failure by the appellant to call the witnesses who testified during the domestic inquiry deprived him of the opportunity to cross-examine them. There was nothing to prevent the respondent from calling those witnesses even though the appellant did not call them. The respondent too could have objected to the production of the notes of proceedings in the domestic inquiry or the evidence adduced but did not do so. It was therefore quite unfair for the respondent to raise the issue before the High Court as if he was deprived of his right before the Industrial Court. The respondent was also present at the domestic inquiry. He heard the witnesses and was fully aware of the nature of their evidence. As such he could have applied for them to be called by the Industrial Court as witnesses under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the Act</LINK> but he did nothing except to raise the issue in his judicial review application.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Richard Malanjum CJSS:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 18 November 2013 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the appellant against the decision of the High Court made on 28 April 2010.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The High Court had allowed the judicial review application by the respondent and caused to be issued an Order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the Award made by the Industrial Court on 7 July 2008. The Industrial Court had dismissed the claim by the respondent for unjust dismissal. The High Court had also ordered that the matter be remitted to the Industrial Court for rehearing before another chairman.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal and sought for leave to appeal to this court. On 25 March 2013 leave was granted on this sole question:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 8 May 2003 the respondent was a 'paxing' crew in the appellant Flight MH 2625 from Kuching to Kuala Lumpur. Paxing crew is not on official duty but en route to another destination to report for duty. At the material time the respondent was holding the post of leading steward in the employment of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On the same flight a new assistant stewardess Chaik Mei Heng was on duty ('the complainant'). It was her first sole trip. She was assigned to assist in the Economy cabin. In her complaint to the management of the appellant made on 16 May 2003 the complainant alleged that the respondent had sexually harassed her. It resulted in a domestic inquiry being held by the appellant. There were two charges preferred against the respondent, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The Domestic Inquiry found the respondent guilty of the charges and was thus dismissed with immediate effect vide a letter from the appellant dated 18 November 2003.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Industrial Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Unhappy with his dismissal the respondent lodged his grievance with the Ministry of Human Resources Malaysia. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20(3) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ('IRA')</LINK> the Minister referred the matter to the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Industrial Court concluded that 'after analysing the evidence in total and evaluating arguments of both parties, the court finds that the claimant had committed the misconduct of sexual harassment and the act was indeed a serious affront to the dignity of any self-respecting woman like the claimant. It only deserves the severe punishment of dismissal'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Before The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In applying before the High Court for an order to quash the Award of the Industrial Court, the respondent relied on several grounds including a complaint that the Industrial Court committed procedural impropriety when it directed the complainant's evidence to be given 'in camera' and in the absence of the respondent. It was also held that adverse inference should be made for the failure by the complainant to call other witnesses although their testimonies were already in the bundles of documents of the domestic inquiry.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In granting the order of <i>certiorari</i> the High Court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Before The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In its judgment the Court of Appeal held, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It was the contention of the appellant that the main issue to be considered should be whether the 'respondent was denied of substantive and/or procedural fairness proceedings when the learned Chairman of the Industrial Court decided to conduct the proceedings "in camera", ie without the presence of the respondent in court, during the latter part of the cross-examination of the complainant but in the presence of the respondent's counsel who participated in the proceedings pursuant to the procedural ruling and cross-examined the complainant without any impediments'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was also submitted for the appellant that the answer to the issue should be in the negative for the following reasons, <i>inter alia</i>,</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In response, learned counsel for the respondent argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal were correct and that estoppel had no application. It was also contended that there was indeed procedural impropriety committed by the Industrial Court and thus a breach of natural justice to the detriment of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was further submitted that the Industrial Court erred in relying on the evidence of the complainant without calling the other witnesses and merely relying on their evidence as recorded during the Domestic Inquiry. Such approach tantamount to procedural impropriety as it had deprived the respondent the opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses and thus in breach of the rules of natural justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> At the outset it should be noted that the Court of Appeal focused its decision only on one issue and on a limited factual basis, namely, whether there was procedural impropriety in the proceedings before the Industrial Court when it allowed the cross-examination of the complainant to be heard 'in camera' without the presence of the respondent although his counsel was present and did cross-examine the complainant. In other words, whether the proceeding to allow the cross-examination of the complainant 'in camera' by counsel for the respondent but in the absence of the respondent was a procedural impropriety committed by the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Although the Court of Appeal noted that the High Court also relied on another issue in coming to its decision, namely, that the Industrial Court committed an error in law in the "<i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness" sense, it did not address that issue. It is also not an issue before us. Be that as it may, we will consider it, if we think necessary, after we have dealt with the leave question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In order to address the leave question it is appropriate to first consider <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of IRA</LINK> which stipulates thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Our courts had judicially considered the foregoing section. In essence it 'imposes a duty upon the Industrial Court to have regard to substantial merits of a case rather than to technicalities. It also requires the Industrial Court to decide a case in accordance with equity and good conscience'. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_42;"><i>Harris Solid State (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Bruno Gentil Pereira &amp; Ors</i> [1996] 1 MELR 42</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_665;">[1996] 1 MLRA 665</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 489; [1996] 4 CLJ 747; [1996] 3 AMR 3546).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Technicalities including estoppel, limitation, laches and acquiescence cannot be invoked to defeat claims that are just and proper. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1991_4_352;"><i>Nadarajah &amp; Anor v. Golf Resort (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [1991] 4 MLRH 352</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 506 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_398;"><i>Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd v. Zaid Mohd Noh</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 398</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 789; [1997] 2 CLJ 11; [1997] 1 AMR 1008).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Further, 'the Industrial Court should not be burdened with the technicalities regarding the standard of proof, the rules of evidence and procedure that are applied in the court of law.' And it should also be 'allowed to conduct its proceedings as a 'court of arbitration' and be more flexible in arriving at its decision, so long as it gives special regard to substantial merits and decide a case in accordance with equity and good conscience.' (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2002_1_4;"><i>Telekom Malaysia Kawasan Utara v. Krishnan Kutty Sanguni Nair &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MELR 4</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_188;">[2002] 1 MLRA 188</LINK>; [2002] 3 MLJ 129; [2002] 3 CLJ 314; [2002] 3 AMR 2898).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> However, despite the wide discretionary powers given to the Industrial Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of IRA</LINK> it should not be assumed that it could conduct its proceedings in any manner and according to its own whims and fancies. The Industrial Court is required to observe the rules of natural justice, in particular to observe procedural fairness and to avoid procedural impropriety. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2010_1_12;"><i>Jebsen &amp; Jessen Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd v. David Sandanasamy &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 1 MELR 12</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_816;">[2010] 1 MLRA 816</LINK>; [2010] 5 MLJ 628; [2010] 3 ILR 457; [2010] 6 CLJ 911).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In this case the High Court and the Court of Appeal agreed with the respondent that the Industrial Court committed procedural impropriety when making its Award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Now, procedural impropriety is said to have occurred when a decision maker (including an administrative tribunal or an arbiter) empowered by public law in the form of legislation or common law (that is, prerogative power), in coming to a decision (including his refusal to make a decision) with consequences affecting 'some person or (body of persons)', fails:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The basic rules of natural justice are generally understood to mean the right to be heard, the rule against bias and the duty to act fairly. However the scope of the 'duty to act fairly' should be considered on a case to case basis depending on the facts and circumstances governing the relationship of those involved prior to the decision being made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As regards procedural fairness it encompasses the procedures used by a decision maker and not so much the actual decision itself. Ordinarily, procedural fairness requires a hearing that is appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the matter, the absence of bias, the availability of evidence and an inquiry into the issue before a decision is made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1975_1_586;"><i>Ketua Pengarah Kastam v. Ho Kwan Seng</i> [1975] 1 MLRA 586</LINK>; [1977] 2 MLJ 152 at p 588 Raja Azlan Shah FCJ (as His Majesty then was) said this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Applying therefore the above legal principles to the facts and circumstances of this case while bearing in mind the complaint of the respondent as accepted by the courts below, we find that as a whole the Industrial Court did not breach the requirements of procedural fairness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> No doubt the respondent was not present during the cross-examination of the complainant. However, his counsel was present and conducted the cross-examination. There was also no objection when the Industrial Court ruled that that portion of the proceeding should be heard 'in camera'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is important to bear in mind that the principles of natural justice should not be 'unreasonably and unnaturally extended so as to frustrate the process of law'. It would suffice to a large extent if the essential elements of the principles are followed, namely, that there must be absence of bias or even appearance of bias, that there must be scope for a fair hearing and that irrelevant materials must not be taken into account. Of course fair hearing could very well be claimed in connection with a right, interest or legitimate expectation. (See: "<i>Lord Denning - The Judge and the Law</i>" edited by JL Jowell and JPWB McAuslan).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> With respect we find in this case that the High Court and the Court of Appeal had indeed 'unreasonably and unnaturally extended so as to frustrate the process of law' the principles of natural justice. During the cross-examination of the complainant before the Industrial Court learned counsel for the respondent was never deprived of the right to seek for adjournment to obtain any instruction from the respondent. There was no such application for adjournment in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We therefore find that on the facts and circumstances of this case it is quite unfair to say now that the Industrial Court violated the principles of natural justice on the basis of denial of procedural fairness, just because the cross-examination of the complainant was done in the absence of the respondent personally. As indicated above <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the IRA</LINK> should also be taken into account or else it would be otiose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Accordingly, the appellant is justified in its complaint as adumbrated above. We are therefore inclined to answer the leave question in the negative and allow this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> However, there is one more issue that is not the subject of the leave question. The issue is whether it could be said that the Industrial Court had also committed an error in law in the "<i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness" sense.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We are well aware that the parties did not argue this issue before us. But on the facts and circumstances of this case it should not bar us from considering it in order to finally determine this case and to save costs and time. (See: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_71;"><i>R Rama Chandran v. Industrial Court Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 1 MELR 71</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_725;">[1996] 1 MLRA 725</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 145; [1997] 1 CLJ 147; [1997] 1 AMR 433).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Thus, having considered the complaint of the respondent related to this issue we are of the view that our answer to the leave question has answered this issue as well.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Further, in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1990_1_34;"><i>Harpers Trading (M) Sdn Bhd v. National Union Of Commercial Workers</i> [1990] 1 MELR 34</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_536;">[1990] 1 MLRA 536</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 417; [1991] 1 CLJ (Rep) 159, Jemuri Serjan SCJ (as he then was) observed thus:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Indeed a decision would also be considered manifestly unreasonable if no body of persons could have reached it. But in order to come to such conclusion there must be overwhelming evidence to support it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Accordingly, in this case on the facts and circumstances as found by the Industrial Court based on the evidence adduced, we find no reason to conclude that the Award of the Industrial Court was manifestly unreasonable or that the Industrial Court had committed an error of law in the "<i>Wednesbury</i> unreasonableness" sense.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We also find no merit in the complaint of the respondent that the failure by the appellant to call the witnesses who testified during the Domestic Inquiry had deprived him of the opportunity to cross-examine them. There was nothing to prevent the respondent from calling those witnesses even though the appellant did not call them. Obviously the appellant was satisfied with the evidence it had adduced without having to call those witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Further, the respondent could have objected to the production of the notes of proceeding of the Domestic Inquiry or the evidence adduced. He did not do so. It was therefore quite unfair for the respondent to raise such an issue before the High Court as though he was deprived of his right before the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We would go further to say that the respondent was present at the Domestic Inquiry. He heard the witnesses and was therefore fully aware of the nature of their evidence. As such he could have applied for them to be called by the Industrial Court as witnesses in exercise of its power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) of the IRA</LINK>. He did nothing except to raise such an issue in his judicial review application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As such even the second ground given by the High Court in allowing the application of the respondent has no basis for the foregoing reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Accordingly, we allow this appeal with costs. We set aside the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The Award of the Industrial Court is hereby restored.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
