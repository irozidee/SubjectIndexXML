    <p>The respondents as plaintiffs had filed a claim for damages arising from a road accident between the 1st respondent's motorcycle and the appellant's motorcar. The 1st respondent was the rider of the motorcycle whilst the 2nd respondent was the pillion rider. The Sessions Judge, having found the 1st respondent 70% liable and the appellant 30% liable to the 2nd respondent, dismissed the appellant's counterclaim for contribution against the 1st respondent which was based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;10.;;">s 10(1)(c) Civil Law Act 1956 ('CLA')</LINK>. The appellant then appealed to the High Court, which appeal was dismissed. Hence, the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In light of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;10.;;">s 10 CLA </LINK>and the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Malaysia National Insurance Sdn Bhd v. Lim Tiok</i>, the appellant was entitled to pursue his rights of contribution or indemnity against the 1st respondent up to 70% of damages awarded against the 2nd respondent. The quantum of damages was not disputed. Therefore, the learned judge erred in law in dismissing the counterclaim of the appellant. In a case of an action of contribution, the appellant was entitled to rely on the quantum of damages already assessed and not in dispute and could proceed to claim for contribution based on the ratio of liability already ordered by the court. There would be no necessity for any evidence to be led in that regard. (paras 7-9)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the High Court dismissing the appellant's appeal on 5 October 2011. For ease of reference, we will refer to the appellant as the defendant and the 1st and 2nd respondents as the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts Relevant To This Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs filed a claim for damages arising from a road accident which occurred on 8 April 2002 at KM196.5 Jalan Johor Bahru- Kuantan between the 1st plaintiff's motorcycle Registration No CAH 4370 and the defendant's Motorcar Registration No BDR 9715. The 1st plaintiff was the rider of the motorcycle and the 2nd plaintiff was seated as the pillion rider. The defendant was the driver of the motorcar.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The defendant filed an amended defence and counterclaim against the 1st plaintiff and <i>inter alia</i> sought to counterclaim from the 1st plaintiff the damages to the extent of the 1st plaintiff contribution in the accident payable to the 2nd plaintiff who was the pillion rider. After a full trial, the learned Sessions Court Judge decided and apportioned liability as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The defendant had filed a counterclaim based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;10.;;">s 10</LINK> and in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;10.;;">subsection 10(1)(c) of the Civil Law Act 1956 (Act 67)</LINK> and the learned Sessions Court Judge dismissed the counterclaim of the defendant. The learned High Court Judge on 5 October 2011 also dismissed the defendant's appeal (See the order at pp 4-5 Appeal Record Part A). Hence, the defendant filed this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The defendant has abandoned its grounds of appeal in the Memorandum of Appeal (see at pp 1-3 Appeal Record Part A), save and except for Grounds 1 and 2 which are essentially on the dismissal of the counterclaim. The defendant adopted the procedure set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;16.;;">O 16 r 8(1)(a) of Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> to claim a contribution and/or indemnity against the 1st plaintiff. This procedure had been set out in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_551;"><i>Chan Kit Hong &amp; Anor v. Jayakumar M Kuppusamy &amp; Anor</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 551</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The finding of liability in this case stemmed from the ruling of the Sessions Court that the 1st plaintiff was 70% liable to the 2nd plaintiff and the defendant was 30% liable. The defendant now appeals against the refusal of the High Court Judge to allow a plea of contribution or indemnity wherein the defendant seeks 70% contribution in term of damages that the defendant has to pay out to the 2nd plaintiff from the 1st plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> This is not a claim for apportionment of liability but a claim for contribution from the 1st plaintiff who is a joint tortfeasor. We now set out <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;10.;;">s 10 of the Act 67</LINK> in full:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[8] The court also refers to the decision of Supreme Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_43;"><i>Malaysia National Insurance Sdn Bhd v. Lim Tiok</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 43</LINK> in which the facts of the case are very similar to ours. We refer to the judgment of His Lordship Edgar Joseph Jr at p 56 of the report which we now set out:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In the light of that, it is our finding that the defendant in this case is entitled to pursue its rights of contribution or indemnity against the 1st plaintiff up to 70% of damages awarded against the 2nd plaintiff. The quantum of damages is not being disputed, we therefore are of the view the learned judge erred in law in dismissing the counterclaim of the defendant. In a case of an action of contribution, the appellant is entitled to rely on the quantum of damages already assessed and not in dispute and proceed to claim for contribution based on the ratio of liability already ordered by the court. There would be no necessity for any evidence to be led in this regard.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the upshot, the appeal is allowed purely in relation to the first and second grounds of the Memorandum of Appeal and the order of the High Court is set aside to that extent with costs.</p>
