    <p>The appellant had charged her land under two charges ("the land") in favour of the respondent as security for two loans. She defaulted and the respondent attempted to sell the land by public auction through the Land administrator but was unsuccessful. The Land administrator, acting under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265(3)(b) of the National Land Code 1965 ("NLC")</LINK>, issued a Certifiate of Reference to the respondent allowing it to refer the matter to the High Court and apply for the substitution of the Land administrator's order with an order for sale under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the NLC</LINK>. The respondent later fied Originating Summons No: 21-129-2002 in the High Court at Kuantan, Pahang ("the original action") seeking an order for the sale of the land to recover the outstanding loans under the said charges. On 23 June 2003, the respondent obtained from the High Court a judgment-in-default of appearance against the appellant and an order for sale of the land by way of a public auction fied for 15 October 2003. On 8 April 2005, the appellant fied a summons in chambers ("SIC") seeking <i>inter alia</i>, to set aside: (i) the order for sale dated 23 June 2003; (ii) the service of the Summons for Direction dated 28 June 2003 on the appellant; and (iv) service of the Originating Summons. The appellant's SIC was dismissed by the High Court on 11 September 2006 and her appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed on 22 June 2010. An application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;24.;;">O 24 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ("RHC")</LINK> for discovery of documents relating to the order for the substituted service in respect of the original action was also dismissed by the High Court on 30 March 2011 and such decision was affimed by the Court of Appeal on 29 October 2012. The appellant did not pursue an appeal in the Federal Court. However, on 23 August 2010, the appellant fied Originating Summons 24-205-2010 ("the instant action") to <i>inter alia</i>, set aside: (a) the substituted service of the Originating Summons in the original action; (b) the service of the notice of appointment to hear the Originating Summons No: 24-129-2002; (c) the order given on the Summons for Directions; and further to declare the sale of public auction on 30 March 2005 not valid and void. The instant action was dismissed by the High Court on 30 March 2013. The High Court also dismissed the appellant's application and the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. According to the High Court, the instant action was similar to the application made by way of the SIC which was dismissed by the High Court on 11 September 2006. The decision essentially showed that it was not appropriate for the appellant to fie a similar application as all issues had already been fully ventilated and determined. Accordingly, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> applied and the appellant was estopped from fiing the instant action. The issue before the Court of Appeal was thus based on the application of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> and estoppel to the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <i>Res judicata</i> means a matter adjudged. Its signifiance lies in its effect of creating an <i>estoppel</i> per <i>rem judicatam</i>. The <i>res judicata</i> rule dictates that when a matter between two parties has been adjudicated by a court, the matter may not be pursued further by the same parties because the judgment becomes the truth between such parties. Its application produces fiality in litigation and one ought not to be vexed twice for the same cause of action. Since <i>res judicata</i> creates an <i>estoppel</i> per <i>rem judicatam</i>, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> is really the doctrine of <i>estoppel</i> per <i>rem judicatam</i>. (para 11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> comprises two distinct forms of <i>estoppel</i> that is to say, cause of action <i>estoppel</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i>. Cause of action <i>estoppel</i> is confied to cases where the cause of action and the parties are the same in the second suit as they were in the fist suit in which case the bar is absolute. Issue <i>estoppel</i> involves going over precisely the same issue or point already decided in the fist action or refer to an issue that has been previously litigated and determined between the parties and the same issue is raised in a subsequent proceeding between the parties involving a different cause of action to which the same issue is relevant and one of the parties seek to reopen the issue. In such situation relitigating those same issues in a civil action is precluded. In short, issue <i>estoppel</i> prevents contradiction of a previous determination, whereas cause of action <i>estoppel</i> prevents reassertion of the cause of action. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Although the appellant contended that the hearing of the SIC in the original action was not disposed of on the specifi ground of substituted service, the appellant in that application had specifially sought to set aside the service of both the Originating Summons and the Summons for Directions when the service of such legal process was effected by way of the substituted service. Thus when the appellant sought through her SIC to set aside the service of the Originating Summons and the Summons for Directions, she was in effect seeking to set aside the substituted service of the originating process. The respondent had addressed the issue in its affiavit-in-reply and the judge when dismissing the SIC had considered the issue and had decided that the service of the legal process was good as it was effected by way of substituted service. The Court of Appeal had also affimed the decision of the High Court judge. Further, in dismissing the appellant's application, the judge relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;24.;;">O 24 r 4(1) of the RHC</LINK>, had held that the issue of <i>res judicata</i> and <i>estoppel</i> should be determined before the appellant made any discovery of documents. The decision was affimed by the Court of Appeal on 29 October 2012. This court was not persuaded by the appellant's persistent argument that despite the issue having been fully ventilated twice in the previous applications during the hearing of the fist instance and during the appeal, the application was wrongly and perversely refused by the court. (paras 15-16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> All the appellant's applications were ultimately aimed at setting aside the order for sale of the land and to thwart the respondent's action from accomplishing the sale. In the instant action, the court was made to go over precisely the same issue or point which had already been fully litigated by the parties in the SIC of the original action as well as the application for discovery. This was, without doubt, an attempt to reopen or re-litigate the issue which was indubitably vexatious and extremely galling. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Reliance on the plea of <i>res judicata</i> and <i>estoppel</i> justifid and the doctrine applied to bar the appellant from relitigating the issue in the instant action. It was patently clear that through the instant action the appellant sought to set aside the service of the original action and the order for sale of the land for the second time, an obvious attempt at a 'second' bite of the cherry. The appellant could not as a matter of law raise the issue again. It would be most unjust to do so as this would undoubtedly amount to an abuse of the process of the court. <i>Everise Hectares Sdn Bhd v. Citibank Bhd</i> (refd). (para 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Even if the purported impeachment of the order for the substituted service of the original action was not, as contended by the appellant, the issue ventilated in the SIC, the appellant should have or could have done so in the original action. The plea of <i>res judicata</i> in its amplifid and wider sense was also available to the respondent to bar the appellant from mounting a legal challenge in the instant action raising the issue which she should or could have raised in the earlier proceedings but did not and to prevent an abuse of the process of the court. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> If the plea of <i>res judicata</i> was not applicable, the instant action should be treated as a fresh application with a completely new cause of action and issue. The appellant would then be guilty of extreme laches for waiting more than seven years to sue the respondent. The relevant date that should be the applicable date in determining whether laches would apply was 23 June 2003, when the judgment in default of appearance was obtained against the appellant. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Laches when asserted in litigation, is an equitable defence and failure to pursue one's right timeously and with suffiient promptitude may attract the application of laches which operates to deny such right to the claimant. In the instant appeal, the appellant had been extremely remiss in allowing a considerable and unreasonable delay in commencing the instant action. The appellant had slept on her rights and chose to do nothing despite knowing that various actions had been taken by the respondent. The appellant had waited too long to bring the instant action and she should not be permitted to seek the remedy as the delay had prejudiced the respondent. There must be an end to litigation. The appellant had failed to give a reasonable explanation as regards her extreme delay in fiing the instant action and accordingly the appellant was guilty of laches after a slumber of seven years. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> In the instant case, the substituted service effected by way of the advertisement was effective and suffiient service to bring the original action to the notice of the appellant. There was no evidence to show that the service of the original action was irregular and the appellant had accordingly failed to discharge the burden of proving that the service was irregular. (para 25)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Idrus Harun JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 25 January 1992 the appellant, the owner of a piece of land held under GM 5157 Lot 7239, Mukim of Chukai, Kemaman, Terengganu, created fist and second charges over the said land in favour of the respondent for two loans it had advanced to her in the sums of RM90,000.00 and RM60,000.00 respectively. The appellant however, had defaulted and by 26 June 2002 the total amount she owed the respondent stood at RM464,072.39.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Following the default, the Land administrator for the District of Kemaman had, on 18 July 1999, ordered for the land to be sold by public auction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Two public auctions were held on 18 April 2001 and 19 September 2001, however it was not successful as there were no bidders. As such, the Land administrator, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;265.;;">s 265(3)(b) of the National Land Code</LINK>, issued a Certifiate of Reference to the respondent allowing it to refer the matter to the court and apply for the substitution of the Land administrator's order with an order for sale under s 256 thereof. On 24 July 2002, the respondent fied an Originating Summons No: 21-129-2002 in the High Court at Kuantan, Pahang (the original action) seeking an order for the sale of the land in order to recover the outstanding loans under the said charges.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Subsequently, a judgment in default of appearance in respect of the Originating Summons was entered on 23 June 2003, wherein the High Court granted the order for the sale of the land by way of a public auction fied for 15 October 2003.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Consequent to the said judgment, the appellant fied a summons in chambers on 8 April 2005 seeking the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The summons in chambers was dismissed by High Court Judge Abd Halim Aman J on 11 September 2006. The appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 22 June 2010 but she did not fie for leave to appeal to the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Instead, on 23 August 2010 the appellant fied an Originating Summons No: 24-205-2010 (the instant action) seeking the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The instant action was dismissed by High Court Judge Mariana Yahya J ('the learned judge') on 11 March 2013. The appellant thereupon appealed against the said decision to this court which is the instant appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It is important to mention briefl at this point that the main and only ground upon which the decision was arrived at in dismissing the appellant's application in the instant action was premised on the application of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>. According to the learned judge, the instant action was similar to the application made by way of the summons in chambers which was dismissed by the High Court on 11 September 2006. The decision essentially shows that it was not appropriate for the appellant to fie a similar application as all issues had already been fully ventilated and determined. Accordingly, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> applied and the appellant was <i>estopped</i> from fiing the instant action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant's arguments before us primarily concerned the issue of the service of the original action on the appellant. Central to the issue was the assertion that the substituted service of the original action by the respondent to the appellant was not substantiated and proved. Consequently, for the appellant it was submitted that the purported order for sale given by the High Court pursuant to the judgment in default of appearance on 23 June 2003 ought to be set aside ex debito justitiae.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> However, the respondent, in answer to the appellant's argument as regards the above issue, raised the question associated with the application of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> and <i>estoppel</i> to the appeal before this court contending that if the learned judge correctly considered the said doctrine, this appeal should fail in toto. This argument, seen in light of the issues litigated and adjudicated by the High Court in the summons in chambers application, got us ruminating on the question of the plea of <i>res judicata</i> fist in view of its importance, the answer to which we think will ultimately determine this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is settled in the authorities that <i>res judicata</i> simply means a matter adjudged, and its signifiance lies in its effect of creating an <i>estoppel</i> per rem judicatam. The <i>res judicata</i> rule dictates that when a matter between two parties has been adjudicated by a court, the matter may not be pursued further by the same parties because the judgment becomes the truth between such parties, its application produces fiality in litigation and one ought not to be vexed twice for the same cause of action. Since <i>res judicata</i> creates an <i>estoppel</i> per <i>rem judicatam</i>, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> is really the doctrine of <i>estoppel</i> per <i>rem judicatam</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The plea of <i>res judicata</i> has been amplifid further when it is said that the doctrine comprises two distinct forms of <i>estoppel</i> that is to say, cause of action <i>estoppel</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i>. Cause of action <i>estoppel</i> is confied to cases where the cause of action and the parties are the same in the second suit as they were in the fist suit in which case the bar is absolute. On the other hand, issue <i>estoppel</i> would involve going over precisely the same issue or point already decided in the fist action or refer to an issue that has been previously litigated and determined between the parties and the same issue is raised in a subsequent proceeding between the parties involving a different cause of action to which the same issue is relevant and one of the parties seek to reopen the issue. In such situation relitigating those same issues in a civil action is precluded. In short, issue <i>estoppel</i> prevents contradiction of a previous determination, whereas cause of action <i>estoppel</i> prevents reassertion of the cause of action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In setting out the above fundamental principles governing this doctrine, we are merely echoing the various judicial pronouncements made thereon in the following cases of <i>North West Water Ltd v. Binnie &amp; Partners (a fim)</i> [1990] 3 All ER 548, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_84;"><i>OCBC Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v. Kredin Sdn Bhd</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 84</LINK>; [1997] 2 MLJ 544; [1997] 2 CLJ 534, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_611;"><i>Asia Commercial Finance (M) Berhad v. Kawal Teliti Sdn Bhd</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 611</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 189; [1995] 3 CLJ 783; [1995] 3 AMR 2559, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_7_335;"><i>Seruan Gemilang Makmur Sdn Bhd v. Badan Perhubungan Umno Negeri Pahang Darul Makmur</i> [2009] 7 MLRH 335</LINK>; [2010] 8 MLJ 57 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_2_159;"><i>Chemfert Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Lim Hua</i> [2010] 2 MLRA 159</LINK>; [2010] 5 MLJ 228; [2010] 7 CLJ 491.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Having stated the law on the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, we shall now turn to consider the nature of the claims in both the original action and the instant action and thus whether the doctrine can be applied to the present appeal. As we have mentioned a moment ago, as regards the original action, the respondent had obtained the judgment in default of appearance which allowed the respondent to recover the outstanding loans under the two charges by way of an order for the sale of the subject land. However, the appellant applied by way of the summons in chambers seeking amongst others, the setting aside of the order for sale dated 23 June 2003, the service of Summons for Directions dated 28 June 2003 on the defendant, the service of the original action on the defendant and the public auction on 30 March 2005. The application was dismissed by the High Court and the appellant's appeal against the said dismissal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant subsequently fied the instant action before the High Court seeking reliefs which we have no hesitation in holding were strikingly similar to the above-mentioned reliefs and these were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the hearing of the summons in chambers was not disposed of on the specifi ground of substituted service. We should say, in this regard, that the appellant in her application <i>vide</i> the summons in chambers specifially sought to set aside the service of both the Originating Summons and the Summons for Directions and the evidence shows that the service of this legal process was effected by way of the substituted service. Thus, when the appellant sought to set aside the service of the Originating Summons and the Summons for Directions, she was in effect seeking to set aside the substituted service of the originating process. In fact, in her affiavit in support, the appellant had averred that the Originating Summons and the Summons for Directions were served at a wrong address. The respondent moreover had also addressed the issue of the substituted service in its affiavit in reply and additionally the appellant's previous solicitors, fully aware of this issue, had replied on the same in the submission. The learned judge, it is to be observed, in dismissing the summons in chambers had considered this issue and decided that the service of the legal process was good as it was effected by way of the substituted service. When the matter was heard on appeal, the Court of Appeal affimed the decision of the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> However, the case did not end with the Court of Appeal's decision when the appellant, on 27 January 2011, had applied pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;24.;;">O 24 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> for discovery of documents relating to the order for the substituted service in respect of the original action. The application was dismissed by the High Court on 30 March 2011. Relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;24.;;">O 24 r 4(1) of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>, the learned judge held that the issue of <i>res judicata</i> and <i>estoppel</i> should be determined before any discovery of documents was made by the appellant. The application, according to the learned judge, was an abuse of the court process. Once again, the decision was affimed by the Court of Appeal on 29 October 2012. Therefore, we are not persuaded by the appellant's persistent argument through her learned counsel that, despite the issue having been fully ventilated twice in the previous applications during the hearing of the fist instance and during the appeal, the application was wrongly and perversely refused by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant sought to justify the fiing of the instant action by contending that the same was fied for the impeachment of the order of the substituted service of the original action. Whatever explanation or justifiation there may be in such a case, in our judgment, all these applications, whether it sought to set aside the service of the Originating Summons or it was under the guise of impeaching the order of the substituted service, were ultimately aimed at setting aside the order for sale of the subject land and to thwart the respondent's action from accomplishing the sale. Clearly in the instant action, the court was made to go over precisely the same issue or point which had already been fully litigated by the parties in the summons in chambers of the original action as well as the application for discovery. This is without doubt, an attempt to reopen or re-litigate the issue which to our mind is indubitably vexatious and extremely galling.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is plainly true that both the original and instant actions, in essence, seek to set aside the order for sale of the subject land and indeed the appellant's challenge in both actions on the service of the Originating Summons in the original action would undeniably, if successful, have the effect of setting aside the said order for sale as well. There were no other reasons that the appellant relied on in order to set aside the said order for sale. The instant action manifestly involved the same cause of action and issues which had already been fully litigated and decided upon previously by the court in the original action. That being so, in our judgment, reliance on the plea of <i>res judicata</i> and <i>estoppel</i> is without any question justifid and the doctrine applies to bar the appellant from relitigating the issue in the instant action. It is patently clear that through the instant action the appellant sought to set aside the service of the original action and the order for sale of the land for the second time, an obvious attempt at a 'second' bite of the cherry. The appellant could not as a matter of law raise this issue again (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_306;"><i>Everise Hectares Sdn Bhd v. Citibank Bhd</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 306</LINK>; [2011] 2 CLJ 25). Therefore it would be most unjust to do so as this would undoubtedly amount to an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We would further add that even if the purported impeachment of the order for the substituted service of the original action was not, as contended by learned counsel for the appellant, the issue ventilated in the Summons In Chambers, the appellant in our view should have or could have done so in the previous original action. The plea of <i>res judicata</i> in its amplifid and wider sense is also available to the respondent to bar the appellant from mounting a legal challenge in the instant action raising the issue which she should or could have raised in the earlier proceedings but did not and to prevent an abuse of the process of the court. We would in this regard refer to the Supreme Court decision in Superintendent Of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_131;"><i>Superintendent Of Pudu Prison &amp; Ors v. Sim Kie Chon</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 131</LINK>; [1986] 1 MLJ 494; [1986] CLJ (Rep) 256 which succinctly explained the doctrine in its wider sense as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The doctrine was further elucidated by the Supreme Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_611;"><i>Asia Commercial Finance (M) Berhad v. Kawal Teliti Sdn Bhd</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 611</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 189; [1995] 3 CLJ 783; [1995] 3 AMR 2559 wherein Peh Swee Chin FCJ writing the judgment of the court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The appeal before us primarily turned on the critical issue of <i>res judicata</i> and our decision in applying this doctrine to the instant action would be suffiient to dispose of this appeal. Despite our fiding however, we feel compelled and appropriate to move on to delve into other relevant issues if the doctrine is not applicable to the instant action. One pertinent point which was raised by the respondent was that the appellant was guilty of extreme laches if the plea of <i>res judicata</i> failed adding that the instant action could be deemed a new application fied by the appellant after 11 years following the date of the fist order for sale by the Land administrator on 18 July 1999, or seven years, as admitted by the appellant. We agree that if the plea of <i>res judicata</i> should fail, the instant action should be treated as a fresh application with a completely new cause of action and issue. In our view however the relevant date which should be the applicable date in determining whether laches would apply as a defence is 23 June 2003 when the judgment in default of appearance was obtained against the appellant. This is because the new issue for determination was the order for the substituted service which relates to the said judgment in default of appearance. Thus there was clearly a delay of seven years and it was a bit too long for the respondent to wait to be sued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Laches when asserted in litigation, is an equitable defence and failure to pursue one's right timeously and with suffiient promptitude may attract the application of laches which operates to deny such right to the claimant. In this appeal, the appellant had been extremely remiss in allowing a considerable and unreasonable delay in commencing the instant action. Obviously the appellant had slept on her rights and chose to do nothing despite knowing that various actions had been taken by the respondent. The appellant had waited too long to bring the instant action and in our judgment, she should not be permitted to seek the remedy as the delay had prejudiced the respondent. There must be an end to litigation (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_3_723;"><i>YAM Tengku Ali Ibni Almarhum Sultan Sulaiman v. Kerajaan Negeri Terengganu Darul Iman</i> [1995] 3 MLRH 723</LINK>; [1996] 4 MLJ 374; [1996] 1 CLJ 649). The claim obviously is bad for laches. We agree with learned counsel for the respondent that the appellant had failed to give a reasonable explanation as regards her extreme delay in fiing the instant action and accordingly the appellant was guilty of laches after a slumber of seven years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The main issue put forward by the appellant in the memorandum of appeal was that the learned judge had based on her own belief, refused and failed to evaluate evidence in dismissing the summons in chambers and that the respondent did not adduce evidence with respect to the service of the original action. The appellant alleged that the respondent had failed to serve the original action at the address given in the memorandum of charges which was No: 2992, Taman Sri Jakar, Jalan Feri Lama, Kemaman, Terengganu. Instead, the original action was served on the wrong address which was No 2929, Taman Sri Jakar, Jalan Feri Lama, Kemaman, Terengganu. In consequence, the respondent was unable to effect the personal service of the legal process on the appellant. We need only say on this aspect that the respondent indeed had admitted that there were attempts to serve the original action on the appellant at the above-mentioned incorrect address and not at No 2992 given in the memorandum of charges. However, notwithstanding the admission, the respondent's immediate reposte was that, this had not prejudiced the appellant as she did not reside at the said address but at all material times she resided at Lot 271 B2, Taman AST, 70200 Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. The offiial search showed that the appellant resided at the said address since 10 July 1998. The original action was fied on 24 July 2002. As personal service at the offiial address was unsuccessful, the order for substituted service of the original action was obtained and the said order was advertised with the offiial address and the incorrect address, the appellant's name and a new and old identity card numbers stated therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We are mindful of the fact that cl 40 of the memorandum of charges provides that the service of any legal process may be given by prepaid registered or ordinary post sent to the respective Address for Service of the parties and such legal process shall be deemed to have been duly served after the expiration of fie days from the date it is posted. We pause to observe at this point that the expression "address for service" is not defied in the memorandum of charges at all nor does the memorandum of charges provide for address for service of the parties and herein lies the diffiulty. Indeed, the omission to defie the term has raised an important question of whether we can consider and accept the address stated in the memorandum of charges as the address for service? It would appear to be so, however, the term 'Legal Process' in cl 40 is defied in cl 36(6) in the memorandum of charges as "pleadings, all forms of originating processes ... notices required to be given to the other under the security" and there is moreover cl 2 which provides that any demand for payment may be made by a notice ... and such notice shall be deemed to have been suffiiently served on the chargor if it is left at the usual or last known place of residence or at the address above stated of the chargor or at the usual or last known place of business of the chargor or sent by registered letter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Thus while the defiition of the term "Legal Process" includes notice in cl 2 of the memorandum of charges and the service of such notice under the said clause can be effected at any address stated therein, the service of Legal Process which includes a notice in cl 40 thereof on the other hand can be effected only at the Address for Service but the memorandum of charges has omitted to defie the term nor provide for the Address of Service of the parties. The clauses, with its attendant ambiguity, uncertainty and contradictions, have caused diffiulty in construing it. We are of the view that in construing these clauses in particular cl 40, a liberal approach should be adopted by giving a reasonable construction to it, having regard to the surrounding circumstances. The memorandum of charges should be given a reasonable business meaning and should not be construed so as to render it ineffective, contradictory or illusory (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_658;"><i>Amanah Merchant Bank Bhd v. Lim Tow Choon (Through Offiial Assignee)</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 658</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 413; [1994] 2 CLJ 1). Thus taking into account the fact that service of process serves to give notice to the defendant of the proceedings and to command him to either respond to the process or to appear at any specifid time and answer the claim, the proper meaning, in the context of clss 40, 36(6) and 2 of the memorandum of charges, the court ought to give is that as long as the originating process of the original action was brought to the notice of the appellant, the substituted service at the last known address of the appellant was proper and regular. The offiial address mentioned in the advertisement was in our judgment correct as it could be considered as the last known place of residence or address of the appellant. In giving such interpretation we also take into account the fact that the term 'Address of Service' is not defied in cl 40 or elsewhere in the memorandum of charges and that cl 36(6) thereof allows service at the last known place of residence or address of the appellant quite apart from the address stated in the memorandum of charges. Accordingly the deeming provision in cl 40 of the memorandum applied to the substituted service of the originating process of the original action and we come to the inevitable fiding that the original action was duly served on the appellant (see <i>Amanah Merchant Bank Bhd v. Lim Tow Choon (Through Official Assignee) (supra)</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the appellant's affiavit in respect of the original action, the appellant stated that she was informed by somebody that her property had been fied for auction. Her solicitor had also replied on the issue of the substituted service order in the submission. In any event the learned judge in dealing with this issue had made a fiding that following the advertisement of the order for substituted service, Messrs Ghulam Development and Construction Sdn Bhd the 'purported owner' of the land pursuant to the Power of Attorney had been in communication with the respondent's solicitors. These facts undoubtedly show that the substituted service effected by way of the advertisement was effective and suffiient service to bring the original action to the notice of the appellant. In the case of<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_390;"><i>Koh Thong Kuang v. United Malayan Banking Corporation Berhad</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 390</LINK>; [1994] 3 MLJ 509; [1994] 4 CLJ 488; [1994] 3 AMR 2239, where the appellant borrower evaded service and did not reside at the last known address but fied his affiavit two days after substituted service was effected, the Supreme Court held that the fact that he fied the affiavit after the substituted service effected demonstrated the effiacy of the substituted service provided by the rules. The learned judge in the instant case was satisfid that the service was regular and this decision was affimed by the Court of Appeal. After considering the material evidence before us, we are equally satisfid that the instant action and the affiavit in support thereof did not show that the service of the original action was irregular. The appellant had accordingly failed to discharge the burden of proving that the service was irregular.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In all the circumstances and for the reasons to which we have alluded, we accordingly come to the ineluctable conclusion that the instant action arose from the same issues, facts and cause of action raised in a previous action. The principle of <i>res judicata</i> and <i>estoppel</i> should apply to preclude the appellant's claim from being proceeded with against the respondent. Further, it must be emphasised in our conclusion that the equitable doctrine of laches worked against the appellant in this appeal. The appellant had also failed to prove that the service of the original action was irregular. In the event, we dismissed this appeal with cost of RM7,000.00 to be paid to the respondent and the deposit to account of costs to the respondent.</p>
