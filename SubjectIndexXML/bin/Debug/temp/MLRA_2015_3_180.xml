    <p>The principal offender was first charged with murder punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code ('Code')</LINK>. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents were charged with abetting the principal offender in the murder. The prosecution applied for all three to be jointly tried. However, the principal offender was subsequently offered an alternative charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Code</LINK>, pleaded guilty to it and was sentenced upon conviction to 16 years' imprisonment from his date of arrest. He was acquitted of the murder charge. The principal offender admitted the contents of exh P3 - the statement of brief facts - which not only described his actions in the killing but also detailed the involvement of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents. After the conviction and sentencing of the principal offender, counsel applied to recuse the judge on the ground that her mind would have been prejudiced by the facts outlined in exh P3. The trial of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents was subsequently taken over by a different High Court Judge ("JC"). Counsel raised a preliminary objection on the ground that since the principal offender had been acquitted of murder, the charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents for abetting the principal offender in the murder was unsustainable in law and ought to be quashed. The JC allowed the objection, held the charge defective, unsustainable and prejudicial, and ordered that both respondents be discharged not amounting to an acquittal. The JC observed that the Public Prosecutor was at liberty to consider amending the charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents. The prosecution thereafter charged both the respondents in the Sessions Court with an amended charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK>. On the first day of trial in the Sessions Court, the prosecution decided to revert to the earlier charge of murder and abetment against the respondents, but with the additional element of conspiracy. The prosecution then applied for the case to be transmitted to the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC")</LINK>. Counsel objected on the ground that the charge was mala fide, oppressive and an abuse of court process. The Sessions Court subsequently quashed the charge and ordered the respondents to be discharged not amounting to acquittal. The prosecution thereafter applied to the High Court for a revision of the Sessions Court order and to proceed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK>. The High Court refused and instead remitted the case back to the Sessions Court for the trial of an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK>. The High Court acting on revision was of the view that since the prosecution had not appealed against the earlier JC's order discharging the respondents from abetment of murder charge, the prosecution was estopped from reverting to the charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK>. The High Court acting on revision was of the view that the JC's order of discharge remained valid and subsisting. The prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeal against the decision of the High Court acting on revision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Whilst the High Court judge acting on revision was right to hold that the discharge order was valid and subsisting, he was wrong in ruling that by reason of the subsistence of the order the prosecution was estopped from reverting to the charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK>. The discharge order not amounting to acquittal was not an appealable order as it was a procedural ruling which did not dispose of the rights of the parties. As the rights of the parties had not been finally determined when the discharge order was made, it was open to the Public Prosecutor to re-charge the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents with the same offence or, for that matter, with any other offence deemed fit. It would be different if the discharge order had amounted to an acquittal. The prosecution was therefore right in the circumstances not to appeal against the discharge order. (paras 23-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Discretion lies absolutely with the Attorney-General in his capacity as Public Prosecutor to continue or to discontinue any criminal proceedings against any person under any penal law other than proceedings before a Syariah Court, a native court or a court-martial. Such power is conferred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;145.;;">art 145(3) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> and is not questionable in any court of law. <i>Long bin Samat &amp; Ors v. Public Prosecutor (folld)</i>. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The issue was whether the prosecution had sufficient evidence to prove the charge rather than whether there was abuse of the court process by the prosecution. If the prosecution was malicious, the remedy lay elsewhere or in taking separate legal action but not by preventing the prosecution from proving its case. This was tantamount to denying the Public Prosecutor, who acts on behalf of the public, the right to be heard. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, since the trial had not even started, it was too early in the day for both the Sessions Court and the High Courts to quash or dismiss the charge without hearing the evidence. What the Sessions Court and the High Courts did in the instant case was to practically deny the Public Prosecutor of his discretionary power and constitutional right to proceed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK>. When a charge for an offence triable by the High Court is tendered before a subordinate court, the duty of the Magistrate or Sessions Court judge is to simply transmit the case to the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK>. (paras 34-35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> It was beyond the jurisdiction of the Sessions Court judge to question and to decide on the legal technicalities of the charge. Neither was it his function to question the wisdom of the Public Prosecutor in deciding to proceed with the more serious charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK> rather than the less serious charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK>. (para 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">Section 177A of the CPC</LINK> is drafted in mandatory language. The Sessions Court judge had no discretion not to transmit the case to the High Court, let alone to have "quashed" the charge and to release the respondents without condition, bearing in mind this was a non-bailable offence. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> In view of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A(3) of the CPC</LINK>, the High Court judge acting on revision should have set aside the order of discharge made by the Sessions Court judge and fixed a trial date and ordered the respondents remanded in custody pending disposal of the case. In the instant case, there was a clear disconnect between what <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK> required and what all the three courts had done in dealing with the case. (paras 37-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> There was nothing in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;;">Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994</LINK> to stop the court from proceeding with the hearing in the absence of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent and to make any order it deemed fit. The circumstances of the case did not justify an adjournment of the hearing. (para 43)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In the High Court at Sibu, Sarawak one Ling Hoe Ing was charged before Supang Lian J with the murder of the late Wong Jing Kui and the charge against him was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents were charged with abetting him in the murder and the charge against them was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The offence carries the mandatory death sentence upon conviction. On 21 January 2013 the learned judge allowed the prosecution's application for a joint trial. However, pursuant to a letter of representation by Ling Hoe Ing, the Public Prosecutor on 1 October 2013 offered him an alternative charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code ("the Code")</LINK>, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> He pleaded guilty to the alternative charge and was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment with effect from his date of arrest. He was acquitted of the principal murder charge. The brief facts of case marked as exh P3 was admitted to be correct by Ling Hoe Ing. All elements of the offence with which he was charged were present in the brief facts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Among the facts admitted was that he was instructed and instigated by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent to kill his girlfriend's husband before 20 June 2012. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's girlfriend is the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. Ling Hoe Ing agreed to carry out the murder for money as he was desperate to settle his debt with his employer amounting to RM13,000.00. His employer had threatened to chop off his hands and legs if he failed to pay the debt. It was agreed that if the murder was successful, the debt would be paid off by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent. The deceased was a Bank Manager at the time of his death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The modus operandi was for the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent to leave the back door to their house unlocked to facilitate Ling Hoe Ing's entry. Also to be left unlocked was the door to her husband's bedroom. He was to be killed while he was sleeping. On 14 June 2012 at about 1.30am, Ling Hoe Ing carried out the murder as planned. The deceased put up a fight but was overpowered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> During the murder the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent and her young son were present in the room but she did nothing to help her husband when Ling Hoe Ing stabbed him several times in the body and neck using a knife. In fact, when her son started crying and calling "papa, papa" after seeing his father being brutally murdered, the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent covered his mouth with a blanket to silence him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We find it necessary to relate the admitted facts in this judgment as they establish, in point of law, that what Ling Hoe Ing did to the deceased was an act of murder within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Code</LINK> notwithstanding his plea of guilt to a lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the same Code</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">Section 300 of the Code</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> With the conviction of Ling Hoe Ing under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Code</LINK>, counsel for the respondents applied for the learned judge to recuse herself on the ground that her mind would have been prejudiced by the facts as outlined in exh P3. The learned judge then indicated to the parties that she would write to the Honourable Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak for advice on the next course of action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 20 January 2014, presumably upon the recusal of Supang Lian J, the conduct of the trial was taken over by the learned Judicial Commissioner Azhahari Kamal Ramli ("the learned JC"). At the outset of the proceeding, counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection on the ground that since Ling Hoe Ing had been acquitted of the murder of Wong Jing Kui, the charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents for abetting him in the murder was unsustainable in law and urged the learned JC to quash the charge. Ruling was reserved to 26 February 2014.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 26 February 2014 the learned JC delivered his ruling. He acceded to the respondents' objection and ruled that the abetment of murder charge as it stood was "defective, unsustainable and prejudicial". Consequently he ordered both respondents to be discharged not amounting to acquittal. He however said that the Public Prosecutor was at liberty to consider amending the charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Perhaps taking the cue from what the learned JC said, the prosecution on the same day proffered an amended charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK> against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents in the Sessions Court. The new charge was that they abetted Ling Hoe Ing not in the murder of Wong Jing Kui but in committing the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The charge reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The penalty for the offence upon conviction is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 30 years and the offender is also liable to a fine. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents claimed trial to the charge and the learned Sessions Court Judge fixed five days for hearing commencing on 8 September 2014. However, on the first day of trial on 8 September 2014, the prosecution decided to revert to the original charge of abetting Ling Hoe Ing in the murder of Wong Jing Kui, with a slight variation by adding the element of conspiracy. The charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents now reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The prosecution then applied for the case to be transmitted to the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the Criminal Procedure Code ("the CPC")</LINK>. Counsel for the respondents again raised an objection, this time on the ground that the charge was mala fide, oppressive and an abuse of the court process. It was a re-run of the issue raised before the learned JC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned Sessions Court Judge reserved ruling to 10 September 2014, on which date he upheld the objection by quashing the charge and ordering the respondent's to be discharged not amounting to acquittal. He agreed with counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents that it was an abuse of process for the prosecution to revert to the abetment of murder charge after the same charge had been "quashed" by the learned JC on 26 February 2014. He went on to say that what the prosecution did was tantamount to contempt of court. The decision of the learned Sessions Court Judge effectively extinguished the charge and set the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents free without any condition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Dissatisfied with the order, the Public Prosecutor applied to the High Court for revision, asking for the order of the Sessions Court to be set aside and for the High Court to proceed with the case in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Having heard submissions from both sides, Lee Heng Cheong J on 23 October 2014 refused to grant the prosecution's application and instead sent the case back to the Sessions Court with an order that the trial for the charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK> or "such appropriate charges" was to proceed before another Sessions Court Judge. In the meantime he ordered the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents to be released on bail on the same terms and conditions as those granted by the Sessions Court in the earlier proceeding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Against the learned judge's decision, the Public Prosecutor appealed to this court. The sole issue for determination before us is whether the learned judge was right in remitting the case back to the Sessions Court for trial of an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK> instead of dealing with the case in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Having gone through the record of appeal and the grounds of judgment carefully, it is clear to us that the basis for the learned judge's decision can be traced back to the Public Prosecutor's decision to retain the abetment of murder charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK> after the principal offender was offered a reduced charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Code</LINK> and had pleaded guilty thereto.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> This was the issue that was ventilated before the learned JC and which prompted him to discharge the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents on 26 February 2014. We pause here to note that in actual fact the learned JC did not "quash" the charge as contended by learned counsel and the learned Sessions Court Judge. It was the learned Sessions Court Judge himself who made such order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> No appeal was filed by the prosecution against the learned JC's decision to discharge the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents. In his ruling at p 7 of the record of appeal, this is how the learned High Court Judge dealt with the matter:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As is patently clear from the passage quoted above, the learned judge's view was that since the prosecution did not appeal against the discharge order, they were estopped from reverting to the abetment of murder charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK>. It was also his view that since the order was made after hearing the merits of the case, it was a final order and therefore appealable. In his full grounds of judgment dated 21 November 2014, the learned judge concluded that since no appeal was filed by the Public Prosecutor, the order of discharge remains valid and subsisting and was binding on him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> With all due respect to the learned judge, while he was right in holding that the discharge order was valid and subsisting, we are of the view that he was wrong in ruling that by reason of the subsistence of the order the prosecution was estopped from reverting to the charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the first place the discharge order not amounting to acquittal was not an appealable order as it was a procedural ruling which did not dispose of the rights of the parties: (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_9;"><i>PP v. RK Menon &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 9</LINK>, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1984_2_119;"><i>Indran &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [1984] 2 MLRH 119</LINK>; [1985] 1 MLJ 326 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1984_1_146;"><i>Maleb Su v. PP &amp; Another Case</i> [1984] 1 MLRH 146</LINK>; [1984] 1 MLJ 311; [1984] 2 CLJ 232). Further, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;3.;;">s 3 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> defines the word "decision" to mean:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As the rights of the parties had not been finally determined when the discharge order was made, it was open to the Public Prosecutor to re-charge the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents with the same offence or, for that matter, with any other offence he deemed fit. It would be different if the discharge order had amounted to an acquittal. The prosecution was therefore right in the circumstances not to appeal against the discharge order. If they did, they would have been met with a formidable objection by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents, on the authority of the decisions referred to above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The constitutional position is that the discretion lies absolutely with the Attorney-General in his capacity as Public Prosecutor to continue or to discontinue any criminal proceedings against any person under any penal law other than proceedings before a Syariah Court, a native court or a courtmartial. This power is conferred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;145.;;">art 145(3) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> and is not questionable in any court of law. Anyone who is dissatisfied with his decision should seek his remedy elsewhere, but not in the courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In saying this we are merely echoing what Suffian LP said in delivering the judgment of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1974_1_412;"><i>Long bin Samat &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [1974] 1 MLRA 412</LINK>; [1974] 2 MLJ 152 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents raised the issue of mala fide and abuse of process. It was argued that the prosecution acted in bad faith when they decided to proceed with the capital charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK> when the charge against the principal offender, namely Ling Hoe Ing, had been reduced to a lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Code</LINK>. With the acquittal of the principal offender of the murder charge, there was no murder to abet. So goes the argument of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> No local authority directly on point was referred to us by either side for our consideration. The High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2003_6_876;"><i>PP lwn. Mat Saad Mat Isa &amp; Yang Lain Dan Kes Yang Lain</i> [2003] 6 MLRH 876</LINK> cited by the learned DPP during the proceedings before the learned JC is not such authority as the facts are materially different in that the abetment of murder charge against the alleged abettor in that case was amended to an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Code</LINK> by the court after the defence had closed its case. The issue of whether a charge of abetment to murder could remain after the principal offender pleaded guilty to the alternative charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Code</LINK> was not before the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The Privy Council case of <i>Hui Chi-Ming v. The Queen</i> [1992] 1 AC 34 is closer to the point. The essential facts are these. "A" was charged with murder together with three others but two of them pleaded guilty to manslaughter and the other was acquitted. The appellant was initially charged with manslaughter on advice from the Legal Department of the Attorney General's Chambers. But on the advice of another Crown counsel who was assigned to prosecute the case, the appellant was charged with murder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> "A" who was the principal offender was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to six years imprisonment. The appellant was convicted of murder after a full trial and sentenced to death. Under the circumstances, it was argued on behalf of the appellant that to prosecute the appellant for murder rather than manslaughter amounted to an abuse of process which would have justified and even called for the trial judge's refusal to allow the prosecution to proceed. The appellant's argument in this regard was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In dismissing the appellant's appeal, the Privy Council held that the prosecution of the appellant for murder rather than manslaughter was not so unfair or wrong as to constitute an abuse of process which should have led the judge to refuse to allow the trial to proceed. It was further held that although the appellant's conviction for murder when the principal offender had been convicted of manslaughter only and the prosecution had accepted pleas of guilty to manslaughter from three other participants was a serious anomaly, there was ample evidence to support the defendant's conviction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Thus, the issue in our view boils down to the question whether the prosecution has sufficient evidence to prove the charge rather than the question whether there was abuse of the court process by the prosecution. If the prosecution proves to be malicious, the remedy lies elsewhere or in taking separate legal action but not by preventing the prosecution from proving its case. This is tantamount to denying the Public Prosecutor, who acts on behalf of the public of the right to be heard.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Since the trial had not even started, clearly it was too early in the day for both the Sessions Court and the High Courts to "quash" or "dismiss" the charge without hearing the evidence. It is in this respect that the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_2_459;"><i>Sanjeev Kumar Veerasingam v. PP &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2015] 2 MLRA 459</LINK>; [2015] 2 AMR 528 [Criminal Appeals Nos: W-09-153-05-2013; W-09-155-05- 2013; W-06B-33-05-2013] relied on by learned counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent is readily distinguishable. It is obvious in that case that the finding of not guilty against the two appellants (who were charged with abetting the principal offender who was acquitted) was arrived at upon consideration of evidence adduced after a full trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> What the Sessions Court and the High Courts did in the present case was to practically deny the Public Prosecutor of his discretionary power and constitutional right to proceed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK>. The procedure is that when a charge for an offence triable by the High Court is tendered before a subordinate court, the duty of the Magistrate or Sessions Court Judge is to simply transmit the case to the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Clearly it was beyond the jurisdiction of the learned Sessions Court Judge to question and to decide on the legal technicalities of the charge. Neither was it his function to question the wisdom of the Public Prosecutor in deciding to proceed with the more serious charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">ss 109</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">34 of the Code</LINK> rather than the less serious charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a)</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;109.;;">s 109 of the Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">Section 177A of the CPC</LINK> is couched in mandatory language. Thus, the learned Sessions Court Judge had no discretion not to transmit the case to the High Court, let alone to have "quashed" the charge and to release the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents without condition, bearing in mind this is a non-bailable offence. Perhaps we should at this juncture reproduce <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK> to appreciate its true import:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Given the clear wording of subsection (3) above, what the learned High Court Judge should have done when the case came up for revision before him was to set aside the order of discharge made by the learned Sessions Court Judge and to fix a trial date and order the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents to be remanded in custody pending disposal of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> It is unfortunate that the error by the learned JC in the first instance and, with the greatest of respect, aggravated by the decisions of the learned Sessions Court Judge and the learned High Court Judge subsequent thereto had resulted in a serious procedural impasse causing the trial to stall even before the prosecution called its first witness. There is a clear disconnect between what <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;177A.;;">s 177A of the CPC</LINK> requires and what all three courts below had done in dealing with this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> At the hearing of this appeal on 10 February 2015, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent failed to turn up. This is not totally unexpected as he was also absent when the Public Prosecutor's application for revision came up for hearing before the learned High Court Judge on 23 October 2014. According to counsel, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent had gone to the Sibu High Court by mistake thinking that this appeal was to be heard in Sibu.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> However, as the matter involved a pure question of law, learned counsel had no serious objection if the court were to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent but placed on record a caveat that no adverse order should be made against his client in any event. Presumably learned counsel was referring to the procedure prescribed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;314.;;">s 314 of the CPC</LINK> for appeals to the High Court, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The relevant procedural provision relating to appeals to the Court of Appeal is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;16.;;">r 16(2) of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994 ("the Rules")</LINK> which stipulates as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> It is clear that there is nothing in the Rules to stop the court from proceeding with the hearing in the absence of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent and to make any order it deems fit. In any event, we do not think that the circumstances of the case justified an adjournment of the hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> This after all is not a case where the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's absence was due to the fact that he had not been served with the notice of hearing or that he was not aware of the hearing date. He knew of the hearing date except that he went to the Sibu High Court by mistake (that is what counsel told us) instead of the Kuching High Court where the appeal was to be heard. We find it strange that he and his counsel went separate ways for this appeal, one to the Sibu High Court and the other to the Kuching High Court. We can only hazard a guess that there had been a total breakdown of communication between the two.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> For all the reasons aforesaid we allowed the Public Prosecutor's appeal and ordered that the case be reverted to the Sibu High Court for trial before another judge. The 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent was ordered to be remanded pending final disposal of the case as the offence charged is non-bailable. As for the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, we ordered for a warrant of arrest to be issued against him to secure his attendance at the trial.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
