    <p>The appellant appointed one Integrated Maker Sdn Bhd ("IMSB") as main contractor through a letter of award ("exh P2") to carry out some cleaning work ("the works") at its dockyard. In turn, IMSB appointed the respondent as its subcontractor for the works through a letter of award ("exh P3"). It was undisputed that the respondent had no contractual relationship whatsoever with the appellant in respect of the works Subsequently, the respondent sued the appellant for payment in respect of the works The respondent's suit was based on its claim that IMSB had assigned its rights under exh P2 to the respondent through two letters - exhs P7 and P10. The appellant contended that there was no such assignment. The appellant argued that the respondent had not pleaded whether any such assignment was legal or equitable. The High Court however allowed the respondent's claim with costs The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:-</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court erred when it made a specific finding of legal assignment even though the respondent neither pleaded nor submitted on such assignment. The High Court further erred when it held that the right that was assigned was IMSB's right to receive payment under the main contract from the appellant, when the respondent had pleaded that the chose in action was IMSB's right to pay the respondent under the subcontract. There was also a misapplication of the law on assignment and the judge had failed to judicially appreciate the factual matrix of the case. (paras 21-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> No particular form is required in order to establish an assignment in writing. However, the language used to write the assignment must be absolute in that it will pass the entire interest of the assignor in the chose in action. <i>UMW Industries (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Ah Fook (folld)</i>. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court's reliance on <i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Aluminex (M) Sdn Bhd (Receivers And Managers Appointed) &amp; Anor</i> was flawed and misplaced. In <i>Aluminex (supra)</i>, the issue <i>inter alia</i>, was whether the loan cum assignment was absolute. However, in the instant case the issue was whether exhs P7 and P10 could be deemed to be an assignment. <i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Aluminex (M) Sdn Bhd (Receivers And Managers Appointed) &amp; Anor (distd)</i>. (paras 32-37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The High Court, in construing exhs "P7" and "P10", applied the test laid down in <i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd</i> to ascertain whether the assignment is an absolute one. But, <i>Nouvau (supra)</i> would only be applicable if there was an agreement creating the assignment and the only issue was to decide whether such assignment was absolute. Just like <i>Aluminex (supra)</i>, there was also an expressly written and executed loan cum assignment agreement in <i>Nouvau (supra)</i>. In the present appeal, there was a complete absence of such agreement. <i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd (distd)</i>. (para 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Exhibits P7 and P10 did not give rise to an assignment and an assignment could not be inferred from it. The exhibits did not show the passing of IMSB's right to receive payment from the appellant absolutely under the main contract. The exhibits did not show an absolute conveyance. Exhibit P7 gave an option to the appellant whilst exh P10 gave the respondent an opportunity to make further arrangements for settlement of the outstanding sum. (paras 39 &amp; 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Even if one were to construe that an assignment could be ascertained from exhs P7 and P10, the requirement of express notice of the assignment had not been fulfilled. No evidence was led by the respondent to show that the required notice was given. In the instant case, the elements of legal assignment had not been fulfilled. Further, at all material times there was no contract between the respondent and the appellant in respect of the works The law is clear A person who is not a party to a contract has no right to sue on a contract. (paras 50, 58, 59 &amp; 63)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Malik Ishak JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Dynaforce Corporation Sdn Bhd ("respondent") filed a civil suit before the High Court at Kuala Lumpur and claimed from Boustead Naval Shipyard Sdn Bhd ("appellant") a sum of RM778,975.00 together with the interest and costs purportedly due to the respondent for cleaning services rendered at the appellant's dockyard in Lumut, Perak.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> After a full trial, the learned High Court Judge gave judgment in favour of the respondent. Aggrieved, the appellant now appeals to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The parties agreed that, at all material times, the respondent was not the appellant's contractor Integrated Maker Sdn Bhd ("IMSB") appointed the respondent as a subcontractor by way of a letter of award dated 2 March 2002 (exh "P3") as seen at pp 117 to 119 of the Appeal Record at Part "C" of vol 3. For convenience, exh "P3" was worded in this way and will now be reproduced:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It is also undisputed that the respondent had no contractual relationship whatsoever with the appellant in respect of the cleaning services</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The appellant appointed IMSB as the main contractor by way of a letter of award dated 15 March 2001 ("the main contract") as seen at pp 114 to 116 of the Appeal Record at Part "C" of vol 3 marked accordingly as exh "P2". Again, for convenience, exh "P2" containing the main contract will now be reproduced:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In suing the appellant, the respondent claimed that IMSB had assigned its rights under the main contract to the respondent on the strength of two letters, namely:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Exhibit "P7", for the sake of convenience, is now reproduced:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> For convenience, we will now reproduce exh "P10":-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Simply put, the respondent sued the appellant as an assignee of IMSB based on exhs "P7" and "P10" and succeeded before the High Court at Kuala Lumpur</p>
    <p>
      <b>Analysis</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It was the appellant's defence, on the balance of probabilities, that there was no such assignment. The respondent argued that by virtue of exhs "P7" and "P10", IMSB had assigned their right to pay directly to the respondent. The respondent's statement of claim in regard to the issue of assignment can be seen at paras 5, 8, and 10 as seen at p 32 of the Appeal Record at Part "A" of vol 1, and, for convenience, these paragraphs will now be reproduced:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The stand of the appellant was rather simple. That nowhere in the respondent's pleadings was it pleaded that such assignment was legal or equitable. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the act of paying cannot reasonably be construed or deemed as a legal chose in action. Consequently, it was argued that for these reasons, the respondent cannot legitimately claim the outstanding sums from the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> As alluded to earlier after a full trial, on 3 October 2012, the learned High Court Judge allowed the respondent's claim with costs The written grounds of judgment of Her Ladyship showed the following findings which she made:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Since time immemorial, pleadings play an important role in civil litigation. What is pleaded will no doubt serve to define the parameters of the case. The issues of facts and questions of law will be identified and they in turn will be adjudicated between the parties during trial. It gives to a large extent a distinct and clear notice of the case that will be adjudicated and this will prevent either party from being taken by surprise during trial. The court too will benefit from the pleaded case and could easily identify the issues for determination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The importance of pleadings was emphasised by Lord Edmund-Davies in <i>Farrell v. Secretary of State for Defence</i> [1980] 1 All ER 166. There, at p 173, His Lordship had this to say:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is also instructive to refer to the judgment of <i>Lord Diplock in Hadmor Productions Ltd And Others v. Hamilton And Another</i> [1983] 1 AC 191, particularly at p 233. There, His Lordship succinctly said:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The trial of the suit must be confined to the pleadings and the court is not entitled to decide the suit on a matter which is not pleaded. In short, the parties are bound by their pleadings (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_327;"><i>Yew Wan Leong v.

    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> To formulate and advance a complete cause of action, the material facts must be pleaded (<i>Bruce v. Odhams Press, Limited</i> [1936] 1 KB 697, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_3_659;"><i>RHB Bank Bhd v.

    <p>

    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Guided by the legal principles on pleadings, we hold that the learned High Court Judge erred in law when she made a specific finding of legal assignment even though the respondent neither pleaded nor submitted on them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> To compound the matter further, the learned High Court Judge asserted that the right that was assigned was IMSB's right to receive payment under the main contract from the appellant. In sharp contrast, the respondent pleaded that the chose in action is IMSB's right to pay the respondent under the subcontract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> A perusal of the written grounds of judgment of the learned High Court Judge showed that Her Ladyship had misapplied the law on assignment.We noted, with respect, that Her Ladyship also failed to judicially appreciate the factual matrix of the case when she found that there was a valid legal assignment which entitled the respondent to claim against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We found that the learned High Court Judge's findings erroneous for the following salient reasons:-</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>[25]</b> Proceeding ahead, we will now elaborate further under different subheadings</p>

      <b>Principles Of Construction Of Assignment Documents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">Section 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> defines the meaning of absolute assignment. It is worded as follows:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_190;"><i>UMW Industries (1985) Sdn Bhd v. Ah Fook</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 190</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 365; [1996] 1 CLJ 379 stipulates that to constitute an absolute legal assignment, a few requirements must be fulfilled. Chong Siew Fai CJ (Sabah and Sarawak) delivering the judgment of the court aptly said at p 191 of the report:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Continuing further at pp 191-192, His Lordship had this to say:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The law as enunciated in <i>Ah Fook</i>'s case (<i>supra</i>) by the Federal Court may be stated as follows Although there is no particular form that is required to be followed in establishing an assignment in writing, yet the language used in the writing that gives rise to an assignment must be absolute in that it will pass the entire interest of the assignor in the chose in action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Now, in the present appeal, the learned High Court Judge considered exhs "P7" and "P10" together with the oral evidence of the witnesses as well as the surrounding circumstances in order to arrive at her decision. The approach adopted by Her Ladyship followed closely the guidelines as set out by the Supreme Court in the case of <i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Aluminex (M) Sdn Bhd (Receivers And Managers Appointed) &amp; Anor (supra)</i> where Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ delivering the judgment of the court had this to say at p 745 of the report:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Likewise, the learned High Court Judge in her written grounds of judgment at p 14 of the Appeal Record at Part "A" of vol 1 had this to say:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Her Ladyship continued at p 22 of the Appeal Record at Part "A" of vol 1 wherein she expressed her opinion in this way:-</p>
    <p>"... adalah menjadi pendapat mahkamah ini bahawa kes yang paling sesuai untuk diikuti dalam kes ini berdasarkan fakta kes ini ialah kes <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_736;"><i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Aluminex (M) Sdn Bhd (Receivers And Managers Appointed) &amp; Anor</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 736</LINK>; [1993] 3 MLJ 587; [1994] 2 CLJ 188 di mana Mahkamah Agung telah memutuskan bahawa keadaan sekeliling boleh juga diambilkira oleh mahkamah semasa mahkamah menentukan isu samada terdapat penyerahan hak yang sempurna dari IMSB kepada plaintif untuk membolehkan plaintif membawa tuntutan dalam kes ini terhadap defendan."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> But the facts in <i>Aluminex (supra)</i> are different from the present appeal at hand. In that case, the assignment was created by way of an executed loan cum assignment agreement and it was registered as a charge in favour of its assignee. At p 745, Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ had this to say in <i>Aluminex (supra)</i>:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Here, in the present appeal at hand, in sharp contrast, there is no written and executed assignment agreement at all. Here, exhs "P7" and "P10" as reproduced earlier are letters signed singularly under the hand of IMSB and no specific terms of any assignment are stated therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> On the facts, <i>Aluminex (supra)</i> can readily be distinguished from the present appeal. There, the issue was whether the loan cum assignment agreement was absolute and gave United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd priority to a competing debenture. The Supreme Court, in determining this issue, considered the circumstances surrounding the execution of the agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Whereas here, the issue is centred on the question pertaining to exhs "P7" and "P10" and whether those exhibits can be deemed to be an assignment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Having compared and contrasted the facts of <i>Aluminex (supra)</i> with the present appeal at hand, it is apparent that reliance on <i>Aluminex (supra)</i> by the High Court Judge was flawed and misplaced. It cannot be denied that the issue of whether the surrounding circumstances can be taken into account in determining whether the assignment is absolute or by way of a charge is an approach which is purely secondary in nature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Language Employed In Exhibits "P7" And "P10" Do Not Demonstrate An Absolute Assignment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The High Court, in construing exhs "P7" and "P10", applied the test laid down in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_477;"><i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 477</LINK>; [1984] 2 MLJ 268; [1985] CLJ Rep 231 in ascertaining whether an assignment was an absolute one. But, <i>Nouvau Mont Dor (supra)</i> would only be applicable if there is an agreement creating the assignment and the only issue left to decide is whether that assignment is absolute. Just like <i>Aluminex (supra)</i>, there was also an expressly written and executed loan cum assignment agreement in <i>Nouvau Mont Dor (supra)</i>. Whereas in the present appeal, there is a complete absence of such agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We have perused through exhs "P7" and "P10" and we found that these exhibits do not give rise to an assignment and an assignment cannot be inferred from it. These exhibits do not show the passing of IMSB's right to receive payment from the appellant absolutely under the main contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The relevant part of exh "P7" which was reproduced earlier in this judgment will now be reproduced, once again. It reads as follows:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> This passage gives rise to the following implications Firstly, that the appellant may choose to pay the respondent directly for the cleaning services Secondly, even if the appellant chooses to do so, the payment by the appellant is still conditional.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We now take a look at exh "P10" which was reproduced earlier in this judgment. It states to the following effect: that IMSB would agree and would not object if the respondent arranges with the appellant directly for payment of the outstanding sum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Thus, it is perfectly in order to say that both exhs "P7" and "P10" do not show an absolute conveyance. Exhibit "P7" gives an option to the appellant while exh "P10" gives the respondent an opportunity to make further arrangements for settlement of the outstanding sum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> To compound the matter further, the scope of each exhibit is limited. We say that IMSB's option to the appellant, even if it is exercised, is still subject to conditions And IMSB's agreement to the respondent is limited to the outstanding sum only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Be that as it may, it is interesting to note that the two exhibits - referring to exhs "P7" and "P10", do not disclose which of the two rights that the High Court has found or that the respondent has pleaded, has been assigned. And if it has been assigned, to whom has it been assigned to.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> For these brief reasons, it is our judgment that exhs "P7" and "P10" taken collectively or individually do not create any assignment at all. These exhibits are far from perfect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> It is germane to mention that the parties knew that there was no assignment. It is for this reason that a meeting was held on 17 December 2004. In that meeting, Ismail Mokhtar bin Othman (DW1) proposed that either IMSB formally assign the proceeds from the main contract to the respondent or both the respondent and the appellant enter into a new contract. The minutes of that meeting can be seen at pp 126 to 129 of the Appeal Record at Part "C" of vol 3 and it is marked as exh "P8".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> With respect, the learned High Court Judge did not consider exh "P8" at all.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> We agreed with the submission of learned counsel for the appellant who submitted that the learned High Court Judge overlooked the floodgates that will be opened if letters like exhs "P7" and "P10" are deemed sufficient to constitute as legal assignments</p>
    <p>
      <b>No Express Notice Of The Assignment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Even if one were to construe that an assignment can be ascertained from exhs "P7" and "P10", yet the requirement of an express notice of the assignment has not been fulfilled. No evidence was led by the respondent to show that the required express notice was given.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Learned counsel for the respondent submitted before the High Court that notice can be deemed to have been given to the appellant for the simple reason that there is evidence that copies of exhs "P7", "P9" and "P10" had been given to the appellant. Exhibit "P9" is a letter dated 28 June 2005 enclosing the statement of account for the cleaning services and it can be seen at pp 130 to 132 of the Appeal Record at Part "C" of vol 3.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> It was rightly submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that even if copies of exhs "P7", "P9" and "P10" were given to the appellant, they were insufficient.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> It must be borne in mind that no express assignments had been created by exhs "P7" and "P10". The same conclusion would equally apply to exh "P9".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> There is uncertainty in the chose of action and there is also uncertainty as to whom it is assigned to. That being the case, the person who is liable to IMSB and to whom the notice is due are also uncertain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The High Court held that if the chose in action constitutes IMSB's right to receive payment under the main contract, then IMSB's express notice is specifically due to the appellant. But, if the chose in action constitutes IMSB's "right to pay the respondent" under the IMSB's subcontract as pleaded by the respondent, then IMSB's express notice is specifically due to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> It is pertinent to note that both exhs "P7" and "P9" were addressed to the appellant while exh "P10" was addressed to the respondent. It must be mentioned that the High Court merely agreed to the respondent's submission without providing further explanation as reflected at lines 1 to 3 of p 18 of the Appeal Record at Part "A" of vol 1. That being the case, the following crucial questions remain unanswered:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> However, it is the stand taken by the appellant that none of these crucial questions constitute that express notice. We agreed with the appellant that there are far too many variables and uncertainties, and the sweeping submissions of the respondent to prop up the scenarios of notice cannot stand curial scrutiny and should not be sustained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In our judgment, the elements of legal assignment have not been fulfilled. Serious uncertainties existed in regard to the nature of the assignment and the parties to the assignment. The sharp contrast between the respondent's pleaded case and the High Court judgment as alluded to earlier cannot be ignored.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In regard to the issue of privity of contract which was raised in the memorandum of appeal, we have this to say. At all material times, there was no contract between the respondent and the appellant for providing cleaning services and for supplying manpower and equipment at the appellant's dockyard. This was consistently admitted by the respondent's witnesses</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Mustafa bin Ahmad (PW2) admitted in his witness statement that IMSB is the appellant's main contractor while the respondent is IMSB's subcontractor That being the case, IMSB would pay the respondent for the respondent's services once IMSB receive payment from the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Zulkifli bin Hamid (PW1) and Khamdi bin Khalip @ Leman (PW3) admitted under cross-examination that there was no contract executed between the respondent and the appellant even after DW1 proposed that a fresh contract be entered directly between the appellant and the respondent during the meeting between the representatives of the parties on 17 December 2004 when the issue of outstanding payment came to light.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> DW1's evidence in regard to the absence of any contract between the respondent and the appellant has always been consistent, even during crossexamination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The law is clear A person who is not a party to a contract has no right to sue on a contract (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1967_1_426;"><i>Kepong Prospecting Ltd &amp; Ors v. Schmidt</i> [1967] 1 MLRA 426</LINK>; [1968] 1 MLJ 170 and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2(d) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1992_1_66;"><i>Oversea Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v. Woo Hing Brothers (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [1992] 1 MLRH 66</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 86; [1992] 3 CLJ Rep 171 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">Section 2(d) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> provides that consideration for a promise may move from the promisee or any other party. It cannot be denied that the scope of the section is wider than the English rule that requires consideration to move from the promisee (see the speech of Lord Wilberforce in <i>Kepong Prospecting Ltd &amp; Ors v. Schmidt (supra)</i> at p 431). It is a correct proposition of law to say that in Malaysia, the doctrine of privity is confined to the rule that only a party to a contract may sue on it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> The case of <i>Tweddle v. Atkinson</i> [1861] 1 B&amp;S 393, at 397; 121 ER 762, at 763 to 764, molded the doctrine of privity in its present form. The facts in that case may be stated thus William Tweddle was engaged to Guy's daughter To provide for the young couple after their marriage, Guy and Tweddle's father by the name of John, agreed between them that each would pay William Tweddle £100. It was further agreed that William Tweddle could sue for these sums When he died, Guy had still not paid the promised sum and William Tweddle sued the executor, Atkinson, for the money.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> William Tweddle's action failed. He was described as "a stranger to the consideration" and, not having paid for the promise, could not enforce it. The fact that Guy had made no promise to him would also have debarred him from recovery on the grounds of privity of contract. Wightman J had this to say:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> After <i>Tweddle v. Atkinson (supra)</i>, the doctrine of privity was firmly established as part and parcel of the English common law in the case of <i>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, Limited v. Selfridge And Company, Limited</i> [1915] AC 847. There, Viscount Haldane LC aptly said at p 853:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Mohamed Dzaiddin J (later the Chief Justice) rightly said in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1987_1_484;"><i>Fima Palmbulk Services Sdn Bhd v. Suruhanjaya Pelabuhan Pulau Pinang &amp; Anor</i> [1987] 1 MLRH 484</LINK> at p 486; [1988] 1 MLJ 269; [1988] 1 CLJ 346; [1988] 1 CLJ Rep 534 that, "It is clear that the English doctrine of privity of contract applies to our law of contract".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The doctrine of privity of contract is here to stay. In <i>Murphy And Others v. Bower</i> [1866] 2 IRCL 506, the court categorically stated that, "no stranger to the consideration can take advantage of a contract, although made for his benefit". Bluntly put, only the parties to the contract have enforceable rights and obligations under the contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> As an established principle of contract law, the common law doctrine of privity of contract stands for the simple proposition that, "no one but the parties to a contract can be bound by it or entitled under it" (<i>Greenwood Shopping Plaza Limited v. Robert Walker Beattie and Roy Vincent Pettipas</i> [1980] 2 SCR 228, at p 229).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> For the varied reasons alluded to in this judgment, we unanimously allowed the appeal of the appellant with costs of RM50,000.00 here and below. We set aside the decision of the High Court. Deposit refunded to the appellant.</p>
