    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was charged in the High Court with trafficking in dangerous drugs. At the material time, upon his arrival at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the appellant was asked by a customs officer to have his bag ("the bag") scanned. The customs officer also checked a bulge which he noticed on the back of the jacket that the appellant was wearing. When the bag was opened and the contents removed, two packets of crystalline substances were found. A check on the jacket also revealed a hidden packet containing crystalline substances. The crystalline substances found in the appellant's bag and jacket were confirmed by the chemist to contain methamphetamine ("the drugs"). At the end of the prosecution's case, the trial judge was satisfied that a prima facie case had been established against the appellant and called upon the appellant to enter his defence. Having heard the defence, the trial judge found that the appellant's explanation failed to cast any reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. At the conclusion of the trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. In this appeal against his conviction and sentence, the appellant attacked the verdict of the trial judge on the following grounds: no written grounds of judgment were given by the trial judge; the police failed to investigate the information given by the appellant on the role played by one Ashgar Zabzali ("Ashgar"), whom the appellant claimed was the person who gave the bag to him to be brought to Malaysia; the trial judge failed to consider the conduct of the appellant which was indicative of his innocence; and the drugs were hidden and therefore the appellant could not have been aware of them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the Appeal Record showed that at the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge had properly directed his mind to the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. The trial judge then went on to deal with the defence case, which was a defence of no knowledge, and concluded that the defence was a total fabrication. Clearly, this was not a case where the trial judge merely delivered his decision without giving any reasons. What the trial judge did was to deliver his grounds <i>ex tempore</i>. The grounds delivered <i>ex tempore</i> by the trial judge were as good as written grounds provided after a notice of appeal was filed. (paras 10-12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was no conflict between the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and what the appellant told the investigating officer with regard to the role played by Ashgar. The defence version during cross-examination was a repeat of what the appellant told the police during the investigation, ie that he was asked by Ashgar to carry the bag to Malaysia. Since there was no conflict of evidence on any material fact in issue which had a bearing on the credibility of any of the prosecution witnesses, the necessity for the police to investigate the information given by the appellant with regard to the role played by Ashgar likewise did not arise. (paras 20-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Even assuming it was true that Ashgar did exist and that he had asked the appellant to carry the bag to Malaysia, the question for the trial court to consider was whether the accused had knowledge of the drugs. That was a matter for the appellant to disprove by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("DDA")</LINK> and not for the prosecution to establish. Thus, whether he was asked by someone to carry the bag was irrelevant in any event. Following that, the presence of the same type of drugs in the appellant's jacket dispelled any doubt as to his knowledge about the drugs in the bag, as the appellant did not state that he was also asked by Ashgar to wear the jacket on his trip to Malaysia. Therefore, the trial judge was right in finding that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs. This finding by necessary implication meant that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge. (paras 27 &amp; 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In view of the large quantity of the drugs and the clever way they were hidden from view to avoid detection, an inference of trafficking could be drawn against the appellant. The onus was on him to give a plausible explanation to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case as to whether the drugs were for the purpose of trafficking or otherwise. Since the appellant did not say anything on the purpose for which he was carrying the drugs, there was no material before the trial judge for him to consider whether the appellant's explanation had cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. In the circumstances, the trial judge was right in finding that the charge had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. (paras 32-33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The argument that the conduct of the appellant at the airport showed his innocence rather than his guilt could not be accepted. Evidence of innocent conduct was neither here nor there because if it were so, all that a suspect needed to do to avoid liability was to act innocent, the better he was at it the more likely that he would get away with the crime. (paras 37-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The argument that since the drugs were hidden from view, the appellant could not have known of its presence, should not be given much weight as per the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <i>Zulfikar bin Mustaffah v. PP</i> which the Federal Court cited with approval in <i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i>. Aside from the factual question of whether an inference of knowledge could be drawn where the drugs were hidden from view, it was important to remember that the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK> was a presumption of law and as such the court had no discretion not to invoke it upon proof of custody or control. (<i>Muhammed Hassan v. PP (folld)</i>; <i>PP v. Zulkifli Arshad (folld)</i>). (paras 40-41)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, an Iranian national was charged in the High Court at Shah Alam with trafficking in a dangerous drug and the charge against him is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the conclusion of the trial he was found guilty and sentenced to death. This is his appeal against the conviction and sentence. The salient facts are as follows. On 26 January 2009 at about 2.45pm on his arrival at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport from Doha, Qatar the appellant was asked by Customs Officer Mokhadinil Akma bin Mokhtar (SP3) to have his bag scanned. He did as told and as he was bending down to lift the bag, SP3 noticed a bulge on the back of the jacket that he was wearing. After getting the appellant's permission, SP3 touched the bulge with his hand and it felt like sand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the same time SP3 was informed by Customs Officer Nur Shakirah binti Zulkifli (SP4) who was operating the scanning machine that a suspicious green image was detected inside the appellant's bag. The appellant was then asked to go to another room at the airport for a further check. Both the bag and the jacket were checked. The appellant himself opened the bag by turning the combination numbers of the lock.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> When the bag was opened and the contents removed, Senior Customs Officer Elangovan a/l Rethnesamy (SP5) found two packets of crystalline substances hidden in two secret compartments on the right and left walls of the bag. A check on the jacket also revealed a hidden packet containing crystalline substances. SP5 had to make a small cut at the bulging section of the jacket to retrieve the packet.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The crystalline substances found in the appellant's bag and jacket were sent for analysis and were confirmed by the Chemist to contain 540.9 grams of methamphetamine. Possession without lawful authority of 50 grams or more of this drug attracts the presumption of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)(xvi) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('the DDA')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On these facts the learned trial judge was satisfied that a prima facie case had been established against the appellant and he then called upon the appellant to enter his defence. Having heard the defence he found that the appellant's explanation failed to cast any reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. Accordingly he found the appellant guilty as charged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Before us the verdict was attacked on the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Ground (1)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The point raised was that without the written grounds of judgment this court would indirectly act as the trial court. According to counsel this would deprive the appellant of the first stage of the appeal at the Court of Appeal and would limit him to only the last stage of appeal to the Federal Court. It was submitted that this was a breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> (equality before the law). It was further submitted that if every other person is entitled to two chances of appeal, then the appellant should not be left with only one chance of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We found no substance to the argument as it is factually wrong. It is true that the learned trial judge did not provide any written grounds of judgment as is normally done after a notice of appeal is filed but in this case the learned judge had given his grounds both at the end of the prosecution case (pp 125-128 of the Record of Appeal) and at the close of the defence case (pp 137-138 of the Record of Appeal).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The record shows that at the conclusion of the trial the learned trial judge had properly directed his mind to the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> and this can be seen at p 137 of the Record of Appeal where he said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> He then went on to deal with the defence case, which was a defence of no knowledge. He concluded that the defence was a total fabrication ("satu rekaan semata-mata"). And he continued to say at p 138 of the Record of Appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Clearly this is not a case where the learned trial judge merely delivered his decision without giving any reason. What he did was to deliver his grounds <i>ex tempore</i>. In our view the grounds that he delivered <i>ex tempore</i> are as good as written grounds provided after a notice of appeal was filed. As for the merits of the case, we are firmly of the view that on the evidence before him the learned trial judge was correct in finding the appellant guilty of the offence charged. Ground (1) of the appeal must therefore fail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground (2)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was submitted that the failure by the Investigating Officer (SP6) to investigate the information given by the appellant on the role played by one Ashgar Zabzali ('Ashgar') had created a "huge lacuna" in the prosecution's case as the existence of Ashgar was undeniable. The information that the appellant gave to SP6 in the course of the investigation was that he (the appellant) was asked by Ashgar to carry the bag to Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The sheet anchor of counsel's argument is that since Ashgar's name had been brought up by the defence during the prosecution case the role of this person must be investigated, failing which an inference favourable to the appellant must be drawn, a reverse way of saying that an adverse inference must be drawn against the prosecution. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_286;"><i>Lee Kwan Woh v. PP</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 286</LINK>; [2009] 5 MLJ 301; [2009] 5 CLJ 631. In his written submissions counsel reproduced part of headnote (3) of the report, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> To put the matter in perspective we reproduce below what the Federal Court said at p 294 of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It is important to understand the context in which the above pronouncement was made. As every lawyer knows a decision is only authority for what it decides. What we can gather from the judgment is that at the trial prosecution witnesses PW4 and PW8 had testified that the appellant was arrested the moment he emerged from the car, carrying a white plastic bag containing the drug. This evidence was contradicted by the defence by way of 'putting' to PW4 and PW8 in cross-examination that the appellant was in fact arrested at the compound of house No 52 and not as he emerged from the car.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In delivering the judgment of the court Gopal Sri Ram FCJ held the view that since the appellant had informed the investigating officer his version of the incident during the investigation and before he was charged in court, the investigating officer ought to have investigated which version was the true version. In other words she should have investigated whether it was true that the appellant was arrested at the compound of house No 52 and not as he emerged from the car as claimed by PW4 and PW8.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> There is no doubt in our view that the reason why the Federal Court considered it important for the investigating officer to verify this fact was because the credibility of PW8 was in issue. The following passage at p 294 of the judgment may shed some light:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Having gone through the judgment carefully we are unable to see how the decision supports the appellant's contention. The case is not authority for saying that when a crime suspect mentions names during the course of an investigation, the police must in all cases investigate the role played by the named persons. In any event the facts in that case are poles apart from the facts of the present case. In that case it is clear that the prosecution and the defence version on a very material fact in issue was in conflict. That was the reason why the Federal Court considered the failure by the investigating officer to investigate the appellant's version to be a serious omission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In the present case there is no conflict between the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and what the appellant told the investigating officer with regard to the role played by Ashgar. The defence version that was 'put' to SP6 during cross-examination was a repeat of what the appellant told him during the investigation, ie that he was asked by Ashgar to carry the bag to Malaysia. This was readily admitted by SP6, so the issue of conflict of evidence does not arise at all. SP6 was also asked in cross-examination whether the appellant told him that the bag only contained diamonds. SP6 said the appellant did not tell him that.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Since there was no conflict of evidence on any material fact in issue which had a bearing on the credibility of any of the prosecution witnesses, the necessity for SP6 to investigate the information given by the appellant with regard to the role played by Ashgar likewise does not arise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> If at all any inference is to be drawn in favour of the appellant in terms of <i>Lee Kwan Woh v. PP (supra)</i>, it is the inference that he was told by the appellant that he was asked by Ashgar to carry the bag to Malaysia. As this was not disputed by the prosecution and in fact admitted by SP6, we fail to see how this 'favourable inference' could result in a gap in the prosecution case. More importantly since the appellant was alone when he was caught with the drugs, there is no question of the involvement of any other person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It must be understood that what counsel puts or suggests to a witness in cross-examination is not evidence. They are merely suggestions and to give notice to the prosecution that the defence has a different version of the events. They prove nothing and will remain nothing unless confirmed by the witness or by the party on whose behalf the suggestions are made when his turn comes to give evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The rule that the defence case must be put to the prosecution witnesses stems from the need to prevent surprises at the trial. Mukharji J in <i>AEG Carapiet v. AY Derderian</i> [1961] AIR Cal 359 explained the position thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It is a misconception however to think that the entire defence case must be put to the prosecution witnesses. What needs to be put are only those parts of the defence case which the witness or witnesses had any share in. For example, if the prosecution's version is that the drug was carried by the accused at the time of his arrest but the defence version is that it was carried by another person, what needs to be put to the relevant prosecution witness is that the drug was carried by that other person and not by the accused. That will be sufficient to lay the groundwork for that aspect of the defence case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is improper and in fact futile to put to the witness something which the witness had no share in or which he is in no position to confirm or deny. An example of such improper question is, "I put it to you that the accused was asked by Idi Amin to carry the drug to Malaysia" when there is no basis whatsoever to imply knowledge of such fact to the witness other than what the accused told him. That is a fact within the special knowledge of the accused and therefore for him to establish in his defence, if called. It is not for the witness to answer such question. The question would be proper though if it is put to the witness, "I put it to you that the accused told you he was asked by Idi Amin to carry the drug to Malaysia."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Even assuming it is true that Ashgar does exist and that he did ask the appellant to carry the bag to Malaysia, the question for the trial court to consider was whether the accused had knowledge of the drugs. To prove trafficking knowledge must of course be established but that is a matter for the appellant to disprove by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK> and not for the prosecution to establish at the close of its case once custody or control had been established. Thus, whether he was asked by someone to carry the bag is irrelevant in any event.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Further, if in fact the appellant had knowledge of the drugs, the fact that he was asked by Ashgar to carry the drug, even if true, will not exonerate him of the offence charged unless he can bring himself within the protection accorded by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;94.;;">s 94 of the Penal Code</LINK>, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It certainly is not the defence case that the appellant was under threat of instant death when he agreed to carry the bag to Malaysia for Ashgar. Furthermore, the appellant's claim that he was asked by Ashgar to carry the bag to Malaysia is highly improbable. To recapitulate, what he told SP6 was that Ashgar asked him to carry the bag to Malaysia. Note that he did not mention any other item other than the bag, which means his claim of lack of knowledge was only in relation to the drugs in the bag and not the drugs found elsewhere.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> But the fact is he was also carrying a packet of drug hidden in his jacket and it was not his case that he was also asked by Ashgar to wear the jacket on his trip to Malaysia. To our mind the presence of the same type of drugs in the appellant's jacket dispels any doubt as to his knowledge about the drugs in the bag. The learned trial judge was therefore right in finding that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs. This finding by necessary implication means that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge. Failure to rebut the presumption means that he had knowledge of the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> As to the question of whether the appellant was carrying the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, this is a matter of inference taking into account the definition of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the DDA</LINK> and the surrounding circumstances of the case: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_283;"><i>Ong Ah Chuan v. PP And Another Appeal</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 283</LINK>; [1981] 1 MLJ 64. The following passage is relevant (per Lord Diplock):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

      <b>[32]</b> In view of the large quantity of the drugs and the clever way they were hidden from view to avoid detection, an inference of trafficking (as opposed to a presumption of trafficking) can be drawn against the appellant. The onus was thus on him to give a plausible explanation on the lower burden of casting a reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case as to whether the drugs were for the purpose of trafficking or otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Since the appellant in his defence did not say anything on the purpose for which he was carrying such large amount of drug, his defence being a defence of no knowledge (and not that he was not trafficking), there was no material before the learned trial judge for him to consider whether the appellant's explanation had cast a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case as to whether he was carrying the drug for the purpose of trafficking or otherwise. In the circumstances the learned trial judge was right in finding that the charge had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. We do not therefore find anything in counsel's contention that SP6's failure to investigate the role played by Ashgar had affected the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Additionally and for completeness we need to mention that the truth of what Ashgar told the appellant had not even been established since he was not called to give evidence. The evidence is clearly hearsay and has no evidential value as the object of adducing the evidence was to establish the truth of what Ashgar told the appellant: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1956_1_59;"><i>Subramaniam v. PP</i> [1956] 1 MLRA 59</LINK>; [1956] 1 MLJ 220. It is trite law that the court must disregard all inadmissible evidence irrespective of whether any objection was raised when it was sought to be admitted: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_103;"><i>Malaysia National Insurance Sdn Bhd v. Malaysian Rubber Development Corp</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 103</LINK>; [1986] 2 MLJ 124; [1986] CLJ 185.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> If we were to accede to counsel's contention it would mean that every time an accused person drops names in the course of investigation, the investigating authority will have to look for these people, even if it means going to the edge of the world on a wild goose chase. That will not be to carry out investigation with a view to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt but to prove the case beyond the ghost of a doubt.</p>

      <b>Ground (3)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Under this ground the contention is that SP6 ought to have lifted fingerprints from the drug exhibits in the light of what the appellant told him regarding Ashgar. It was argued that if SP6 had managed to lift fingerprints from the drug exhibits, the fingerprint analysis might have shown that the appellant was telling the truth that Ashgar was the real trafficker. Our short answer to the argument is that the learned trial judge would have erred in law if he had faulted SP6 for failing to lift the fingerprints: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_35;"><i>PP v. Mansor Md Rashid &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 35</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 560; [1997] 1 CLJ 233.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground (4)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It was argued that the conduct of the appellant at the airport shows his innocence rather than his guilt. Counsel pointed out that the appellant showed no fear when asked by SP3 to scan his bag and to produce his travel documents. He also allowed SP3 to check his jacket without kicking a fuss. According to counsel, if indeed the appellant knew about the drugs he would have run away to save his life when SP3 called him over to have his bag scanned or at the very least would look drained or frightened.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We were unable to accede to the argument. Evidence of innocent conduct is neither here nor there because if it were so, all that a suspect needs to do to avoid liability is to act innocent, the better he is at it the more chances that he will get away with the crime. This ground also fails.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground (5)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The argument is that since the drugs were hidden from view the appellant could not have known of their presence. The answer to this contention is the familiar decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in <i>Zulfikar bin Mustaffah v. PP</i> [2001] 1 SLR 633 which the Federal Court cited with approval in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337. We are quite surprised that counsel had pursued this line of argument. We reproduce below what the Court of Appeal said at p 572:</p>

      <b>[40]</b> Aside from the factual question of whether an inference of knowledge can be drawn where the drugs were hidden from view, it is important to remember that the presumption of knowledge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(d) of the DDA</LINK> is a presumption of law and as such the court has no discretion not to invoke it upon proof of custody or control: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_311;"><i>Muhammed Hassan v. PP</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 311</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 273; [1998] 2 CLJ 170; [1998] 1 AMR 829 which was followed by another Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_560;"><i>PP v. Zulkifli Arshad</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 560</LINK>; [2011] 1 MLJ 599; [2010] 6 CLJ 121. In the former case Chong Siew Fai CJ (Sabah and Sarawak) delivering the judgment of the court said at p 321:</p>
