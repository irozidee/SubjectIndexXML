    <p>The appellant was the third successive administrator of an estate of one Ibrahim Samat ('deceased'). The first administrator was one Yusof whilst the second administrator was one Hamidah. The deceased's estate ('the estate') comprised a piece of land. Sometime in 1979, the deceased was said to have sold the land to the respondents. Yusof being the administrator of the estate at the material time lodged a private caveat alleging that the deceased could not have been the vendor who had sold the land to the respondents in 1979 as the deceased had passed away much earlier in 1945. The caveat then lapsed after six years. When Hamidah, became the administratrix of the estate, she too lodged a caveat alleging the same ground of fraud as Yusof. However, Hamidah failed in her attempt to extend the caveat whilst the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent successfully applied to recover possession of the land under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;89.;;">O 89 Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. Hamidah also sought to set aside the transfer of the land and to vest it in her name as the administratrix of the estate but her application failed. When the appellant became the administrator of the deceased's estate, he likewise applied for the same alleging similar grounds of fraud as previously alleged by Yusof and Hamidah. The learned judge dismissed his application on the grounds of limitation and <i>res judicata</i>. The appellant now appealed. The issues were (1) whether an action setting aside or challenging title to land under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the National Land Code ('NLC')</LINK> was subject to limitation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9 of the Limitation Act 1953 ('LA')</LINK>; (2) whether the period of limitation began to run when fraud was first alleged by Yusof; and (3) whether the principle of <i>res judicata</i> applied when the earlier applications and suits initiated by Yusof and Hamidah were dismissed on technical grounds and not on the merits of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">Section 2(4) of the LA</LINK> had the word "includes". When an interpretation section as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">s 2(4)</LINK> used the word "includes", it was <i>prima facie</i> extensive. It was a word of enlargement, to make the definition extensive and not restrictive. It would be incorrect to construe that an action to recover land under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(1) of the LA</LINK> would be only confined to possession of land. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">Section 2(1) of the LA</LINK> clearly stated that "land" included any legal or equitable estate or interest in land. If the court agreed with the appellant, the appropriate way of giving the land to him was for the court to make a declaration and to set aside the respondents' title, and a consequential order that the land be vested in the appellant's name as administrator of the estate. That essentially was an action to recover land within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(1)</LINK> and the period of limitation would be 12 years. (paras 20-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;341.;;">Section 341 of the NLC</LINK> provided that adverse possession, no matter how long, did not confer title to the land. Therefore, the registered proprietor or person entitled to the land, might at any time, take action to evict the stranger or squatter in adverse possession. Consequently, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;341.;;">s 341</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(2) of the LA</LINK>, in effect provided that there shall be no limitation period to bar the current registered proprietor from taking action. However, the present case could not come under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;341.;;">s 341</LINK>. The appellant, when he filed his claim, was not the registered proprietor of the land. As such, the respondents were not persons in adverse possession of the said land. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant's reliance on <i>Nasri v. Mesah</i> and <i>Tan Swee Lan v. Engku Nik Binti Engku Muda &amp; Ors</i> was misplaced. In both cases, the claims were based on specific performance of an agreement of sale of land. However, the appellant's action herein was to set aside or challenge a title based on allegation of fraud. Therefore, the applicable provision would be <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;29.;;">s 29 of the LA</LINK> which provided that time began to run upon the plaintiff having discovered the fraud or could have discovered it with reasonable diligence. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The 12-year limitation started to run from 24 November 1981, the date on which Yusof as the 1<sup>st</sup> administrator of the estate deposed allegation of fraud pertaining to the land in his private caveat. The action by the estate should begin to run at the earliest time when fraud could have been discovered, ie on 24 November 1981. Further, there was nothing to indicate that knowledge about the fraud was kept from the appellant. When the appellant filed the present action on 16 March 2005, limitation had already set it and his action was therefore statute-barred. (paras 28-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Hamidah had relied on the same facts and issues of alleged fraud to constitute her cause of action. The appellant being the current administrator of the estate was estopped by the principle of <i>res judicata</i> to institute the present case against the respondents pertaining to the land based on the same facts and issues of alleged fraud that had been adjudicated. Although the appellant was not a party to or was not involved in the previous three proceedings, the principle of <i>res judicata</i> was still applicable by virtue of him being a privy and current administrator of the estate. To allow the present case to sustain in light of three binding orders of the court was to condone an abuse of the process of the court. It would defeat public policy and public interest that there should be finality in litigation. In the circumstances, it was just that the appellant be bound by the outcome of the previous proceedings. (paras 39, 40, 41, 42 &amp; 46)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Antecedents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The genesis of the appeal concerned a dispute over a piece of land known as Lots 1800 and 1801, Mukim 12, Daerah Barat Daya, Pulau Pinang under Grant Nos 1121 and 1122 ('the said land'). The original proprietor was one Ibrahim bin Samat ('the deceased').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Sometime in 1979, the deceased had allegedly sold the said land to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> respondents and the registration was duly completed on 2 October 1979 ('the first transfer').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The deceased's grandson, Yusof bin Din ('Yusof'), became the administrator of the estate of the deceased via grant of letter of administration dated 7 April 1981. On 27 November 1981, Yusof lodged a private caveat on the said land and he alleged that the deceased could not be the vendor who sold the said land to the respondents as the deceased had passed away since 1945. The said caveat lapsed after six years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The deceased's granddaughter, Hamidah binti Din ('Hamidah'), became the administratrix of estate of the deceased via grant of letter of administration <i>de bonis</i> non dated 15 September 1987. She lodged a private caveat on the said land alleging the same ground of fraud as her late brother, Yusof, had alleged earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The parties then locked in litigation of marathon proportions. Hamidah applied to the Georgetown High Court vide Originating Summons No: 24-434- 1995 ('OS 434') to extend the private caveat. In her affidavit affirmed on 15 April 1995, the same ground of fraud was reiterated. However, the originating summons was dismissed by learned judge in chambers on 15 August 1995. She did not appeal against the said decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 19 October 1995, the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent transferred his 1/2 undivided share of the said land to the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent ('the second transfer').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent applied via Originating Summons No: 24-1094- 1995 ('OS1094') pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;89.;;">O 89 Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>, to recover possession of the said land. Hamidah resisted the application by filing an affidavit in reply deposing the same allegation of fraud. On 27 November 1997, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's application was allowed. Hamidah did not appeal against the said decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Pending the disposal of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;89.;;">O 89</LINK> application, Hamidah filed a writ at Georgetown High Court vide Civil Suit No: 22-246-1996 ('writ 246') against the respondents. She sought to set aside the transfer and to vest the said land in her name as the administratrix of the estate of the deceased. On 4 August 1997, the Senior Assistant Registrar set aside the said writ upon application made by the respondents. Hamidah's appeal to the judge in chambers was dismissed on 20 January 1998. There was no further appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 18 June 1996, the said land was charged to Public Bank by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant then became the administrator of the estate of the deceased via grant of letter of administration <i>de bonis non</i> dated 30 May 2006. The appellant and one Mansor bin Ahmad (since deceased) filed a writ vide Civil Suit No: 22-135-2006 against the respondents alleging the same grounds of fraud as previously alleged by Yusof and Hamidah. He sought to set aside the transfer and to vest the said land in his name as the administrator of the estate of the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> At the conclusion of the trial, the High Court dismissed the appellant's claim on two main grounds: (i) limitation, and (ii) <i>res judicata</i>. Hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Before us, the finding of the High Court was assailed by the appellant on the following grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and the respondents at some length and gone through the records available before us. In our view, the learned trial judge's decision did not suffer from any infirmity requiring interference by this court. Accordingly, we unanimously dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We now give the reasons for our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Parties' Respective Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> At the outset, it should be noted that the submissions advanced by the appellant before us were repetitions and in some instances an embellishment of the same submissions raised before the High Court. The learned trial judge had admirably dealt with all the points raised and rejected them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the plea of limitation by the respondents was misconceived. According to learned counsel, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(1) of the Limitation Act 1953 ("Act 254")</LINK> did not apply because the present appeal was not an action to recover land but to set aside the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's tittle and interest in the said land under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;40.;;">s 40(2) and (3) of the National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It was the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that the entire scheme under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Act 254</LINK> dealt with an action to recover land and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;15.;;">s 15 of the Act</LINK> made it clear that an action to recover land was actually an action to recover possession of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In support of the above contention, learned counsel relied on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">s 2(4) of Act 254</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> It was argued that the above section made no reference to the action of setting aside title of land or challenging title to land. The entire scheme under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Act 254</LINK> suggests that an action to recover the land includes an action to recover possession of land. Conversely, it was submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">subsections 340(2) and (3) of the NLC</LINK> encompassed an action specifically to set aside the title or interest of the person for the time being registered as proprietor of the land. Therefore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9 of Act 254</LINK> has no application to an action under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> With respect, the submission was devoid of any sound reasoning. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">Section 2(4) of Act 254</LINK> prefixed the interpretation therein with the word "includes". When an interpretation section uses the word "includes", it is <i>prima facie</i> extensive. It is used as a word of enlargement, to make the definition extensive and not restrictive. In <i>Bharat Coop Bank (Mumbai) Ltd v. Coop Bank Employees Union</i> [2007] II LLC 825, it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In similar vein, in <i>Commercial Taxation Officer, Udaipur v. Rajasthan Texchem Ltd</i> [2008] 12 STR 660, it was held:</p>
    <p>".... The word "includes" usually used in the interpretation clause in order to enlarge the meaning of the words in the statute. When the word "includes" used in the words or phrases, it must be construed as comprehending nor only such things as they signify according to their nature and impact but also those things which the interpretation clause declares they shall include ...."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In our considered opinion, it would be incorrect to construe that an action to recover land as stipulated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(1) of Act 254</LINK> would be only confined to possession of land. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;2.;;">Section 2(1) of Act 254</LINK> clearly states that 'land' includes any legal or equitable estate or interest in land. To put it colloquially, what the appellant says is this: 'the respondents are not entitled to the land and I want the land'. In the event the court agrees with appellant, the appropriate way of giving the land to him is for the court to make a declaration and set aside the respondents' title, and a consequential order that the land be vested in the appellant's name as administrator of the estate of the deceased. This is essentially an action to recover land within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(1) of Act 254</LINK>, and the period of limitation would be 12 years. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1958_1_56;"><i>Ponnusamy &amp; Anor v. Nathu Ram</i> [1958] 1 MLRH 56</LINK>; [1959] 1 MLJ 86).</p>

      <b>[23]</b> Another argument of the appellant was that the second part of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;341.;;">s 341 of the NLC</LINK> states that "and accordingly, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Limitation Act 1953</LINK>, shall in no circumstances operate to extinguish any title to, or interest in, land" shows that the period of limitation for recovery of land under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;;">Act 254</LINK> deals with adverse possession because adverse possession can extinguish title to, or interest in, land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The submission was bereft of any merit. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;341.;;">Section 341 of the NLC</LINK> provides that adverse possession, no matter how long, does not confer title to the land. Therefore, the registered proprietor or person entitled to the land, may at any time, take action to evict the stranger or squatter in adverse possession. Consequently, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;341.;;">s 341 of the NLC</LINK>, read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(2) of Act 254</LINK>, in effect provided that there shall be no limitation period to bar the current registered proprietor from taking action. However, the present case cannot come under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;341.;;">s 341 of the NLC</LINK>. The appellant, when he filed his claim, was not the registered proprietor of the land. As such, the respondents were not persons in adverse possession of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We now turn to the issue as to when the period of limitation begins. It was the appellant's contention that time only started to run from 18 April 1994, based upon a letter issued by Messrs Ban Eng Anual &amp; Foong (solicitors acting for the respondents at the material time) to Messrs Razak &amp; Co (solicitors acting for Hamidah), expressing the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's refusal to transfer the said land to the estate of the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The appellant made reference to the cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1970_1_363;"><i>Nasri v. Mesah</i> [1970] 1 MLRA 363</LINK>; [1971] 1 MLJ 32 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1973_1_422;"><i>Tan Swee Lan v. Engku Nik Binti Engku Muda &amp; Ors</i> [1973] 1 MLRA 422</LINK>; [1973] 2 MLJ 187 in which the Federal Court in both cases held that the period of limitation began to run from the first clear and unequivocal threat to the appellant's right to a transfer of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In our considered view, the appellant's reliance on both cases is misplaced. In both <i>Nasri (supra)</i> and <i>Tan Swee Lan (supra)</i>, the claimant's premised their claims on specific performance of an agreement of sale of land. However, the appellant's action herein is to set aside or challenge a title based on allegation of fraud. Therefore, the applicable provision would be <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;29.;;">s 29 of Act 254</LINK> which provides that time begins to run upon the plaintiff having discovered the fraud or could have discovered it with reasonable diligence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In the present appeal, the learned High Court Judge held that 12 year limitation started to run from 24 November 1981, being the date on which Yusof, as the first administrator of the estate of the deceased, deposed allegation of fraud pertaining to the said land in his private caveat. We found no cogent reason to disturb the trial judge's findings. His Lordship has properly appreciated the evidence on record and correctly interpreted the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Yusof, Hamidah and the appellant all represented the estate of the deceased. The grant of letter of administration to Yusof, and the grant of letters of administration de bonis non to Hamidah and the appellant, were to administer the right and interest of the said land. The action by the estate of the deceased should begin to run at the earliest time when fraud could have been discovered, ie on 24 November 1981. Further, there was nothing to indicate that knowledge about the fraud was kept from the appellant. When the appellant filed the present action on 16 March 2005, limitation has already set it and his action was therefore statute-barred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Therefore, the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant pertaining to the issue of limitation must fail.</p>
    <p>
      <i>
        <b>Res Judicata</b>
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The appellant contended that <i>res judicata</i> did not apply in the present case because none of the issues raised here have been adjudicated upon and decided on their merits in the three earlier cases relied on by the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In support of his contention, reference was made to the following passage from the Privy Council case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1963_1_343;"><i>Kok Hoong v. Leong Cheong Kweng Mines Ltd</i> [1963] 1 MLRA 343</LINK>; [l964] 1 MLJ 49 at p 350:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The appellant further contended that the learned trial judge erred by failing to appreciate that the three previous legal proceedings were disposed on grounds of technicality and not on its merits:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We began our discussion on the principle of <i>res judicata</i> by referring to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. The principle has been enshrined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;40.;;">s 40 of the Act</LINK>. The section precluded relitigation of a cause of action brought in a prior litigation. This basic principle of law was designed to prevent a losing party from getting multiple chances to litigate what was substantially the same case. <i>Res judicata</i> is considered a rule of fundamental and substantial justice, because it encourages reliance on judicial decisions, bars vexatious litigation, and frees courts to resolve other disputes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Perhaps, the principle in <i>Henderson v. Henderson</i> [1843] Hare 100, at p 115, was probably the commonest form of <i>res judicata</i> to come before our courts. The implications of that principle were examined by the House of Lords in <i>Arnold v. National Westminster Bank Plc</i> [1991] 2 AC 93, which is authority for the following propositions:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In <i>Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited (Respondent) v. Zodiac Seats UK Limited (formerly known as Contour Aerospace Limited) (Appellant)</i> [2013] UKSC 46, the Supreme Court of United Kingdom, in a judgment given by Lord Sumption, reviewed the law of <i>res judicata</i>. His Lordship considered that <i>res judicata</i> was a portmanteau term which was used to describe a number of different legal principles with different judicial origin:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[37]</b>
      <i>Halsbury's Law of England</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> edn, vol 16, para 1530; explained the principle of <i>res judicita</i> in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Applying the principles laid down in the above authorities to the factual matrix of the present case, we were of the considered opinion that the plea of issue of estoppel had been rightly upheld by the learned trial judge. The basis of the learned trial judge's decision on this issue was that the appellant was estopped from filing the present suit again for the estate of the deceased because Hamidah had earlier been involved in three previous proceedings for the said estate vide OS 434, writ 246 and OS 1094 where orders had been given with no appeal being filed by Hamidah. Hence, the appellant was <i>res judicata</i> to revise the same cause of action which involved the same allegation of fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We agreed with the reasoning of the learned trial judge. It was not in dispute that Hamidah had relied on the same facts and issues of alleged fraud to constitute her cause of action in OS 434 and writ 246 and to resist the appellant's application for summary possession in OS 1094. Therefore, the appellant being the current administrator of the estate of the deceased was estopped by the principle of <i>res judicata</i> to institute the present case against appellant pertaining to the said land based on the same facts and issues of alleged fraud which had been adjudicated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Granted that the appellant was not a party to or was involved in the previous three proceedings but the principle of <i>res judicata</i> was still applicable to him by virtue of him being a privy and current administrator of the estate of the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It is accepted that the same parties (<i>idem actor</i>) requirement for a successful reliance on <i>res judicata</i> does not mean identical parties but included their privies such as a deceased and his heirs, a principal and his agent, a person under curatorship and his curator, a pupil and his tutor, a creditor and debtor in respect of a pledged article if the debtor gave article in pledge after losing a suit which a third party claimed it, a purchaser and seller, if the seller has won or lost the action (See <i>Amalgamated Engineering Union v. Minister of Labour</i> [1949] (3) SA 637 at p 654).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In our considered opinion, the question as to whether persons who are in law identified with those who are parties in two or more sets of proceedings should depend upon the facts of each case and should not only apply to the specific person or persons against whom judgment had been obtained. The "same parties" requirement was not immutable and may in appropriate case be relaxed or adapted to address new factual situation that a court may face. The principle of <i>res judicata</i> is founded on the policy considerations that there should be finality in litigation and avoidance of a multiplicity of litigation or conflicting judicial decisions on the same issue or issues. Rigid adherence to the requirement of the same parties would defeat the purpose of <i>res judicita</i>.</p>

      <b>[43]</b> In the <i>South African case of Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd v. World of Marble and Granite 2000 CC &amp; Other</i> [2013] (6) SA 499, Willis JA said at para 43:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In <i>Resolution Chemicals Ltd v. H Lundbeck A-S</i> [2013] EWCA Civ 924, the United Kingdom's court clarified the position of "privity of interest", which provides an exception to the general rule of estoppel that only original parties are bound. Lord Justice Floyd concluded from a review of the case law on privity of interest that:</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We agreed with the decision of the learned trial judge when His Lordship held that to allow the present case to sustain in the light of three binding orders of the court was to condone an abuse of the process of the court and to defeat public policy and public interest that there should be finality in litigation. We hasten to add that, in the circumstances of the present case, it was just that the appellant be bound by the outcome of the previous proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In the result, the appeal was dismissed with costs fixed at RM10,000.00 and the order of the High Court affirmed. Deposit was refunded to the appellant.</p>
