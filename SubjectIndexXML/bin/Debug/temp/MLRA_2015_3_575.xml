    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>Pursuant to a Margin Trading Agreement ("MA"), the plaintiff had granted Dunia Dimensi Sdn Bhd ("DD") a Margin Facility. Subsequently, a Novation Agreement ("NA") was entered into between DD, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the plaintiff whereby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant assumed all of DD's obligations and liabilities under the MA and undertook to repay all sums due and owing by DD to the plaintiff under the MA with interest ('the Redemption Sum'), on the consideration that DD would transfer all of its shares in one Putera Capital Berhad ("PCB") to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also entered into a Repayment Agreement ("RA") with the plaintiff wherein the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant agreed to settle the Redemption Sum in the manner therein. By a Letter of Guarantee and Indemnity, the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants jointly and severally agreed to pay the plaintiff inter alia, all sums due and owing by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the plaintiff under the NA and RA. The plaintiff claimed the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant failed to pay and thus sued to recover from the defendants all sums due and owing. The defendants contended that there was in existence a collateral contract to the NA and the RA and the guarantee executed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant argued that the plaintiff had also breached the terms of the collateral contract and submitted that it was a condition precedent to any liability on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that approval had to be obtained from the Bursa Saham Malaysia Bhd for the transfer of the PCB shares to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Since such condition was not performed, the plaintiff could not seek to enforce the agreements. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, alleging loss due to the plaintiff's negligence in dealing with the PCB shares, counterclaimed for loss and damages. The High Court allowed the plaintiff's claim and rejected the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's counterclaim. Hence, the present appeal by the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> An appellate court would be loath to interfere with the findings of facts made by the judge at a trial save and except in exceptional circumstances. However, in the instant case, the learned judge had failed to properly evaluate the evidence before the court to establish the existence of a collateral contract as pleaded by the appellants. Appellate intervention was warranted despite the High Court's findings of fact. (paras 24-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Based on the evidence, there was credible and sufficient evidence of inducement, persuasion and assurance given by the plaintiff which constituted the collateral contract prior to the execution of the RA, the NA and the guarantee. The High Court judge based her judgment on the four corners of the existing agreements but failed to appreciate the evidence that was before the court in respect of the collateral contract. The important question that the judge should have asked herself was if the arrangement under the restructuring exercise was not in place, would the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the other defendants have signed the RA, the NA and the guarantee. The evidence pointed to the fact that they signed these agreements with the plaintiff because of the assurances given by the plaintiff to the defendants under the restructuring exercise. It would be incredulous for the defendants to agree to take over the liabilities if not for assurances under the restructuring exercise. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court judge had also failed to take into account that the evidence pointed to the plaintiff being fully aware of the collateral arrangement and participating in it as advisor of the restructuring exercise to earn a hefty fee. (para 35)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The facts forming the background to this appeal before us have been elucidated quite succinctly in the grounds of Her Ladyship, the learned judge and we have precise it in our present judgment. For ease of reference we shall refer to the parties as plaintiff and defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The plaintiff is a licensed bank incorporated in Malaysia and carries on the business of banking. By a Vesting Order dated 28 December 2006 issued by the High Court at Kuala Lumpur vide an ex parte Originating Summons No: D4-24-429-2006, the entire business of Kuala Lumpur City Securities Sdn Bhd (Company No 126994-W) ("KLCS") including all of its rights, assets and obligations were transferred to and vested in the plaintiff in its entirety, effective 30 December 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Pursuant to a Letter of Offer dated 24 March 2004 and Margin Trading Facility Agreement dated 24 March 2004 ("the said Margin Agreement"), the plaintiff granted to Dunia Dimensi Sdn Bhd ("Dunia Dimensi") a Margin Facility with a maximum principal limit of RM6,000,000.00 ("the said Margin Facility") based on the terms and conditions contained in the said Margin Agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> A Novation Agreement dated 23 August 2006 ("NA") was entered into between Dunia Dimensi, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the plaintiff whereby the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant assumed all of Dunia Dimensi's obligations and liabilities under the said Margin Agreement and also undertook to repay all sums due and owing by Dunia Dimensi to the plaintiff under the Margin Agreement with interest ("the Redemption Sum") and as consideration thereof, Dunia Dimensi would transfer all 13,849,500 of its shares in Putera Capital Berhad ("the PCB Shares") to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> A Repayment Agreement dated 23 August 2006 ("RA") was entered into between the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant whereby the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant agreed <i>inter alia</i> that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would settle the Redemption Sum in the manner stated therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> By a Letter of Guarantee and Indemnity dated 23 August 2006 ("the Guarantee") the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants had, upon the consideration contained therein, agreed jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiff upon demand, all sums due and owing by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to the plaintiff under the said NA and the said RA including interest, commissions, fee and legal costs up to the maximum principal sum of RM7,500,000.00 subject to the terms and conditions contained therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Despite numerous demands and indulgences as pleaded in the statement of claim, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had failed to settle the sums due and owing to the plaintiff under the said NA and the said RA amounting to RM4,174,976.15 as at 3 October 2008. The plaintiff 's claim in its action against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is for the sum of RM4,174,976.15 as at 3 October 2008 with continuing interest as sums due and owing. The plaintiff 's claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> defendants is based on their liability under their respective guarantees.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff's claim against the defendants was for debts due and accruing from the Margin Facility between the plaintiff and Dunia Dimensi. The plaintiff, through its solicitors sent a Letter of Demand dated 26 February 2007 demanding for the repayment of the loan. The plaintiff claims that up till 13 February 2008, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant only made part payment of RM515,635.19. Letters were sent by the defendants seeking indulgence from the plaintiff as to the delay in repaying the loan.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The plaintiff claims that the cheques did not satisfy the debt and/or the defendants did not follow the proposal that was agreed upon. The plaintiff returned the cheques and proceeded to sell all the balance PCB Shares amounting to RM2,922,542.31 to satisfy part of the debt due.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Thereafter, the plaintiff through its solicitors sent another Letter of Demand to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on 23 October 2008 and to the 2<sup>nd</sup> till 4<sup>th</sup> defendants (as guarantors) on 4 November 2008, for the balance debt still due and accruing but the defendants failed and/or neglected to satisfy the debts. As such, the plaintiff, through this suit, claims for debts due and accruing amounting to the sum of RM4,174,976.15 together with interest and cost.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The plaintiff denies the existence of any collateral contract as alleged by the defendants and further contends that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has admitted its liability to the plaintiff under the said NA as well as the RA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant contends that Patrick Soh Kim Ngiap (Patrick) the Executive Director of Operations of KLCS, (now the plaintiff) in or about March 2006, approached Datuk Chang Kok Chuang (the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, a Director of Right Development Activities Sdn Bd (RDA) to be the white knight earmarked by AMBB to rehabilitate PCB, under a proposed restructuring exercise. It was further contended that certain representations were made by Patrick to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The representations were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> By reason of the matters set out above, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant contends that there was in existence a collateral contract to the NA, RA and the guarantee between the plaintiff and the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Beside on the existence of the above representations, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also contends that there were salient terms of the Collateral Contract and the terms were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Acting upon and in reliance upon the purported representations by KLCS/ plaintiff and based on the Collateral Contract, the defendants contend that they were induced to enter and execute the NA, RA as well as the Guarantee. It is also the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's contention that the plaintiff has acted in breach of the Collateral Contract by reason of, <i>inter alia</i>;</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Alternatively, it is contended, that by the NA and RA, it was a condition precedent to any liability on the part of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that approval is obtained from Bursa Saham Malaysia Berhad for the transfer of the PCB Shares to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. However, the said condition was not performed since the Bursa's approval was not obtained. By that token it follows, the plaintiff cannot now seek to enforce the aforesaid agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As a consequence of the improper sale of the PCB Shares by the plaintiff, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has suffered loss and damage and claims for damages for conversion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In its counter claim, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant claims that the plaintiff had negligently, recklessly and/or were guilty of <i>mala fide</i> when it failed to make the most of the security in the PCB Shares to the best of advantage and/or to the material prejudice of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. It is contended by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that as at 17 March 2008, the PCB Shares were worth RM3,739,365.00 (the Security Value), and that the plaintiff could have realised the said sum in settlement of the alleged outstanding amount. As a result of the plaintiff 's negligence, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has been deprived its rights to redeem the PCB Shares, and accordingly now are claiming for loss and damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Dunia Dimensi was granted the said Margin Facility which it used to acquire 13,849,500 shares of PCB (PCB Shares). In about the year 2005, Dunia Dimensi was unable to repay the Margin Facility with interest accrued thereon and had been deemed non performing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The plaintiff entered into discussions with the 5<sup>th</sup> defendant to act as the phrase is commonly known in commercial parlance "the white knight" in a corperate restructure of PCB. The initial plan was for the loan of Dunia Dimensi loan to be repaid and PCB rehabilitated and a reverse takeover of PCB by the 5<sup>th</sup> appellant. To this end, several meetings were held between the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, PW2 and PW3 (see evidence of PW3 at pp 449-450 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(2) Bahagian B).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant was advised by the plaintiff for the takeover of PCB to inject construction projects worth RM300 Million into PCB. In the spirit of this proposed corporate restructure exercise, on the 7 June 2005, the plaintiff wrote a mandate letter to PCB to offer advice on the corperate exercise and to act as advisor for a fee. It stands to reason to act a "white knight" this letter would not have been issued if not for the existence of these collateral terms (mandate letter found in pp 932-942 Rekod Rayuan Bahagian C, see also Q&amp;A4 and Q&amp;A5 at pp 431-432 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2 Bahagian B).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The aforesaid evidence in relation to the collateral contract as pleaded by the appellants were before the learned judge but the learned judge chose to confine herself to the four corners of the Novation Agreement, the Repayment Agreement and the guarantees and since these documents made no reference to the collateral contract, the learned judge rejected the argument of a collateral contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We are well aware that an appellate court would be loath to interfere with the findings of facts made by the learned judge at a trial save except in exceptional circumstances, however we find that the learned judge had failed to properly evaluate the body of evidence before the court to establish the existence of a collateral contract as pleaded by the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We therefore find that this case decries appellate intervention despite the High Court findings of fact, and reference is made to the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_1;"><i>Gan Yook Chin &amp; Anor v. Lee Ing Chin &amp; Ors</i> reported in [2004] 2 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 1; [2004] 4 CLJ 309; [2004] 6 AMR 781 where it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Turning to the issue of the existence of a collateral contract being in existence as pleaded by the appellants, the law on the same has developed over period of a time and the Federal Court's decision in the case <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_71;"><i>Tan Swee Hoe Co Ltd v. Ali Hussain Bros</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 71</LINK>; [1980] 1 MLJ 89 is referred wherein the Federal Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The above case is applicable in our case. I also refer to the judgment of His Royal Highness Raja Azlan Shah CJ (as His Highness then was) and I quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> This decision was referred to with approval by the Privy Council in the case of <i>His Royal Highness Prince Jefri Bolkiah and Others v. The State of Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Investment Agency</i> [2007] UKPC 63, we refer particularly to the judgment of Lord Mance at paras 47 and 48 and I quote.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Having evaluated the evidence that was before us as we are entitled to do it is quite clear that the respondent had invited the appellants to enter into a proposed restructuring exercise, wherein the pledge of shares of PCB, to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would be redeemed by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and in return PCB would be restructured, removed from PN 17 status and by virtue of the reverse takeover the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would be in control in PCB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is inconceivable in our view that the appellants would have agreed to enter into such an arrangement if not for the restructuring exercise, bearing in mind the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was never the original borrower of the said loan. It is also erstwhile to note that the respondent had caused itself to be appointed as an advisor for the proposed restructuring exercise and was to earn a fee of RM600,000.00. (See Yeong Sook Fun's (PW1) evidence under crossexamination at lines 293-404 of pp 371-372 of Jilid 2(1) Bahagian B of Rekod Rayuan).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The restructuring exercise would require Securities Commission's (SC) approval and that of other regulatory authorities and while this was pending, interest only was to be serviced and it is not a disputed fact the interest was serviced.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We also find that the repayment agreement, the novation agreement and the guarantee are linked to the success of the corporate restructuring and it is a condition precedent to liability under these three agreements. (See evidence of Yeong Sook Fun at p 358 Rekod Rayuan 2(1) Bahagian B at lines 225- 233).</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The respondent through its nominees proceeded under this restricting exercise to apply for the SC's approval (at pp 1004-1042 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2(5) Bahagian C). On 28 May 2007, the SC finally rejected the restructuring exercise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Based on all aforesaid evidence, we find there is credible and sufficient evidence of inducement, persuasion and assurance given by the plaintiff which constituted the Collateral Contract prior to the execution of the Repayment Agreement, Novation Agreement and guarantee. The learned High Court Judge based her judgment on the four corners of the existing agreements. The learned trial judge in our view failed to appreciate the evidence that was before the court in respect of the Collateral Contract. The important question that the learned judge should have asked herself is if the arrangement under restructuring exercise were not in place, would the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant have signed the Novation Agreement, the Repayment Agreement and the guarantees. In our view the evidence points to the fact that they signed these agreements which in effect means a taking over of Dunia Dimensi liability with the plaintiff because of the assurances given by the plaintiff to the defendants under the restructuring exercise. It would be incredulous for the defendants to agree take over these liabilities if not for assurances under the restructuring exercise. In fact PW1 made it clear in her evidence that the Repayment Agreement is related and dependant on the successful restructuring of PCB. Since that restructuring has been rejected by the SC, the appellants could not have been liable by the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The learned judge also failed to take into account that the evidence pointed to the plaintiff being fully aware of this collateral arrangement and participating in them as advisor of the restructuring exercise was to earn a hefty fee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> For the aforesaid reasons we find there is merit in this appeal and the court on the upshot orders:</p>
