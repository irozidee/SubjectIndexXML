    <p>The appellant was charged with trafficking in 419.7 grams of drugs (methamphetamine) under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("DDA")</LINK>. He was arrested at the airport with the drugs found secretly concealed in a side compartment of his bag. At the close of the prosecution's case, the High Court found that a prima facie case had been established and ordered the appellant to enter his defence. The appellant elected to give unsworn evidence from the dock. At the end of the prosecution's case, the High Court found that the appellant had failed to raise any reasonable doubt against the prosecution's case and convicted him on the charge thereon. He was sentenced to death and appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal; appellant acquitted and discharged:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The burden to prove the existence of knowledge on the part of the appellant of the drugs found in the bag remained squarely on the prosecution. The appellant made reference to three persons in his version of events and in his statement from the dock to support his contention that he lacked knowledge of the presence of drugs in the bag. The trial judge misdirected herself in placing the burden on the appellant to disprove that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs being in the bag by requiring the appellant to call those three persons to testify on the appellant's behalf. This would amount to a serious misdirection in law which would render the conviction unsafe. <i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP (refd)</i>; <i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. PP (refd)</i>. (paras 8, 10, 13, &amp; 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge had misdirected herself when she failed to appreciate adequately the defence of the appellant. The trial judge should have evaluated the evidence against the prosecution's case to find whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption of knowledge and whether the defence had raised reasonable doubt. The trial judge seemed to have completely dismissed the appellant's defence as an afterthought simply because his evidence could not be challenged by the prosecution and therefore carried minimal weight as compared to the evidence of an accused person tested under cross-examination. <i>Mohd Nazri Omar &amp; Ors v. PP (refd)</i>. (para 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The trial judge had failed to consider the appellant's evidence at all. It was incumbent for the trial judge to consider the whole of the evidence objectively and from all angles. In that way, the appellant would have a fair chance of being acquitted. All aspects of the defence must be adequately and judicially considered by the trial judge. This was not done in the instant case. (paras 20-21)</p>

      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged with trafficking in 419.7 grams of methamphetamine under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("DDA")</LINK>. He was convicted and sentenced under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the DDA</LINK>. Aggrieved, the appellant now appeals to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The charge against the appellant was as follows:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The prosecution had called 12 witnesses to testify. At the end of the prosecution's case, the learned trial judge found a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant and ordered the appellant to enter his defence. The appellant elected to give unsworn evidence from the dock.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At the end of the defence case, the learned judge found that the appellant had failed to raise any reasonable doubt against the prosecution's case and consequently the appellant was convicted in respect of the said charge and sentenced to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Briefly, the factual scenario which led to the arrest of the appellant on 1 January 2011 were as follows:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judge found the appellant had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case and proceeded to find him guilty. The learned trial judge reasoned that:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The written submissions of the appellant focus mainly on the knowledge on the part of the appellant and not possession, and our analysis of the appellant's case proceeds accordingly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The burden to prove the existence of knowledge on the part of the appellant of the drugs found in the bag remains squarely on the prosecution. We refer to the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311 where the court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The case of <i>Warner v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i> [1968] 2 All ER 356, set some guidelines which have been followed in many jurisdictions including ours. In particular, Lord Wilberforce stated:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Discerning from the proved facts of this instant appeal one will see thatthe appellant has made reference to three persons namely Farshad, Akbar and Mahmud, in his version of the events that took place that would go to support the appellant's contention that the appellant lacked the knowledge of the presence of the drugs in the bag. The Public Prosecutor had re-examined the Investigating Officer, Inspector Eddy Amin bin Hussin Ala (SP10), on these names during the investigation of the case. SP10's evidence at p 183 of the Appeal Record (herein after referred to "AR") vol 2 as set out below confirms that:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> This version of the appellant has also been referred in his unsworn statement from the dock. The gist of the appellant's case was that the bag was given to him before he travelled to Malaysia by Akbar. This can be inferred from the appellant's evidence which can be found at pp 226-227 of the AR vol 3:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The drugs were placed in a part of the bag where it could not have been easily discovered. SP4's evidence that can be found at pp 39-40 of the AR vol 1.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> As it stands, it points to lack of knowledge on the part of the appellant. The learned trial judge, in our view, misdirected herself in placing the burden on the appellant to disprove that the appellant had knowledge of the drugs being in the bag by requiring the appellant to call these three persons to testify on the appellant's behalf. We reproduce the judgment of the learned judge on this matter as below:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Following the Federal Court's case referred to aforesaid, this would amount to a serious misdirection in law which would render the conviction unsafe. We refer to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_47;">Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. PP [1996] 1 MLRA 47</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 209; [1996] 1 CLJ 705; [1996] 1 AMR 817 and to the judgment of His Lordship Edgar Joseph Jr FCJ where His Lordship said as follows:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> With regards to the unsworn evidence of the appellant (at pp 220-233 of the AR vol 3) which he chose to give from the dock, the learned judge had this to say:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We refer to the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_416;"><i>Azahan Mohd Aminallah v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 416</LINK>; [2005] 1 CLJ 374, where Gopal Sri Ram JCA decided that:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The decision in the case above had been referred to in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2014_208;"><i>Mohd Nazri Omar &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [2014] MLRAU 208</LINK> where it is decided that:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Thus, with reference to the aforesaid cases, the learned trial judge had misdirected herself when she failed to appreciate adequately the defence of the appellant. The learned trial judge should have evaluated the evidence against the prosecution's case to find whether the appellant had rebutted the presumption of knowledge and as a whole a reasonable doubt had been raised by the defence. The learned trial judge seemed to have completely dismissed the appellant's defence as an afterthought simply because his evidence could not be challenged by the prosecution and therefore carried minimal weight as compared to the evidence of an accused person which was tested under crossexamination. The appellant's unsworn statement ought not to be altogether brushed aside but the evidence should be taken into account along with other evidence in the case (see <i>Joseph John Callaghan</i> [1977] 64 Cr App R 11).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned trial judge in this instant appeal failed to give due weight to the following facts raised by the appellant which were:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It was the appellant's first visit to Malaysia and he was supposed to be accompanied by Mahmud, who had been abandoned in his travelling plans halfway. His conduct of looking to his left and right at the airport can also be inferred as the appellant being unsure of the new environment. The learned trial judge failed to weigh these factors together. It is evident that the learned trial judge had failed to consider the appellant's evidence at all.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is incumbent for the learned trial judge to consider the whole of the evidence objectively and from all angles. In that way, the appellant would have a fair chance of being acquitted. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_227;"><i>Gooi Loo Seng v. PP</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 227</LINK>; [1993] 2 MLJ 137;  [1993] 3 CLJ 1; [1993] 2 AMR 1135 at p 229). Put in another way, all aspects of the defence must be adequately and judicially considered by the trial judge and this was not donen this instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> At this juncture, it is instructive to reproduce the speech of Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was), delivered in the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore in the case of <i>Neville v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1992] 1 SLR 153, at p 161:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Whilst the court is aware and takes cognisance of the modus of a person like the appellant who come to Malaysia, and the need for relevant authorities to be vigilant so as to ensure that our nation does not become a haven for 'drug tourism', that must be done to the required standard of proof for a criminal trial, ie proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Having perused the grounds of judgment of the learned trial judge, we find that the learned judge had misdirected herself in law. The learned judge failed to give due credence to the evidence of SD2 and SD3 and outrightly rejecting the same as an afterthought of the defence. Therefore, under these circumstances, we allowed the appeal and the decision of the High Court be set aside and the appellant be acquitted and discharged forthwith.</p>
