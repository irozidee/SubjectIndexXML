    <p>The plaintiff was examined and diagnosed by the 1st defendant as having a spinal condition known as "Adolescent Scoliosis". The 1st defendant advised the plaintiff and her parents that surgery would be the best option for her since her condition would only worsen with time. The plaintiff and her parents agreed to the elective surgery as proposed by the 1st defendant. A surgery was re-scheduled to 30 August 2005 and on that same day the plaintiff's father executed a standard consent form ("D25") given by the hospital. However, during the surgery, pedicle screws inserted into the plaintiff's vertebrae impinged into her spinal cord and despite a second surgery to remove the screws, the plaintiff suffered paralysis. After intensive physiotherapy sessions, the plaintiff regained her ability to walk with a slight limp but even until the date of judgment, she had not regained control over bladder or bowel movements. The plaintiff sued the 1st defendant for negligence in her treatment and the 2nd defendant for vicarious liability. During trial in the High Court, the 1st defendant testified that he had operated on the plaintiff using a "wake-up" test instead of using a monitoring machine known as the SSEP. The 1st defendant was not challenged by the plaintiff's counsel on his decision not to use the SSEP. The High Court was of the view that since the failure to use the SSEP was not pleaded, this failure was a non-issue. Further, since the 1st defendant's failure to use the SSEP was not challenged by the plaintiff's counsel, the issue ought not be considered by the court. The High Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim with costs, resulting in her appeal to the Court of Appeal. The following two issues were canvassed for the Court of Appeal's determination, viz: (i) whether the 1st defendant was negligent when conducting the surgery on the plaintiff; and (ii) whether there was a failure by the defendants to inform the plaintiff or her parents of the risk of paralysis, prior to obtaining their consent to the surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal was unable to agree with the trial court on the argument that the SSEP was never pleaded. In trying to explain to the court that there was no negligence, it was the 1st defendant who had raised the issue about the non-usage of the SSEP. It was also not fatal for the plaintiff's case that the 1st defendant was not cross-examined on his decision not to use the SSEP monitoring machine as the 1st defendant had already admitted in his examination-in-chief that he did not use the SSEP during the surgery. (paras 33-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In <i>Foo Fio Na v. Dr Soo Fook Mun &amp; Anor ("Foo Fio Na")</i>, the Federal Court adopted the Australian High Court decision in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> which decided inter alia that whether an act complained of amounts to negligence or not is to be decided by the court, and not the medical profession. Although this principle was confined in <i>Foo Fio Na</i> to a doctor's duty and standard of care in the field of providing advice to a patient on the inherent risks of a proposed treatment, the <i>Foo Fio Na</i> decision ought to apply in the area of not just medical advice but also to diagnosis and treatment. Thus the test of the standard of care expected of a medical professional in the realm of diagnosis and treatment should be a matter of judicial determination as opposed to medical judgment. (paras 37-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, it was clear that the paralysis was caused by the implantation of the pedicle screws by the 1st defendant during the first surgery which impinged on the plaintiff's spinal cord. Thus, an inference could be made that the 1st defendant was negligent in carrying out the surgery. The issue that followed was whether the 1st defendant had, by evidence, established that notwithstanding having caused injury to the plaintiff's spinal cord, he was in no way liable in negligence towards the plaintiff. On the evidence, the defendants had failed to discharge the evidential burden imposed upon them by law by satisfying the court that the 1st defendant had taken all precautions during surgery to avoid injuring the plaintiff's spinal cord. On the contrary, there was damaging evidence by the 1st defendant himself that showed he had failed to take all precautions to avoid injuring the plaintiff's spinal cord during surgery. (paras 40-49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The 1st defendant had failed to adhere to the standard of care expected of a surgeon like him. The 1st defendant failed to explain that he did all that was within his capacity as a medical man to ensure that the plaintiff's spinal cord was not injured by the surgery. His decision not to use the SSEP, especially when he was well appraised with the plaintiff's condition and knew that the plaintiff with her unique spinal deformity had a higher risk of suffering complications during surgery, showed gross negligence on his part. Due to the plaintiff's medical condition, there was all the more reason that the SSEP was necessary and should have been used by the 1st defendant during the surgery. The evidence, when taken in totality, was adequate to hold the 1st defendant liable in negligence. (paras 54-55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The High Court's approach to the issue of whether the plaintiff and her parents were informed of the risk of paralysis prior to consenting to surgery downplayed the importance and purpose of the consent form, as well as the importance of the duty to warn patients of the inherent risks of the proposed treatment. Such a liberal approach was also open to abuse by medical practitioners. The plaintiff in the instant case had successfully proven that the defendants had failed to inform her and her parents of the risk of paralysis. (paras 69-70)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The High Court judge erred when she made an assumption that just because the 1% risk of mortality had been informed to the plaintiff and her father, therefore the risk of paralysis, which was real and inherent in the surgery for scoliosis, must have been informed to the plaintiff and her parents. In the absence of any documentary evidence in support of the defendants' case that the risk of paralysis had been informed, the High Court judge should not have made any assumptions and arrived at such a simplistic conclusion. (para 71)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The 1st defendant was guilty of negligence in carrying out the surgery and was also negligent in failing to inform the plaintiff and her parents of the inherent risk of paralysis. Consequently, the 2nd defendant was found to be vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1st defendant. (para 72)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appeal before us emanates from the decision of the High Court of Penang, namely, the decision in Penang High Court Civil Suit No: 22-518-2008.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appeal is by the plaintiff (the appellant before us) against the decision of the learned High Court Judge dated 9 November 2012 dismissing the plaintiff's claim with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiff's claim in the High Court was for damages arising from medical negligence alleged to have been committed by the 1st defendant (the 1st respondent in this court) while treating the plaintiff. The claim against the 2nd defendant (the 2nd respondent) is on the basis of vicariously liability for the negligence by the 1st defendant, its employee at the material time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 21 July 2014 we allowed the plaintiff's appeal with costs and set aside the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Our decision was unanimous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We now give our grounds for allowing the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We will begin by setting out briefly the facts of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff was an active girl in sports, having represented her state, Penang, in athletics, in numerous competitions, including SUKMA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Her medical condition first came to light in the year 2003 when her athletics coach noticed that her back was unnaturally curved and advised her to seek treatment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The plaintiff was 14 years old at that time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The plaintiff first sought treatment at the Penang General Hospital and was later referred by the Penang General Hospital for further treatment to Pusat Perubatan Universiti Malaya, the 2nd defendant (hereinafter referred to as "the hospital"). At the hospital, the plaintiff met the 1st defendant (DW1), an Orthopedic Surgeon, together with one Dr Ng Swee Soon (DW7), at the former's clinic on 3 October 2003. The plaintiff was accompanied by her parents for the visit and for all subsequent visits at the hospital.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The 1st defendant examined the plaintiff and she was diagnosed as having a condition known as "Adolescent Scoliosis", a spinal deformity which leads to the spinal cord curving. The 1st defendant decided to monitor the plaintiff's spinal cord condition and she was given a new appointment date.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The plaintiff came back for her medical appointment with the 1st defendant as scheduled on 19 March 2004. By then, the 1st defendant noticed that the plaintiff's spinal cord had curved further as compared to her last visit. The 1st defendant advised the plaintiff and her parents that surgery would be the best option for the plaintiff, taking into account the fact that the plaintiff was reaching maturity and that her spinal condition would only continue to worsen with time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The plaintiff and her parents agreed to have the elective surgery proposed by the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The surgery was initially scheduled on 11 January 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> As the plaintiff was a minor, consent for the surgery was given by her mother on 10 January 2005 by executing the standard consent form provided by the hospital (exh D23).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> However, the surgery could not be performed as scheduled as the hospital was experiencing high volume of patients at the time and did not have a bed at the Intensive Care Unit to accommodate the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The plaintiff was sent home and the surgery was re-scheduled to 30 August 2005. This time, a similar consent form as the one executed by the plaintiff's mother, was executed by the plaintiff's father on 30 August 2005 (exh D25).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The 1st defendant performed the surgery on 30 August 2005. The 1st defendant provided a detailed explanation during examination-in-chief of how the surgery was performed. According to the 1st defendant, the surgery was done by inserting eight pedicle screws into the plaintiff's vertebrae. Prior to that, the 1st defendant had identified the exact positions for the insertion of the pedicle screws with the help of a fluoroscopy machine. After inserting the pedicle screws, the 1st defendant performed what is known as a wake up test, a nerve monitoring system, whereby the plaintiff was instructed to move her hands and legs, to ensure that all her limbs were functioning well. According to the 1st defendant, the plaintiff was able to move her hands but not her ankles. The 1st defendant suspected that the pedicle screws could have impinged into her spinal cord.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Nevertheless, the 1st defendant concluded the surgery and the plaintiff was stitched up.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> A computerised tomography scan, or more commonly known as a "CT scan", was carried out on the plaintiff immediately thereafter. The CT scan confirmed the 1st defendant's suspicion, for it revealed that the pedicle screws had impinged the plaintiff's spinal cord and was the cause of the plaintiff being immobile in her lower abdomen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The 1st defendant made the decision to remove all the pedicle screws from the plaintiff's vertebrae, and on the same day, the 1st defendant together with two other doctors, conducted a second surgery and removed all the pedicle screws from the plaintiff's vertebrae.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Unfortunately, even after the second surgery, the plaintiff was unable to move her lower limbs and suffered paralysis. With intense physiotherapy sessions, she regained her ability to walk, albeit with a limp. However, to date, she has no control over her bladder or bowel movements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The plaintiff filed a suit in the Penang High Court against the defendants, contending that the 1st defendant was negligent for failing to treat her adequately. Since the 1st defendant was an employee at the hospital at the material time, the hospital was sued on the basis of being vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> At the High Court, the learned judge held that the plaintiff had failed to prove negligence against the 1st defendant, and as such dismissed the plaintiff's claim against the defendants with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Hence this appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Before us, two issues were canvassed for our determination, and they are summarised as below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>First Issue: Whether The 1st Defendant Was Negligent When Performing The Surgery On The Plaintiff ?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> On the first issue, it is the plaintiff's contention that the 1st defendant was negligent in treating her during surgery. The plaintiff's case is premised on the fact that the 1st defendant, in performing the surgery on the plaintiff, caused the pedicle screws to impinge on into her spinal cord, thereby resulting her paralysis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The defendants deny that there was any negligence on the part of the 1st defendant when carrying out the surgery to implant the pedicle screws. Learned counsel for the 1st defendant contends that the 1st defendant had carried out the surgery using acceptable surgical procedure and as such the 1st defendant was not negligent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> During examination-in-chief, the 1st defendant testified that he had conducted the surgery on the plaintiff using the wake up test, instead of a monitoring machine known as "Somatosensory Evoked Potential" (SSEP). Learned counsel for the 1st defendant contends that, based on the evidence of the defendants' expert witness, Dato' Dr Fazir Mohamed (DW5), Head of the Orthopedic Department, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, at the material time in 2005, the wake up test which was used by the 1st defendant was an acceptable monitoring method. However, it was asserted by the defendants, that usage of the SSEP was at its infancy stage in Malaysia and that the 1st defendant had exercised his clinical judgment carefully by deciding to proceed with the wake up test.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> It is the defendants' contention that the failure of the 1st defendant to use the SSEP was not pleaded, hence a non-issue in this case. The 1st defendant was not challenged by the plaintiff's counsel on his decision not to use the SSEP during surgery. As such, this issue should not be considered by this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The learned High Court Judge agreed with the defendants, and held that the issue on the non-usage of the SSEP was never pleaded by the plaintiff. The learned judge held as follows (at p 37 of the Grounds of Judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> With due respect, we are unable to agree with the learned trial judge on the argument that the SSEP was never pleaded. Once an inference of negligence can be made, it is incumbent upon the 1st defendant to explain that there was no breach of duty of care. In trying to explain to the court that there was no negligence, it was the 1st defendant who raised the issue about the non-usage of the SSEP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We also find that it is not fatal for the plaintiff's case that the 1st defendant was not cross-examined on his decision not to use the SSEP monitoring as the 1st defendant had already admitted in his examination-in-chief that he did not use the SSEP during the surgery. This also had been confirmed by the evidence of DW5, the defendant's expert witness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> At common law, a doctor is said to owe a duty of care to his patient who is under his care, and this duty arises out of his relationship with his patient. Refer to the case of <i>R Bateman</i> [1925] 94 LBKB 79.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In determining the standard of care expected of a doctor, the legal position had been laid down in the English case of <i>Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee</i> [1957] 2 All ER 118 where McNair J, held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> However, the Bolam principle was rejected by the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_410;"><i>Foo Fio Na v. Dr Soo Fook Mun &amp; Anor</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 410</LINK>; [2007] 1 MLJ 593; [2007] 1 CLJ 229; [2002] 2 AMR 1524, in which the Federal Court instead adopted the Australian High Court decision in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> [1992] 109 ALR 625. Siti Norma Yaakob FCJ (as she then was), in delivering the unanimous decision of the Federal Court, held (at p 426):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>, it was held that the court had a duty to scrutinise the professional practice to ensure that it conforms with the standard set by law, and not leave that duty to be determined completely by the medical profession. In other words, whether the act complained of tantamounts to negligence or not is to be decided by the court, and not the medical profession. The High Court of Australia, headed by Mason CJ held (at p 631 of the judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Though we are well aware that in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>, the Federal Court confined the legal principle of <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> to a doctor's duty and standard of care in the field of providing advice to a patient on the inherent risks of a proposed treatment, nevertheless, we take the view that for all intent and purpose, the Federal Court would have extended the principle on the standard of care of a doctor in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> to the areas of diagnosis and treatment as well as advice. This is apparent from the fact that in arriving at its decision, the Federal Court referred to case laws from various jurisdictions dealing with the standard of care required of a medical professional in areas of treatment and diagnosis. As such, we are inclined to hold that the <i>Foo Fio Na's</i> decision ought to apply in the area of not just medical advice, but also to diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, we find that the test of the standard of care which is expected of a medical professional in the realm of diagnosis and treatment, should be a matter of judicial determination as opposed to medical judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Coming back to the present case, from the evidence adduced at trial, it is clear that the paralysis was caused by the implantation of the pedicle screws by the 1st defendant during the first surgery, which impinged on the plaintiff's spinal cord. This can be found in the report on the plaintiff prepared by the 1st defendant of the plaintiff (exh P15), which is reproduced in part below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The 1st defendant had also admitted that the pedicle screws were the cause of the plaintiff's inability to move her lower limbs, and this can be found in the cross-examination of the 1st defendant (at pp 81 and 84 of the Notes of Evidence):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The learned High Court Judge had posed further questions on the impingement of the plaintiff's spinal cord by the pedicle screws. The relevant part of the 1st defendant's testimony, when questioned by the learned High Court Judge is reproduced below (at pp 97-98 of the Notes of Evidence):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Thus, an inference could be made that the 1st defendant was negligent in carrying out the surgery. The issue that follows then is whether the 1st defendant has, by evidence, established that, notwithstanding having caused injury to the plaintiff's spinal cord, he was in no way liable in negligence towards the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> From the evidence of the 1st defendant, we note that nowhere in his evidence, did he explain that he had taken all precautions when inserting the pedicle screws into the plaintiff's vertebrae, to ensure that it would not injure the plaintiff's spinal cord. The 1st defendant merely gives a narration of the events that took place prior and post the surgery, and attributes the injury caused to the plaintiff's spinal cord as being caused by the impingement of the pedicle screws. The 1st defendant's evidence is reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> We note that the 1st defendant failed to explain the reason for the impingement of the plaintiff's spinal cord by the pedicle screws or the precautions which were taken to prevent or minimise such an injury on the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> As for the evidence of the defendant's expert witness, DW5, we also do not find his evidence helpful to the defendants' case, in discharging the evidential burden that the risk of injury to the plaintiff's spinal cord was inevitable, or that all precautions had been taken to avoid or minimise that risk of injury. Just like the 1st defendant, DW5's evidence in essence only touches on the medical procedure carried out by the 1st defendant, and DW5 attempts to justify that surgical procedure carried out by the 1st defendant on the plaintiff by saying that such procedure was in accordance with acceptable practice of the medical profession. Reference is made to the Medical Report of the plaintiff prepared by DW5 dated 7 February 2011, in which DW5 gives his medical opinion on the medical procedure of the plaintiff as below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> As we have said earlier in our judgment, whether the 1st defendant was in breach of the standard of care or not, is for the court to determine and not the medical profession. DW5's opinion on the 1st defendant's clinical judgment is a regress into <i>Bolam</i>'s principle, and which is no longer the test in determining the standard of care of the medical profession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> On the evidence, we find that the defendants failed to discharge the evidential burden imposed on them by law, by satisfying this court that the 1st defendant had taken all precautions during surgery to avoid injuring the plaintiff's spinal cord.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> On the contrary, what we have before us is the damaging evidence by the 1st defendant himself, which clearly shows that he failed to take all precautions to avoid injuring the plaintiff's spinal cord during surgery. This is in the form of his failure to utilise the SSEP monitoring machine during surgery. The 1st defendant testified in examination-in-chief that he proceeded with the surgery without the SSEP as the SSEP was not available on the day of surgery, and the plaintiff and her mother were insistent on proceeding with the surgery on that fateful day, regardless as to whether the SSEP was available or not. The 1st defendant's witness statement is reproduced here:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We are unable to accept the 1st defendant's explanation on his failure to use the SSEP during surgery. We find it unacceptable that the 1st defendant had allowed the plaintiff and her mother to cloud his clinical judgment to proceed with the surgery in the absence of the SSEP device. What is more glaring is that, prior to the surgery, the 1st defendant had decided on the SSEP, and had made a note for the availability of the SSEP, as is evident from the 1st defendant's clinical notes (exh D21). The clinical note is re-produced below and it reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In other words, the 1st defendant had decided that the SSEP would be required during the plaintiff's surgery but despite that, the 1st defendant did not use the SSEP and instead used the wake up test only because the SSEP was not available on the day of the surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We also note that DW5, in trying to justify the 1st defendant's decision not to use the SSEP, gave evidence to downplay the importance of the SSEP. DW5 testified that between the wake up test and the SSEP monitoring, the wake up test was more accurate and was considered as "gold standard". The SSEP monitoring, added DW5, was relatively new at that time and was not widely used. In other words, the 1st defendant had followed the accepted standard procedure at the material time by using the wake up test.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> However, that was not the reason forwarded by the 1st defendant to justify his decision to use the wake up test instead of the SSEP. As stated earlier, the 1st defendant did not use the SSEP because it was not available on the day and that the plaintiff and her mother were adamant that he proceeded with the surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Based on the evidence, we find that the 1st defendant had failed to adhere to the standard of care expected of a surgeon like him. The 1st defendant failed to explain that he did all that was within his capacity as a medical man to ensure that the plaintiff's spinal cord was not injured by the surgery. His decision not to use the SSEP, especially when he was well appraised with the plaintiff's condition, and knew that the plaintiff with her unique spinal deformity, had a higher risk of suffering complications during surgery, shows gross negligence on his part. We find that due to the plaintiff's medical condition, there was all the more reasons that the SSEP was necessary and should have been used by the 1st defendant during the plaintiff's surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> As such, we find that the evidence, when taken in totality, is adequate to hold the 1st defendant liable in negligence. In this regard, with due respect, we disagree with the learned trial judge that the plaintiff had failed to prove negligence against the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Second Issue: Whether The Plaintiff And Her Parents Were Informed Of The Risk Of Paralysis Prior To Consenting To Surgery?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> On the second issue, the plaintiff contends that the defendants ought to be held liable in negligence for failing to inform her and her parents of the inherent risk of paralysis before her parents executed the consent forms.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The law on the duty of a doctor to explain the inherent risks of a proposed surgery to his patient, has been well established and in Malaysia it can be found in the Federal Court case of <i>Foo Fio Na</i>. The Federal Court in <i>Foo Fio Na</i> was tasked with the duty of determining whether the <i>
Bolam</i>'s principle was still the standard of care to be applied in the realm of the duty of care expected of a doctor when informing his patient of the inherent risks of surgery. In answering the issue above in the negative, Siti Norma Yaakob FCJ (as she then was) held (at p 417 of the judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> That being the case, it is incumbent for us to examine the evidence closely to determine whether the risk of surgery, in this case paralysis, was informed by the defendants to the plaintiff's parents, to enable them to make an informed election on whether to proceed or otherwise with the surgery on the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In the present case, both the plaintiff (PW1), and her father, Mohammed Mustaffa Bin Nagoor Gany (PW2), testified that they were only informed that there was a 99% chance of success of the surgery and a 1% chance of mortality. It is the plaintiff's case that never at any time, was the risk of paralysis informed to her or her parents. The plaintiff's father testified that only DW6, Dr Chong Chee Seang, an Orthopedic and Spine Surgeon formerly attached with the 2nd defendant, informed him of the risk of the surgery, namely mortality. The plaintiff on the other hand testified that she was informed of the risk of mortality by the 1st defendant. Both the plaintiff and her father, were certain, that nothing was mentioned by the doctors to them of the risk of paralysis arising as a result of the surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The defendants deny that the risk of paralysis was never informed to the plaintiff or her parents. The defendants at all times maintain that the risk of paralysis was made known to the plaintiff and her parents, and that they were informed of the risk of paralysis before they consented to the surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> The 1st defendant testified that when he proposed a surgery to correct the plaintiff's spinal deformity on the second visit of the plaintiff, he explained the risks of surgery as well as the risk of paralysis to the plaintiff and her mother.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> One of the defendants' witnesses, one Dr Ravindran a/l Thuraisingam (DW2), a medical officer attached to the hospital at the material time, testified that he had explained all the risks of surgery to the plaintiff's mother, including the risks of spinal cord injury and infection, prior to obtaining the plaintiff mother's consent on the consent form (exh D23).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> DW2's evidence is supported by the testimony of Dr Jeyakanthan a/l Ratnasingham (DW3), who was a houseman attached to the hospital at the material time. DW3 testified that he had obtained the consent of the plaintiff's father (exh D25) on 30 August 2005 before the surgery was performed. DW3 further testified that since the plaintiff's surgery was an elective surgery, the risks of surgery would have been informed by the surgeon (that is, the 1st defendant) to the plaintiff and her parents. His duty, added DW3, was only to confirm that the plaintiff's father was informed of the risks by the surgeon and to ensure that the consent form was executed by the plaintiff's father.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> DW3 admitted in cross-examination that he did not explain the specific risks of the surgery to the plaintiff's father, as that had been done by the 1st defendant. DW3 further admitted that the risks of the surgery were not spelt out on the consent form, as it was a standard consent form and the consent form was only a procedure prior to surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> DW7, Dr Ng Swee Soon, a medical officer at the material time, had examined the plaintiff on three occasions, together with the 1st defendant. DW7 testified that he did not explain the risks of the surgery to the plaintiff as this was usually undertaken by the surgeon, the 1st defendant. When cross-examined, DW7 testified that he could not remember if the 1st defendant had informed the plaintiff or her parents of the risks of the surgery.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The learned High Court Judge made a finding that the risk of paralysis was informed to the plaintiff and her parents. The learned judge came to this finding based on the assumption, among others, that for such a major surgery as the one that was performed on the plaintiff, it was impossible and difficult to believe that the 1st defendant would not have explained the risk of paralysis to the plaintiff and her parents. The learned judge further held that if the risk of mortality, which is a mere 1%, was explained to the plaintiff, it cannot be possible that the risk of paralysis was not explained, what more in a surgery involving the spinal cord. The relevant part of the learned judge's Grounds of Judgment is reproduced below (at p 28):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> Further in the Grounds of Judgment, the learned judge held (at p 29):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> The learned judge also held that even though the consent forms (exhs D23 and D25) did not state specifically the risks which were informed to the plaintiff's parents, it did not mean that the risks, including paralysis were not verbally informed. In doing so, the learned judge relied on the High Court decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1996_2_349;"><i>Liew Sin Kiong v. Dr Sharon DM Paulraj</i> [1996] 2 MLRH 349</LINK>; [1996] 5 MLJ 193; [1996] 2 CLJ 995.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> With respect, we are unable to agree with the approach taken by the learned trial judge. Such an approach downplays the importance and purpose of the consent form, as well as the importance of the duty to warn patients of the inherent risks of the proposed treatment. Moreover, such a liberal approach by the court is open to abuse by medical practitioners.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> On the facts in the present case, we find that the plaintiff had successfully proven that the defendants had failed to inform her and her parents of the risk of paralysis. This is based on the fact that nowhere in either the consent forms (exhs D23 and D25), or the clinical notes of the plaintiff (exh D21) were the risks of paralysis, or for that matter, any risks mentioned at all. We do not accept the testimony of the defendants' witnesses, namely, DW5 and DW7 that, as the consent forms were standard forms, the risks are not mentioned specifically. On the contrary, we find that due to the plaintiff's history as an athlete, there was all the more reason that the risk of paralysis should have been mentioned clearly either in the consent forms or in the clinical notes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> We also find that the learned judge had erred when she made an assumption that just because the 1% risk of mortality had been informed to the plaintiff and her father, therefore the risk of paralysis, which was real and inherent in the surgery for scoliosis, must have been informed to the plaintiff and her parents. We feel that in the absence of any documentary evidence in support of the defendants' case that the risk of paralysis had been informed, the learned High Court Judge should not have made any assumptions and arrived at such a simplistic conclusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> For the above reasons, we hold that the 1st defendant was guilty of negligence in carrying out the surgery and was also negligent in failing to inform the plaintiff and her parents of the inherent risk of paralysis. Consequently, the 2nd defendant is found to be vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> We therefore allowed the appeal with costs of RM30,000 for here and below and set aside the decision of the High Court. We made an order for damages to be assessed by the Registrar of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <i>[Appeal allowed with costs of RM30,000.00, decision of the High Court set aside, damages to be assessed by the Registrar of the High Court]</i>
