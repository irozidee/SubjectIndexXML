    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was charged in the High Court with murder of the deceased under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The prosecution's case was <i>inter alia</i>, that the appellant had stabbed the deceased at the car-park of a hospital. The deceased had been stabbed several times and had suffered a fatal stab wound to the heart. At the close of the prosecution's case, the trial judge amended the charge to one under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK> and ordered the appellant to enter his defence. The appellant's defence was that he had merely grabbed a knife from the deceased in self-defence and had not stabbed the deceased. At the close of the defence case, the appellant was found guilty on the amended charge and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment from the date of arrest. The appellant appealed against conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was pursued on a number of grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was more than ample evidence that supported the findings of the trial judge. The trial judge had rightly concluded that the evidence of the defence witnesses merely confirmed the altercation that occurred at the car park and that a knife was used by the appellant and by the appellant's own admission he had thrown the knife which he had used against the deceased. There was nothing erroneous about the trial judge's finding that self-defence was not available to the appellant. The appellant's counsel was wrong to suggest that the trial judge had misdirected himself on the burden of proof on the defence. In assessing the defence at the conclusion of the case, the judge had deliberated on s 182 of the CPC and had considered the relevant authorities. (paras 11-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge had not said anything about the DNA evidence although much was said about the knife being used as the weapon of offence. Considering the totality of evidence, even without such evidence there was still ample evidence proving the use of the knife in the instant case. The failure of the trial judge to address his mind on the DNA evidence was of no consequence to the outcome of the case. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The discrepancies pointed out by counsel in the instant case were not material discrepancies. There were no good reasons for the Court of Appeal to interfere. (paras 25-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Although there was nothing in the grounds of judgment to indicate that the trial judge had "treated" SP4 and SP5 as interested witnesses, the trial judge had certainly acted and evaluated the evidential value of their evidence. Whilst the evidence of interested witnesses must be treated with caution, there is no rule of law requiring the trial judge to caution himself and make a specific ruling or finding on the credibility of such witnesses. In any event, the issue of SP4 and SP5 being interested witnesses could not change the fate of the appellant in the instant appeal. (paras 28, 30 &amp; 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The fact that there was a delay in obtaining the chemist report did not <i>ipso facto</i> create a break in the chain of evidence of the exhibits. Counsel was merely speculating in submitting that during the lapse of almost three years, there could have been others dealing with the exhibit and that no one had come forward to explain the actual movements and whereabouts of the exhibits during that period. (para 44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The trial judge had made a correct finding based on the evidence available before the court and had also rightly dealt with the law on culpable homicide. The trial judge had not committed any error in amending the charge to one under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>. The evidence proffered necessitated the amendment of the charge. (para 49)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> Although there was a lack of record to show that the appellant was allowed to recall or re-summon and examine witnesses who might have been examined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;162.;;">s 162 of the CPC</LINK>, the appellant here was represented by counsel and it was his choice to give evidence on oath and call six other witnesses in support of his defence. Until the very end, after the seventh defence witness was called, no indication and no request was made by the appellant either on his own or through his counsel to avail himself of his rights under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;162.;;">s 162 of the CPC</LINK>. Without asking, the appellant could not cry foul and later said that he had been denied of his right. If the appellant had managed to call six other witnesses, there was no foreseeable reason as to why he could not recall and re-summon any of the witnesses, had he asked for it. (para 57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> No prejudice has been caused to the appellant. It was his own failure and not of the trial judge. The phrase "shall be allowed to recall or re-summon and examine" must be taken to mean that an accused person could not be denied of that right if he chose to exercise that right and not otherwise. In any event, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> were there to redress the issue. (paras 59-60) </p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> while the written judgment prepared by the trial judge in the instant case might not be the best judgment, in its totality it met the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;308.;;">s 308 of the CPC</LINK>. The judgment had the basic elements and ingredients of a speaking judgment although it may not have been an ideal one. (paras 67-68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> There was no reason to disturb the sentence imposed on the appellant. The sentence imposed was neither wrong in law nor manifestly excessive or inadequate on the facts and in the circumstances of the case. (para 72)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged for the murder of one Karinathan a/l Ananthasegaran under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. At the end of the prosecution case, the learned trial judge amended the charge to one under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK> and ordered the appellant to enter his defence. At the close of the defence case, the appellant was found guilty under the amended charge and was sentenced to an imprisonment for a period of 20 years with effect from the date of his arrest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence, the appellant now appeals to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The brief facts of the case as unfolded in the prosecution case may be stated as follows. On 21 August 2010 at about 10.00pm SP4 the father of the deceased, was informed that his son, Thevandran, was involved in an accident and was brought to the Sultanah Aminah Hospital. Later at the hospital, together with his brother-in-law, Ramesh, SP4 went to the car park to smoke and saw the deceased talking to a group of Indian men. SP4 recognised that among these men, were SP5 and the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> SP4 saw there was pushing and shoving between the deceased and the appellant who was described as being long haired, shoulder length. SP4 went over to investigate and saw the appellant stabbing the deceased with a knife. SP4 took a rubbish bin to hit the appellant and was injured in the process. The injury to SP4's arm was caused by the appellant brandishing the knife against him. SP5 stated in a similar vein that he saw the appellant stabbing the deceased a few times using a knife.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The medical evidence tendered by the prosecution shows that the deceased suffered multiple stab wounds and the fatal injury was a stab wound to the heart. The deceased also suffered other stab wounds on his shoulder, left abdomen and left chest.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In advancing his appeal, the appellant had put forth a multitude of reasons attacking the decision of the learned trial judge. We append below the list of issues raised by the appellant's learned counsel in his written submissions. They are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We will deal with the issues raised, some of which may be dealt with collectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Burden Of Proof On The Defence And Beyond Reasonable Doubt</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On the first issue learned counsel submitted that the learned trial judge had failed to consider the evidence tendered by the defence witness that, the appellant did not stab the deceased but merely brandished the said knife. The appellant grabbed the knife from the deceased in self defence. He further submitted that the evidence of SD4 has been totally disregarded by the learned trial judge. The defence accordingly had raised a reasonable doubt and the appellant ought to have been acquitted and discharged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It ought to be said that the issue raised by the appellant touches on a finding of fact made by the learned trial judge. We will always be slow to interfere on the findings of facts made by a trial judge. We are satisfied that there is no merit at all in the submissions of learned counsel on the issue raised. We have perused the grounds of judgment as contained in Rekod Rayuan Tambahan 1 and we are satisfied that the learned trial judge had dealt with the issue of self-defence put forward by the appellant and had undertaken a detailed examination of learned counsel's submission on the issue of the knife exh P8A(1) as raised by the appellant (see pp 11-12 of Rekod Rayuan Tambahan 1).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> His Lordship had also rightly dealt with the law on self-defence and had quoted <i>Chanki Mathai v. State of Kerala</i> [1964] AIR Ker 222 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1980_1_12;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Ngoi Ming Sean</i> [1980] 1 MLRH 12</LINK>; [1982] 1 MLJ 24; [1981] CLJ 251 as reference on the appellants' right to self defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In our view, there is more than ample evidence that supports the findings of the learned trial judge. His Lordship had rightly concluded that the evidence of the defence witnesses merely confirmed the altercation that occurred at the car park and that a knife was used by the appellant and by the appellant's own admission he threw the knife which he had used against the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned trial judge had made a finding that self-defence was not available to the appellant. At p 16 of the Rekod Rayuan Tambahan 1, it was stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We do not find anything erroneous about the said finding and concur with the learned trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It was erroneous on the part of learned counsel to suggest that the learned trial judge had misdirected himself on the issue of burden of proof on the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We have perused the grounds of judgment and noted that the learned judge in assessing the defence at the conclusion of the case, had deliberated on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)</LINK> and considered the authorities of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_547;"><i>Balachandran v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 547</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 301; [2005] 1 CLJ 85; [2005] 1 AMR 321, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_91;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Saimin &amp; Ors</i> [1971] 1 MLRH 91</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 16 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1960_1_318;"><i>Liew Kaling &amp; Ors v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1960] 1 MLRA 318</LINK>; [1960] MLJ 306. In our view, that speaks volumes about burden of proof and beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Exhibit P8A(1) &amp; DNA Analysis</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Both SP4 and SP5 were unable to identify the knife (exh P8A) in court. Because of this, learned counsel submitted that there was a doubt as to who used the said knife and where it came from. Learned counsel also questioned how the DNA of the deceased was found on the said knife. Learned counsel went on to speculate that other individuals could have used the knife to stab the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We find this line of argument by learned counsel to be totally lacking in merit. Counsel should refrain from making submissions merely based on speculations and conjectures. It would have come about either because learned counsel had failed to go through the records of appeal and carefully read the notes of evidence, or simply was pursuing the case of his client without regard to the truth and the evidence before the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We are constrained to say that counsel appearing before the courts must render every assistance to judges in the business of dispensing justice. In this instance, we wish to remind counsel on the observation made by Lord Templeman in <i>Ashmore v. Corporation of Lloyds</i> [1992] 2 AER 486. This is what His Lordship had to say at p 493 on the issue we raised above:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We have considered the evidence of SP4 and SP5 relating to the knife. We have also considered the evidence of SP6, the police officer who recovered the knife near the scene of the crime. SP9 the chemist, who did tests on the same found traces of blood with the DNA of the deceased on it. We failed to understand what the issue really is with the knife. The appellant himself had admitted that a knife was used. We found learned counsel's submissions to be preposterous. We need not dwell any further on the issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On the DNA evidence given by the chemist (SP9), it was submitted that it has no evidential value because of the way SP9 gave her evidence. It was not explained how she was able to extract DNA sampling from the exhibit. <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_706;"><i>Hanafi Mat Hassan v. PP</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 706</LINK>; [2006] 4 MLJ 134; [2006] 3 CLJ 269; [2006] 4 AMR 281 was cited in support of this submission as to how an expert gives evidence on DNA in court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Having perused the grounds of judgment we do not seem to be able to find anything at all being said by the learned trial judge on this DNA evidence, although much was said about the knife being used as the weapon of offence. Be that as it may, considering the totality of the evidence, we are of the considered view that even without this piece of evidence, there were still ample evidence proving the use of the knife in the instant case. For that matter, even if the knife was not found or produced, does it mean that an offence such as this could not be established by the prosecution? The failure of the learned trial judge to address his mind on the DNA evidence in our view is of no consequence to the outcome of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Discrepancies In Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Speaking of discrepancies in the evidence of witnesses, the pertinent question that merits consideration is whether the discrepancies in the evidence are so material as to affect the prosecution's case. It was submitted that the evidence of SP4 and SP5 is contradictory to one another in describing the use of the knife by the appellant. According to learned counsel, this contradiction gives rise to two or more versions of the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It must always be borne in mind that not all discrepancies are material. Human faculties vary and the power of retention varies among individuals. Again, one's perception of a particular fact or event may also vary from others and more so over a period of time. No two witnesses can remember the same thing and give the same recollections accurately. In his submissions, learned counsel seems to have picked up every minor discrepancy in the evidence of the witnesses to bolster his argument. We find this to be undesirable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1983_2_403;"><i>Pie Bin Chin v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1983] 2 MLRH 403</LINK>; [1985] 1 MLJ 234, Wan Yahya J had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The learned trial judge had considered the evidence of these witnesses and had accepted their evidence. He was in the best position to assess and either to receive or reject their evidence. Although nothing was mentioned in his grounds of judgment about demeanour, we take it that His Lordship had accepted their evidence and had acted on that evidence. We shall not differ. We do not find the discrepancies referred to by learned counsel as material discrepancies. We only see one version of the prosecution's case, not two or more as submitted by learned counsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the same vein, we do not consider the discrepancies in the narration of the actual incident that took place on that fatal night to be of much consequence as to totally discredit the evidence of both SP4 and SP5. There is no rule of law which states that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. The matter is entirely in the hands of the learned trial judge and this court will always be slow and reluctant to interfere unless for a very good reason, which we find none in the instant case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Interested Witnesses</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant submitted on another aspect of the evidence which the learned trial judge had failed to consider. He contended that, both SP4 and SP5 are interested witnesses. SP4 was the father of the deceased, while SP5 was his friend. A number of authorities were referred to us supporting the proposition that evidence of interested witnesses should be treated with caution: (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_571;"><i>Rozmi Yusof v. PP</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 571</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 66; [2013] 4 CLJ 384, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_333;"><i>Magendran Mohan v. PP</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 333</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 1; [2011] 1 CLJ 805; [2011] 2 AMR 680, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1967_1_597;"><i>Lim Boon San v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1967] 1 MLRH 597</LINK>; [1968] 2 MLJ 457). It was further contended that the learned trial judge had also failed to make a finding as to the credibility of the two said witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> While we may agree with learned counsel that there is nothing in the grounds of judgment to indicate that the learned trial judge had "treated" SP4 and SP5 as interested witness, the fact remains that, His Lordship had certainly acted and evaluated the evidential value of their evidence. This, we say so because, the learned trial judge had in amending the charge to one under s 304 of the Penal Code found some discrepancies and inconsistencies in their evidence. His Lordship had found there was a lot of confusion during the commotion. At least they were 6-7 people from the deceased's group as stated by SP13, the Investigating Officer, while SP4 at one stage during cross examination stated during the altercation there were about 15-20 people.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> To say that the learned trial judge had not realised or was unaware of the relationship between the deceased with SP4 and SP5 is merely to deny the obvious.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We have considered the list of authorities on this issue and we conclude that while the evidence of interested witnesses must be treated with caution, there is no rule of law requiring the trial judge to caution himself and make a specific ruling or finding on the credibility of such witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1967_1_597;"><i>Lim Boon San v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1967] 1 MLRH 597</LINK>; [1968] 2 MLJ 45 referred to by learned counsel merits our comments. Raja Azlan Shah J (as His Highness then was) had made the following remarks:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The head note to the said case states as follows: Held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It was submitted in that case, the witness PW3 was an accomplice but the court found that at the very highest, he was a witness having a purpose to serve and therefore the warning against uncorroborated evidence should be given.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In our view the said case is clearly distinguishable from the case before us. Both SP4 and SP5 are nowhere near as an accomplice and they can never be equated with the witness PW3 in <i>Lim Boon San</i> who had a purpose of his own to testify in the way he did. Furthermore we are not satisfied that there was a miscarriage of justice in the instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Call it whatever, (learned counsel had submitted the judgment to be a non-speaking judgment) we found the learned trial judge had in his grounds of judgment scrutinised both the evidence of SP4 and SP5 quite extensively in finding that a <i>prima facie</i> case of culpable homicide under s 304 of the Penal Code was made out. In our view, it is a reflection of the learned trial judge's evaluation and assessment of the evidence not only that of SP4 and SP5 but also the totality of the evidence led by the prosecution. Lest we forget, altogether thirteen witnesses were called by the prosecution to prove its case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In the upshot, we do not consider the issue of SP4 and SP5 being interested witnesses can change the fate of the appellant in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Incomplete Investigation And Chain Of Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Grounds number 12 and 14 in the appellant's petition of appeal read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> These two grounds were taken up together with grounds number 8 and 17 which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The failure of the police to carry out proper investigation has deprived not only the prosecution but also the defence of the best and most important evidence to resolve the case. Learned counsel further submitted the failure to do so means, there was withholding or suppression of evidence favourable to the defence and thus the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK> presumption ought to be invoked. We were also reminded of the passage from the judgment of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_608;"><i>Pang Chee Meng v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 608</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 137; [1992] 1 CLJ 265 which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We note that there are three investigating officers involved in this case and it has been explained that it happened because the actual investigating officer (SP13) on duty that day was away in Kuala Lumpur doing his further studies during the weekends. SP11 did the initial investigation with SP12 as the Senior Investigating Officer in charge. Be that as it may, we fail to see how the failure to obtain finger prints from the knife and whether the knife had a handle (hulu) or otherwise is so material to the prosecution's case. We have dealt with the issue on the knife in the earlier part of this judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In <i>Srichand v. State of Maharashtra</i> [1967] AIR SC 451 at pg 453 the Indian Supreme Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Another aspect of the investigation which came under heavy criticism by the appellant was the delay in sending the exhibits to the Jabatan Kimia, a delay of almost three years after the date of the incident. It was submitted that there has been a break in the chain of evidence in respect of the exhibits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We do not find any basis for this submission. At p 167 of the Rekod Rayuan, the Investigating Officer, SP13 had given the following explanation upon being examined by the DPP and the court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We found the explanation to be plausible and the fact that there was a delay in obtaining the chemist report does not <i>ipso facto</i> create a break in the chain of evidence of the exhibits. Learned counsel was merely speculating in submitting that during the lapse of almost three years there could have been others dealing with the exhibit and that no one has come forward to explain the actual movements and whereabouts of the exhibits during that period.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Amendment Of Charge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> It was contended by the appellant that the learned trial judge had erred in finding that "there was a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We do not agree with counsel's submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> At pp 9 and 10 of the Rekod Rayuan Tambahan 1, in amending the charge to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>, the learned trial judge had made the following findings"</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> And going further, His Lordship concluded:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> We are of the considered view that the learned trial judge had made a correct finding based on the evidence available before the court and had also rightly dealt with the law on culpable homicide. We found the learned trial judge had not committed any error in amending the charge to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal Code</LINK>. The evidence proffered necessitate the amendment of the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In the same vein, we are also satisfied that it is implicit in His Lordship's judgment that the procedure under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180 of the CPC</LINK> had been complied with in finding that a <i>prima facie</i> case under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(a) of the Penal code</LINK> had been made out against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Failure To Comply With <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;162.;;">Section 162 CPC</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;162.;;">Section 162 of the CPC</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that this provision had not been complied with and this is yet another error committed by the learned trial judge. We were urged to set aside the conviction on the amended charge. In support, learned counsel relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_221;"><i>Ng Terk Chai v. PP &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 221</LINK>; [2013] 2 MLJ 375; [2013] 4 CLJ 342, a decision of this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> At this juncture it would be relevant to refer to the notes of proceedings as to ascertain what actually transpired when the learned trial judge made the decision to amend the charge. We append below the notes of proceedings on 5 September 2012 which is at p 182 of the Rekod Rayuan:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Having perused the said notes, we are satisfied that an amended charge was framed, read and explained to the appellant. Further at pp 10-11 of the Rekod Rayuan Tambahan I the learned trial judge had also penned the following in the grounds of judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Coming back to the case of <i>Ng Terk Chai v. PP &amp; Other Appeals (supra)</i> what had happened in that case is a totally different scenario altogether. The appeal records in that case do not show that the learned High Court Judge had amended the charge to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;392.;;">s 392 of the Penal Code</LINK> to be read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;397.;;">s 397</LINK> of the same. There was also nothing on record to show that the amended charge was read and explained to all the three accused and their pleas taken and they be given the option of recalling witnesses. Questions were also posed by the court to parties as to whether the defects are curable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK>. To this, the learned deputy had conceded that the defects are not curable. Hence, the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge on the three accused persons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> A very clear distinction may be made between this appeal and <i>Ng Terk Chai</i>. If at all there is an irregularity in the instant appeal, it is in respect of the lack of record to demonstrate that the appellant was allowed to recall or re summon and examine any witness who may have been examined and the opportunity to call any further evidence which may be material.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We have considered the fact that the appellant was represented by a counsel and it was the appellant's choice to give evidence on oath and called six other witnesses in support of the defence. Until the very end, after the seventh defence witness was called, no indication and no request was made by the appellant either on his own or through his counsel to avail himself of his rights under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;162.;;">s 162 of the CPC</LINK>. Without asking, the appellant cannot cry foul and now say that he has been denied of his right. If the appellant had managed to call six other witnesses, we could see no foreseeable reason as to why he could not recall and re summon any of the witnesses, had he asked for it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> We further observed and took note that the appellant did make his intention clear to the court to call at least three witnesses from among the list of witnesses offered to the defence at the close of the prosecution's case. (See pp 180-181 Rekod Rayuan)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In any event, we are of the view that no prejudice has been caused to the appellant. It was his own failure and not of the learned trial judge. The phrase "shall be allowed to recall or re-summon and examine" must be taken to mean that an accused person cannot be denied of that right if he chooses to exercise that right and not otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Be that as it may, again we find that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> are there to redress the issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Non Speaking Judgment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant had labelled the judgment of the learned trial judge as a non-speaking and not a reasoned judgment. He submitted the said judgment is found to be lacking in the following issues:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Upon a closer look at the reasons stated by learned counsel as listed above, we can only say that these reasons are nothing more than a mere regurgitation of the issues in the grounds of appeal. It basically boils down to the issue on the evidence of SP4 and SP5 and incomplete investigation. We have already dealt with these issues in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment and we need say no more.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Judgment writing is a matter of individual style and the need for a speaking judgment needs no emphasis. It is an elementary principle of fairness that parties must not only be given a fair opportunity of being heard, but also appraised of how and why a judge has reached his decision. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;308.;;">Section 308 of the CPC</LINK> speaks of "Grounds of Decision" which means a reasoned judgment on the facts and the law and not merely the conclusion arrived at. What amounts to a speaking judgment varies from case to case. Mere regurgitation or narration of the facts and a statement of the law does not amount to a speaking judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Shaikh Daud JCA sitting in the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_292;"><i>Ganapathy Rengasamy v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 292</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 577; [1998] 2 CLJ 1; [1999] 1 AMR 1 at p 293 found the Grounds of Judgment of the learned judge far from satisfactory in that they do not convey a 'speaking' judgment. The judgment consists substantially of reproduction of the prosecution's witnesses' testimonies in the form of questions and answers. The learned judge failed to analyse or assess these testimonies. He merely set them out and presumably accepted them without question. He has not set out the defence of the appellant with a view to assessing it, nor has he tested the defence by comparing it with the evidence adduced by the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> We may agree with learned counsel that the judgment written by the learned trial judge would be 'complete' had the learned trial judge dedicated his attention and make further comments on the nature of the evidence of both SP4 and SP5 instead of just merely glancing through their evidence very generally and in passing. A judgment need not necessarily be lengthy, however as in the instant case, where the evidence of both SP4 and SP5 stood in prominence, it is only reasonable to expect that further deliberations be made and the conclusions drawn by the trial judge be made apparent in the judgment. The absence of such deliberation and reasoning will certainly open the judgment being criticised as non-speaking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1974_1_147;"><i>Tan Kim Leng &amp; Anor v. Chong Boon Eng &amp; Anor</i> [1974] 1 MLRA 147</LINK>; [1974] 2 MLJ 151, HRH Raja Azlan Shah FJ laid down:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> While we say that the written judgment prepared by the learned trial judge in this case may not be the best judgment, but in its totality we are satisfied that it meets the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;308.;;">s 308 of the CPC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> We did a very close scrutiny of the judgment and we are of the view that the said judgment has the basic elements and ingredients of a speaking judgment although it may not be an ideal one, so to say. By way of comparison the said judgment 'speaks' far much more than the one referred to in <i>Ganapathy Rengasamy (supra)</i> and the eight lines judgment written by the judge in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1940_1_535;"><i>Rex v. Low Toh Cheng</i> [1940] 1 MLRA 535</LINK>; [1941] 1 MLJ 1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Sentence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> On sentence, the petition of appeal categorically states that the learned trial judge had erred in imposing the sentence when His Lordship had taken into account irrelevant facts, being speculative and making inferences. Paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Petition of Appeal reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The appellant however was remorseful enough and begging for leniency when he pleaded in para 24 of the Petition of Appeal as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> We must caution counsel to act responsibly when filing petitions of appeal on behalf of their clients. Making unwarranted and unsubstantiated statements such as what had been stated in paras 21 and 22 of the Petition of Appeal does not augur well for members of this honourable profession. In the course of his submission we did not even hear a word from counsel about the complaint in grounds number 21 and 22 of the Petition of Appeal and so too, his written submissions. And neither do we find anything in the notes of evidence or the grounds of judgment to suggest that the learned trial judge had committed the matters complained of. Grounds number 21 and 22 of the Petition of Appeal are totally baseless.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> We have considered the sentence imposed on the appellant by the learned trial judge and having ourselves considered the plea in mitigation as it appeared in the Rekod Rayuan, we found no reason to disturb the sentence imposed on him. We are not satisfied that the sentence imposed was either wrong in law or that it was manifestly excessive or inadequate on the facts and in the circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> We unanimously dismiss the appeal and the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned trial judge is affirmed.</p>
