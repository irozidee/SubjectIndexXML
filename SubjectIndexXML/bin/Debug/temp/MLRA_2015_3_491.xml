    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The Selangor State Government had alienated a piece of land ("the land") to Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor ("PKNS"). Pending the issuance of the title to the land, PKNS entered into an agreement dated 28 November 1988 ("the principal agreement") to lease the land to the appellant for 30 years, commencing on 28 December 1988 and expiring on 28 December 2018. In 1990, the appellant obtained loans from Bank Buruh (Malaysia) Berhad ("BBMB"). As security the appellant executed a Loan Agreement Cum Assignment dated 16 April 1990 ("LACA"), assigning all rights, title and interest under the principal agreement to BBMB. Subsequently, BBMB's business and assets were transferred to and rested into the respondent bank. In 2003, unknown to the respondent, title to the land was issued and registered in the name of PKNS. The appellant also defaulted in its payments under the loans to the respondent, resulting in a civil action and subsequent judgment entered against the appellant. Thereafter, the respondent in the exercise of its rights under the LACA conducted a public auction on 28 December 2005 and sold its rights, title and interest under the principal agreement to the purchaser. By letter dated 19 April 2006, PKNS gave its approval to the respondent's sale and was prepared to sign its consent to the purchaser, provided that the deed of assignment by way of transfer was forwarded to PKNS. However, on the same day, <i>viz</i> 19 April 2006, the appellant filed an originating summons in the High Court seeking <i>inter alia</i>, (i) a declaration that the respondent had no right to enforce the Loan Agreements, the LACA and the Power of Attorney concerned; (ii) an order and declaration that the sale by the respondent was <i>ultra vires</i> the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK>, and (iii) an order that the auction sale on 28 December 2005 be set aside. It was the appellant's case that once the individual title was issued, the respondent could not sell its rights to the land under the principal agreement and the LACA, but had to first execute a legal charge over the title and effect a sale pursuant to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>. The appellant's application was allowed by the High Court on 27 September 2010, but on 8 February 2012, the Court of Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal and set aside the High Court's order of 27 September 2010. The appellant obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court for determination of the following issue: "Whether a lender having an absolute assignment of rights to land may realise his security under the terms of the assignment, where document of title to the land was issued subsequently, without the need to resort to the remedies provided under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>".</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> answering the question in the affirmative and dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Whether or not an assignment is an absolute one not purporting to be by way of charge or security only is to be gathered from the four corners of the instrument itself and all the terms of the instrument must be considered. <i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd (refd)</i>. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the assignment document was the LACA. The use of the words "absolutely assigns" in the LACA clearly demonstrated that the instrument was intended by the parties to be an absolute assignment and not one by way of charge only. An absolute assignment is an equitable mortgage and the essence of a mortgage is that there is a transfer of the ownership of a chose in action, not the land, to the mortgagee. The individual title of the land was still registered in the name of PKNS as its registered proprietor. (paras 25 &amp; 45(i))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the absolute assignment was in relation to a transfer of the legal right of the chose in action from the appellant to the respondent as assigned therein within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>. Thus, when the respondent exercised its power of sale under the LACA to dispose of its rights by way of a further assignment, it only involved a transfer of a legal right to the chose in action to the purchaser. In the absence of any statutes or express provisions in the assignment restricting the disposal of such rights, the respondent was entitled to exercise its powers of sale and to have its rights to the chose in action transferred. Such powers and rights were not extinguished by reason of the issuance of the issue document of title to the land. (paras 26 &amp; 45(ii), (iii), (iv) &amp; (vi)]</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The case of <i>Phileoallied Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v. Bupinder Singh Avatar Singh &amp; Anor</i> was not an authority for the proposition that an assignee loses the power of sale that he has once the issue document of title to the land has been issued. <i>Bupinder Singh</i> was not applicable in the instant case which sought to determine whether the respondent as an absolute assignee had lost its power of sale under the LACA in a situation where title over the secured land had been issued. <i>Phileoallied Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v. Bupinder Singh Avatar Singh &amp; Anor (distd)</i>. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Clauses 25(1) and (2) of the LACA only conferred contractual rights or privileges to the respondent in terms of the execution of a charge upon the issuance of the separate document of individual title in respect of the land. The respondent was not, however, obliged to ensure the execution of the charge and thereafter to obtain an order for judicial sale before it could proceed to exercise its rights under the LACA upon the appellant's default under the loan. (paras 30 &amp; 45(v), (vi)]</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The creation of a charge was not a prerequisite for the respondent before it could proceed with the recovery action against the appellant under the LACA despite the issuance of the issue document of title. Similarly, there was also no requirement under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> for the title to vest in the appellant and then for a charge to be executed before the security created in relation to the land could be realised by the respondent. The respondent did not lose its power of sale over its rights to the land merely by reason that the issue document of title to the land had been issued. (paras 31 &amp; 45(v))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> It was untenable to deprive the respondent from enforcing its rights and powers as provided to it under cls 9 and 11 of the LACA merely by reason of the issue of the document of title to the land. In the absence of any statutory provision or any express bar in the assignment to that effect, the respondent was entitled to and could not be prohibited from exercising its power and rights as stipulated under cls 9 and 11 of the LACA. The fact that there was no charge created upon the issuance of the issue document of title to the land and no order for a judicial sale had been obtained by the respondent did not prevent the respondent from enforcing its rights under the LACA to proceed with the recovery action upon the default by the appellant. (paras 32 &amp; 41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> This court was unable to agree with the view of the appellant that since the document of title to the land had been issued, the respondent had to create the proposed charge first before it could proceed with the foreclosure proceedings. This suggested that where the issue document of title to land had been issued, an absolute assignment must first be extinguished before the assignee could foreclose the land. This was not the correct proposition of the law. There is nothing in law which says that once a document of title is issued, an absolute assignment must be extinguished. <i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Goh Sin Khai (folld)</i>. (paras 33 &amp; 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> This court would agree with the point submitted by the respondent's counsel that if, as the appellant contended, the respondent could not effect an assignment sale but had to create a charge over the title first and then apply for an order for sale under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>, the time and costs would be detrimental to both the respondent and the appellant.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdull Hamid Embong FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The subject matter of the present appeal concerns a piece of land known as Lot No 2, Jalan Lingkaran 1, Fasa 11A, Bhg 2, Peringkat 1, Kawasan Perusahaan Selat Kelang, Pelabuhan Kelang, Selangor ("the land") which was to be alienated by the State Government of Selangor to Perbandaran Kemajuan Negeri Selangor ("PKNS").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Pending the issue of a document of title to the land, PKNS entered into an agreement to lease dated 28 November 1988 ("the principal agreement") with the appellant thereby granting a lease over the land to the appellant for a period of thirty years commencing from 28 December 1988 and expiring on 28 December 2018 ("the lease").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In 1990, the appellant obtained loans of RM1.2 million and RM750,000.00 from Bank Buruh (Malaysia) Berhad ("BBMB").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As security for the repayment of the loans, a Loan Agreement Cum Assignment dated 16 April 1990 ("LACA") was executed by the appellant thereby assigning absolutely all its rights, title and interest under the principal agreement in favour of BBMB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 11 March 1995, BBMB changed its name to BSN Commercial Bank (Malaysia) Berhad and its business and assets were subsequently transferred to and vested into the respondent ("the bank") pursuant to a Vesting Order dated 18 December 2000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In 2003, unknown to the bank, title to the land was issued and registered in the name of PKNS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> At about the same time, the appellant defaulted in its payment obligations under the said loans and became indebted to the bank in the total sum of RM1,311,631.48 as at 30 September 2003 with interest thereon from 1 October 2003 to date of full settlement. A judgment on that debt was obtained against the appellant on 26 February 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In the circumstances, the bank in exercise of its rights under the LACA conducted a public auction on 28 December 2005 and sold its rights, title and interest under the Principal Agreement to one Asia Route (M) Sdn Bhd ("the purchaser"), who was the only bidder, at the reserved price of RM1.8 million.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Since, by then, the land had been already registered in the name of PKNS, the bank informed PKNS of the same. By letter dated 19 April 2006, PKNS gave its approval to the bank's aforesaid sale and was prepared to sign its consent to the purchaser, provided that the deed of assignment by way of transfer was forwarded to PKNS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On the same day, ie on 19 April 2006, the appellant filed the originating summons in the High Court seeking <i>inter alia</i> the following reliefs against the bank:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was the appellant's case that once the individual title was issued, the bank could not sell its rights to the land under the principal agreement and the LACA, but must first execute a legal charge over the title and effect a sale pursuant to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The bank, however, took the position that it was fully entitled to exercise its powers under the LACA and sell its rights under the principal agreement and to the land by way of a further assignment, without resorting to the statutory remedy route, ie having to create a charge and subsequent to that, to file a foreclosure action, as provided under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 27 September 2010, the appellant's application was allowed by the High Court. The High Court relied primarily on previous High Courts' decisions of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2003_1_16;"><i>Ooi Chin Nee v. Citibank Bhd</i> [2003] 1 MLRH 16</LINK>; [2003] 1 CLJ 548 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_1_817;"><i>Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd v. Chew Ai Eng Sdn Bhd; OCBC Bank (Malaysia) Bhd (Applicant)</i> [2004] 1 MLRH 817</LINK>; [2004] 6 CLJ 497.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 8 February 2012, the Court of Appeal allowed the bank's appeal and set aside the High Court's order of 27 September 2010.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Question</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The appellant applied to this court for leave to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal, which was granted on 8 January 2013 on the following sole question of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was argued for the appellant that the principles set out in the cases of <i>Ooi Chin Nee (supra)</i> and <i>Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> which were relied upon by the High Court in allowing the appellant's application, remain good law. It was argued that the two cases above supported the appellant's contention that where the issue document of title to the land had been issued, the bank has to create the proposed charge first before foreclosure proceedings could be filed. It follows that an order for sale must be obtained pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;31.;;">O 31</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;83.;;">O 83 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the NLC</LINK> before the land could be auctioned. Thus, the bank cannot unilaterally seek a sale by itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant further contended that the Court of Appeal, in rejecting the principles propounded in <i>Ooi Chin Nee</i> and <i>Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd</i>, had in effect extended the principle enunciated by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_128;"><i>Phileoallied Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v. Bupinder Singh Avatar Singh &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 128</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 513; [2002] 2 CLJ 621; [1999] 3 AMR 3086 which recognised the power of the bank to auction off property in a situation where no title had been issued, to one where title has been issued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant also urged the court to look into public policy considerations that if there is a power to sell privately any property with title, without the order of the court, then the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">ss 256</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;257.;;">257 of the NLC</LINK> and the Rules of Court would be rendered redundant at the option of financial institutions. The protection of the court envisaged under a judicial sale would then be rendered nugatory.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Learned counsel for the bank submitted that in the present case, it cannot be disputed that the assignment granted by the appellant in favour of the bank under the LACA was an absolute one (not purporting to be by way of charge only) within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>. In this regard, she referred to cl 7(1) of the LACA which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It was also submitted that it is settled law that an absolute assignment creates an equitable mortgage. In support of that proposition, he cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_420;"><i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 420</LINK>; [1998] 3 MLJ 97; [1999] 2 CLJ 917; [1995] 3 AMR 2331. <i>Bupinder Singh (supra)</i> was cited in support of his contention that in the absence of any statutory provisions or common law requiring the equitable mortgagee to obtain a court order to realise its security under an absolute assignment of rights to land, the court should give effect to and recognise the contractual rights as determined between the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Learned counsel for the bank also argued that in enforcing its rights for recovery against the appellant, the bank did not sell the land per se. What the bank sold was its rights and title under the LACA and the principal agreement, namely its rights to a lease to the land. In other words, the bank sold its "chose in action" that has been transferred from the appellant through an absolute assignment under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It was further submitted that as an equitable mortgagee, the power of the bank to exercise its rights to sell the land was not affected by the fact that the title to the land has been issued. In this respect, she relied on the terms of the LACA, particularly cls 9, 11, 25(1) and 25(2) and argued that these clauses merely confer contractual rights or privileges to the bank over the land. She further contended that it is not obligatory or mandatory for the bank, pursuant to these clauses, to create a charge on the land before commencing its recovery action.</p>

      <b>The Absolute Assignment: Its Legal Effect</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The law on assignment is governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A "chose in action" is legally defined as "a thing of which a person has not the present enjoyment, but merely a right to recover it (if withheld) by action" (see <i>Mozley &amp; Whiteley's Law Dictionary</i> (10<sup>th</sup> edn). Essentially, it is a personal right to sue, ie a right to enforce payment of a debt by legal proceedings or to sue for damages for contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Whether or not an assignment is an absolute one not purporting to be by way of charge or security only is to be gathered only from the four corners of the instrument itself and all the terms of the instrument must be considered (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_477;"><i>Nouvau Mont Dor (M) Sdn Bhd v. Faber Development Sdn Bhd</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 477</LINK>; [1984] 2 MLJ 268; [1985] CLJ (Rep) 231).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the present case, the assignment document is the LACA, in which cl 7(1) therein states that the appellant, as the borrower, "absolutely assigns to the bank the lease of the said land and the full and entire benefit of the principal agreement together with the rights, title and interest of the borrower therein". In this regard, the use of the words "absolutely assigns" in the provision of the LACA clearly demonstrates that the instrument was intended by the parties to be an absolute assignment and not one by way of charge only (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1989_1_141;"><i>Hipparion (M) Sdn Bhd v. Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd</i> [1989] 1 MLRA 141</LINK>; [1989] 2 MLJ 149; [1989] 1 CLJ 41). The law in relation to absolute assignment is clear. An absolute assignment is an equitable mortgage and the essence of a mortgage is that there is a transfer of the ownership of a chose in action, not the land, to the mortgagee (see <i>Bupinder Singh and Chuah Eng Khong (supra)</i>). It must be remembered that the individual title of the land is registered in the name of PKNS as its registered proprietor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Now, the principal agreement mentioned in the assignment is the agreement between PKNS and the appellant for a lease over the land for a period of thirty years. In this regard, the appellant has only a right <i>in personam</i>, that is the contractual right or benefit accruing to it under the said principal agreement. That right is a chose in action which is enforceable by action if it is unlawfully withheld by PKNS. It is this right to a lease to the land that becomes the subject matter of the absolute assignment between the appellant and the bank under the LACA. The absolute assignment, therefore, is in relation to a transfer of the legal right of the chose in action from the appellant to the bank as assigned therein within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>. It follows that when the bank exercised its power of sale under the LACA to dispose of its rights by way of a further assignment, it only involves a transfer of a legal right to the chose in action to the purchaser. In the absence of any statutes or express provisions in the assignment restricting the disposal of such rights, the bank is entitled to exercise its powers of sale and to have its rights to the chose in action transferred. Such powers and rights, in our view, are not extinguished by reason of the issuance of the issue document of title to the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The appellant contended that the ratio in <i>Bupinder Singh</i>'s case on the enforcement of the sale rights has been restricted to situations where no title has been issued. It was argued that since in this case, the document of title to the land had been issued, the proper and correct procedure is therefore to execute a charge and to obtain the order of the court for the sale of the land pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;83.;;">O 83 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The case of <i>Bupinder Singh</i> involves a situation where there is no issue document of title and as such it is not an authority for the proposition that an assignee loses the power of sale that he has, once the issue document of title to a land has been issued. On the facts, we say that <i>Bupinder Singh</i> is not applicable in the present case which is to determine whether the bank as an absolute assignee has lost its power of sale under the LACA in a situation where title over the secured land has been issued. In any event, this court in <i>Bupinder Singh</i> decided that "in the absence of any statutory provisions or common law requiring the equitable mortgagee to obtain a court order to realise its security under an absolute assignment of rights to land, the court should give effect to and recognise the contractual rights as determined between the vendor and the purchaser."</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Contractual Obligations Under The LACA</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In view of the fact that the document of title has been issued in this case, it is pertinent therefore to examine the provisions governing the contractual obligations of the parties in respect of the creation of a charge under the LACA. Clauses 25(1) and (2) of the LACA read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> On the plain reading of these two clauses, we agree with the submission of learned counsel for the bank that these clauses only confer contractual rights or privileges to the bank in terms of the execution of a charge upon the issuance of the separate document of individual title in respect of the land. In our considered view, the bank is not, however, obliged to ensure the execution of the charge and thereafter to obtain an order for judicial sale before it could proceed to exercise its rights under the LACA upon the appellant's default under the loan. The underlined phrases in both subclauses above are manifestations of these rights of the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The creation of a charge is not however a prerequisite for the bank before it could proceed with the recovery action against the appellant under the LACA despite the issuance of the issue document of title. Similarly, there is also no requirement under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> for the title to vest in the appellant and then for a charge to be executed before the security created in relation to the land can be realised by the bank. In other words, the bank does not lose its power of sale over its rights to the land merely by reason that the issue document of title to the land has been issued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It should be noted that the entitlement and power of the bank to exercise its rights to sell the lease over the land in the event of the appellant's default are clearly provided for under cls 9 and 11 of the LACA. Clause 9 sets out the events of default upon which the bank is entitled to recover the sums of money owed under the LACA and to exercise the rights and powers provided thereunder by law without any previous notice to or concurrence on the part of the appellant. Meanwhile, cl 11 provides for the power of the bank, upon the events of default referred to under cl 9, which includes the right and power to sell and assign the lease of the said land as the absolute unencumbered owner thereof at such price and in such manner as the bank shall in its absolute discretion think fit. In our view, it is therefore untenable to deprive the bank from enforcing its rights and powers as provided to it under cls 9 and 11 of the LACA merely by reason of the issue of the document of title to the land. In the absence of any statutory provision or any express bar in the assignment to that effect, the bank is entitled to and cannot be prohibited from exercising its power and rights as stipulated under cls 9 and 11 of the LACA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In addition, we are unable to agree with the view of the appellant that since the document of title to the land has been issued, the bank has to create the proposed charge first before it could proceed with the foreclosure proceedings. This seems to suggest that in a situation where the issue document of title to a land has been issued, an absolute assignment must first be extinguished before the assignee could foreclose the land. We do not think this is the correct proposition of the law. There is nothing in law which says that once document of title is issued, the absolute assignment is extinguished. On this point, we agree and cite with approval these passages from the judgment of the High Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2005_1_422;"><i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Goh Sin Khai</i> [2005] 1 MLRH 422</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 154; [2005] 3 CLJ 24; [2005] 3 AMR 469 which held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It is to be noted that in <i>Goh Sin Khai</i>, the High Court was asked to determine on a similar issue as to whether a lender having an assignment, may realise his security when there is an issue document of title to the property, without creating a charge and obtaining an order of sale from the court. The High Court answered the question in the affirmative and disagreed with the reasoning and observations made in <i>Ooi Chin Nee</i> and <i>Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd</i> which held the opposite view.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In <i>Goh Sin Khai</i>, the learned High Court Judge had critically examined the reasoning made by the learned judges of the High Court in <i>Ooi Chin Nee</i> and <i>Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd</i> in arriving at their decisions on the issue. His Lordship had discussed in great length as to why, in his view, the decisions of the High Court in those two cases were wrong. The learned judge's correct observations can be gleaned from the following passages of his judgment which says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The case of <i>Ooi Chin Nee</i> was referred and followed by <i>Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd</i> but on a different ground. In respect of <i>Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd</i>, the learned judge in <i>Goh Sin Khai</i> made the following observations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The learned judge's observations on the reasoning made in the above two cases and his explanations that followed were very extensive to which, we feel, need no further elaboration here. Suffice to say that on the perusal of the judgment in <i>Goh Sin Khai</i>, we fully agree with the reasons given by the learned judge in that case and in disagreeing with the reasoning in <i>Ooi Chin Nee and Jashin Scaffolding (M) Sdn Bhd</i>. We also do not see any necessity for us to add, minus or expand on the reasons given by the said learned judge in that respect, save to say that they are the correct exposition of the law in respect of an absolute assignment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In the course of the submission, learned counsel for the bank also urged the court to look into the historical development of our land laws to which, she argued, is consistent with the practice of transferring interests in land by way of assignments. In this regard, referrals were made to some of the earlier legislations relating to land laws in our country, first, by giving an example of the Selangor Registration of Titles Regulations 1891 which contained therein the provisions specifically prohibiting the dealing, transfer, mortgage and charge of land except in accordance with the relevant provisions made under the Regulations (which among others required the execution of a charge in the prescribed form and to be duly registered) (See ss 4 and 41 of the Regulations). It was further argued that the Federated Malay States Registration of Titles Enactment of 1911 and Land Code of 1926 which were enacted and came into force later also adopted and contained similar provisions to that effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Learned counsel for the bank submitted that our present <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> which was enacted in 1965 for the first time as a uniform code of land law for the states in Peninsular Malaya however does not adopt all the provisions similar to those contained in the earlier legislations which prohibited the contractual operation involving rights relating to land or any interests therein save in accordance to the provisions made thereunder. In contrast, our present <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> recognises the contractual operation relating to land as envisaged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;206.;;">s 206(3) of the NLC</LINK>, apart from the other dealings mentioned under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;206.;;">ss 206(1)</LINK> which requires the compliance of instrument in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;207.;;">ss 207</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;212.;;">212</LINK> and registration under Part Eighteen of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;206.;;">Section 206 of the NLC</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In light of the above, learned counsel for the bank submitted that the LACA or assignment sale by the bank in this case is thus a contractual operation which is recognised by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>. Further, it was argued that there is nothing under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> or any law which prohibits the contractual operation of an absolute assignment of rights to land, including the assignee's sale of a chose of action by way of public auction without resorting to the remedies provided under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">the NLC</LINK>, although the document of title to the land has been issued at the time of the sale. In addition, it was also reiterated that there is no requirement under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> for the title to vest in the appellant and then for a charge to be executed before the security created in relation to the land can be realised by the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We agree with this contention. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;206.;;">Section 206(3) of the NLC</LINK>, by providing a liberal application of equity, recognises the contractual operation of any transaction relating to alienated land or any interest therein. In this regard, we see no reason as to why a similar recognition could not be accorded to the bank in exercising its power of sale over the land in accordance with the contractual provisions under the LACA. As discussed earlier, in the absence of any express provision in the statutes or the contractual provision governing the rights between the parties to the contrary, we are of the view that the bank is therefore entitled to exercise its power of sale under the LACA and to transfer the chose in action under the principal agreement to the purchaser by way of a further assignment. In addition, the facts that there was no charge created upon the issuance of the issue document of title to the land and no order for a judicial sale has been obtained by the bank do not prevent the bank from enforcing its rights under the LACA to proceed with the recovery action upon the default by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> At the close of submissions, learned counsel for the bank brought to our attention the importance of this case from the perspective of the banking and financial sectors in their loan transactions with borrowers. She mentioned the following common practices:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[43] Learned counsel then submitted that in this case, the title deed came out mid-way. If, as the appellant contends, the bank cannot effect an assignment sale but have to create a charge over the title first and then apply for an order for sale under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>, clearly the time and costs involved would be to the detriment of both:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We agree with that point of view as submitted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In conclusion, we make the following summary of our findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> For these reasons, we therefore answer the question of law posed in the affirmative and affirm the order of the Court of Appeal in reversing the decision of the High Court. In the premises, this appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
