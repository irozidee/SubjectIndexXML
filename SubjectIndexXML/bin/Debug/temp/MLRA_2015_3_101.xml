    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant and his wife were residents in a secured, gated housing estate ("the estate"). When the appellant moved into the estate in January 2007, two boom gates and a security guardhouse were already in place and functioning. The residents of the estate were required to pay monthly charges for the security and maintenance. Sometime in July 2007, the residents had also agreed that those who refused to pay the security and maintenance charges would not enjoy the facilities provided by guards at the boom gates or other security facilities. The appellant joined the estate's Resident's Association ("RA") and became its Treasurer from May 2009 to March 2010. During this period, the appellant raised no objections to the boom gates. The appellant left as member of the RA in August 2010 and stopped paying the maintenance and security charges. On 25 October 2011, the respondent issued a circular notifying the residents of the estate that those who had not paid the security and maintenance charges would have to personally open the boom gates without any assistance from the security guards, when entering the estate. The appellant, dissatisfied with the circular, lodged a police report and an online complaint with the local authority, Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya ("MBPJ"). The appellant thereafter sued the respondent on the grounds of <i>inter alia</i>, nuisance and that the boom gates and guardhouse were illegal structures that amounted to obstructions in law and ought to be demolished. The respondent counterclaimed for arrears of security and maintenance charges and for an injunction restraining the appellant from harassing the respondent's committee members and the security guards at the guardhouse. The High Court dismissed the appellant's action and allowed the respondent's counterclaim in part by issuing the injunction restraining the appellant from harassing the respondent and the security guards. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court's decision and the appellant appealed to the Federal Court. In the appeal, counsel contended <i>inter alia</i>, that the erecting of a guard house and boom gates across a public road in a residential area amounted to an obstruction within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974 ("SDBA")</LINK> and that both the High Court and the Court of Appeal failed to consider the application and implication of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK>. The principal issue to be decided herein was whether the guard house and boom gates were constructed with the approval of the local authority, ie MBPJ.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">Section 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> has no application where the local authority has given approval for the so-called obstruction complained of. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">Section 46(1)(a)</LINK> must be read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(3) of the SDBA</LINK> that empowers the local authority to remove an obstruction. UDA <i>Holdings Bhd v. Koperasi Pasaraya Malaysia Bhd &amp; Other Appeals (folld)</i>. (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The developer as predecessor to the respondent had obtained approval from the MBPJ under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">Town and Country Planning Act 1976 ("TCPA")</LINK> for the construction of the guard house, by the approval of the layout plan. Further, under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">SDBA</LINK>, the local authority has full supervisory authority over all buildings, both at the pre-construction and post-construction stages. By <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;70.;;">s 70(3) of the SDBA</LINK> the local authority is the approving authority for the erection of any building. MBPJ was thus the rightful authority for the approval of the guard house and the boom gates as "buildings" under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">SDBA</LINK>. (paras 17 &amp; 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;;">Local Government Act 1976 ("LGA")</LINK> empowers the local authority to do all things necessary for or conducive to the public safety, health and convenience. It could not be disputed that guarded communities are schemes implemented to improve public safety and security in defined residential areas. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The guard house and boom gates were duly authorised structures under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA</LINK>, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">SDBA</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;;">LGA</LINK> and could not therefore in law be an obstruction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK>. The MBPJ as the relevant local authority was fully empowered to approve the construction of buildings which could be in the nature of a guard house with boom gates. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Regulated access to a defined area is not an obstruction in law especially if it is for security purposes. It is so only if one is denied access to a public place. It is not a barricade that is placed across a public road that denies access altogether to all who wish to enter. In the instant case, the appellant did not complain that he or his family were prohibited from access at all or that the boom gates were a barricade against him or his family. The appellant's complaint was really a complaint of inconvenience and not of obstruction. (paras 23-24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> At common law, actionable obstruction or actionable private nuisance is not available for inconvenience. It is a matter of degree at all times and the conduct has to be unreasonable conduct in the circumstances of the case for it to be actionable. The underlying rule is a recognition that individuals live within a community and it is always the balancing of the individuals' inconvenience against the communities' interest that is of paramount concern. In the instant case, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal had correctly concluded that the appellant's inconvenience was not an actionable nuisance by the presence of the guard house and the boom gates.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin CJM:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the Court of Appeal in dismissing the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court at Shah Alam. The High Court had dismissed the appellant's claim against the respondent for nuisance and obstruction as well as for injunction and allowing the respondent's counterclaim for damages to the boom gates and for the order restraining the appellant from harassing the committee members of the respondent and the security guards.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal, the appellant sought and obtained leave from this court to appeal against the said decision on the following two questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The relevant backgrounds of the case may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned High Court Judge dismissed the appellant's claim and allowed the respondent's counterclaim in part, by issuing an injunction restraining  the appellant from harassing the respondent and the security guards. The learned High Court Judge <i>inter alia</i> held that:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The Court of Appeal on appeal by the appellant against the decision of the High Court affirmed the decision of the High Court and <i>inter alia</i> held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submission Of The Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On the first question raised for the determination of this court learned counsel for the appellant submitted that both the High Court and the Court of Appeal failed to consider the application and implication of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK>. This is despite the fact that the alleged obstructions are situated on a public road and were built without the prior approval of MBPJ. In any event, the appellant contended that the respondent did not operate the alleged obstructions in the manner allowed or approved by MBPJ. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">Section 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> As regards application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> and obstruction situated on a public road, learned counsel for the appellant referred to us a number of case authorities and amongst them is the High Court decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_3_103;"><i>Teoh Soon Kok T/A TSK Suppliers v. Yang Dipertua Majlis Daerah Kuala Muda</i> [1998] 3 MLRH 103</LINK>; [1998] 5 CLJ 790 wherein Mohd Hishamudin Yunus J (as he then was) held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It was submitted for the appellant that the word "boom gate" should rightfully fall within the term "post" as provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK>. The boom gate is in nature an obstruction placed on the public road by the respondent to impede the appellant's use of the said road. With regard to the facts of the case it was the contention of the appellant that in answer to the first question in the instant case, a guard house and a boom gate across a public road in a residential area amounted to an obstruction for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It was also the appellant's submission that the existence of the boom gate remained as an issue to be decided as the boom gate had not been included in the MBPJ approved plans of the guard house. Hence it was the appellant's contention that the respondent's operation of the boom gate in compelling the appellant to open the boom gate for himself and his visitors was clearly an obstruction pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK>. Therefore it was submitted that the first question is to be answered in the affirmative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On the second question posed in this appeal learned counsel for the appellant submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46 of the SDBA</LINK> on the face of it does not provide for the authorisation and/or approval of an obstruction. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">Section 46</LINK> deals with existence of an obstruction in any public place and the repercussions faced should one be guilty of causing an obstruction. It is apparent from the reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> that the power conferred to a local authority is only to remove obstructions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Similarly it was contended for the appellant that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> only empowers the local authority to arrest any person who builds, erects or maintains an obstruction. It is evident that the local authority has no duty to authorise or otherwise approve an obstruction within the definition of the said section.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Further, it was also submitted that the respondent's action of setting up the alleged obstruction in accordance with its own regulations is ultimately an attempt at regulating motor vehicles and traffic on public roads which it has no power or authority to do so. Such regulation is only permitted under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">Road Transport Act 1987</LINK>. (See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;70;;">ss 70</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;71.;;">71</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submission Of The Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Learned counsel for the respondent submitted in reply at the outset that the illegality issue was not the subject of the complaint of the appellant but was being deployed by him as a threat to obtain the assurance that the operation of the boom gate should not inconvenience him although he was not a paying resident. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal noted in its judgment that with regard to the illegality of the boom gates it is a non-issue in the appeal. The Court of Appeal further noted that only the issue of nuisance by the use of the boom gates remained to be decided. In the circumstances it was contended for the respondent that the illegality issue is not a live issue before this court. The illegality issue has become academic as it has ceased to be the real complaint to the appellant. This court was therefore invited by the respondent to decline to answer the question on illegality.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Notwithstanding the contention of the respondent that the Court of Appeal had made a finding that with regard to the illegality of the boom gate, it is a non-issue in the appeal, we take the view that the two questions posed in this appeal which relate to the illegality issue of the boom gate shall nevertheless be dealt with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The appellant relies on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> to contend that the boom gates are illegal as they constitute an obstruction over a public road. With respect, we do not agree with such a contention. On the scope of application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK>, it has been held by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_554;"><i>UDA Holdings Bhd v. Koperasi Pasaraya Malaysia Bhd &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 554</LINK>; [2009] 1 MLJ 737; [2009] 1 CLJ 329 that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> has no application where the local authority has given approval for the so-called obstruction complained of. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">Section 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> must be read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(3) of the SDBA</LINK> that empowers the local authority to remove an obstruction. Abdul Aziz Mohamad FCJ on this point held <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We are of the view that the principal issue to be decided in this case is whether the guard house and the boom gates were constructed with the approval of the relevant local authority, namely, the MBPJ. In this regard it is noted in 2002 there was the approval of the layout plan submitted by the Developer to the MBPJ that included provision for the building of a guard house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The layout plan for development is a requirement under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">Town and Country Planning Act 1976 ("the TCPA")</LINK>. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;5.;;">s 5 of TCPA</LINK> the local authority is the relevant planning authority for any local area. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;18.;;">ss 18</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;19.;;">19 of the TCPA</LINK> no development may take place in a local area without planning approval. By <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;21A.;;">s 21A(1)(f) of the TCPA</LINK> a development proposal must contain a layout plan. By <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;21B.;;">s 21B(c) of the TCPA</LINK> the layout plan must contain particulars of any building to be built. The definition of "building" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;2.;;">s 2 of the TCPA</LINK> is wide and includes "any house, shed or hut". We are of the view the developer as the predecessor to the respondent had thus obtained approval from the MBPJ for the construction of the guard house by the approval of the layout plan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is also to be noted that the construction of a guard house is invariably accompanied with the construction of a gate. In any event in the year 2012 there was a second approval from the MBPJ, after the gated and guarded community concept became popular. The approval was specific with regard to a guard house and accompanying boom gates. Initially the MBPJ's approval was for the boom gates to be down only from midnight to 6.00am. However, by a letter dated 30 January 2012 from the Officer in charge of the Police District (OCPD) for Kota Damansara had directed the respondent to keep the boom gate functional throughout the day to improve the security in the area.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We are of the view there could be no dispute over the authority of the MBPJ to issue the Guidelines for Guarded Communities and give approval in accordance therewith. The MBPJ Guidelines were issued in May 2011 by the Jabatan Perancang Bandar. Under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">SDBA</LINK> the local authority has full supervisory authority over all "buildings" both at the pre-construction and post-construction stage. Like under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA</LINK>, the term "building" is defined widely under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">SDBA</LINK> to include "any house, hut, shed .... gate" (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;3.;;">s 3</LINK>). By <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;70.;;">s 70(3) of the SDBA</LINK> the local authority is the approving authority for the erection of any building. It follows that the MBPJ is the rightful authority for the approval of the guard house and the boom gates as "buildings" under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">SDBA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In the context of the present case useful reference can be made to another statute, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;;">Local Government Act 1976 ("LGA")</LINK> which contained provision empowering the local authority to do all things necessary for or conducive to the public safety, health and convenience. (See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;101.;;">s 101(v)</LINK>). In this regard it cannot be disputed that guarded communities are schemes implemented to improve public safety and security in defined residential areas.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is our judgment that the guard house and boom gates are duly authorised structures under the relevant statues namely the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA</LINK>, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;;">SDBA</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;;">LGA</LINK> and cannot therefore in law be an obstruction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK> as posed by the first question in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On the approval issue posed in the second question in this appeal as to whether a local authority is empowered to approve an obstruction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_133;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the SDBA</LINK>, the answer to this argument in our view must be made by way of reference to the statutory provisions referred to in the preceding paragraphs. It is our finding that these provisions make it clear that the MBPJ, as the relevant local authority is fully empowered to approve the construction of "buildings" which may be in the nature of a guard house with boom gates.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We shall now deal with the issue of nuisance. It is noted that the two questions posed in this appeal are premised on the assumption that operating a security gate system in a residential area is an actionable obstruction in law. In our view this is clearly wrong. A regulated access to a defined area is not an obstruction in law especially if it is for security purposes. It is so only if one is denied access to a public place. It is not a barricade that is placed across a public road that denies access altogether to all who wish to enter. The MBPJ Guidelines, on which the January 2012 approval was given, addresses this issue. The Guidelines in relation to a guarded community deal with the rights of those residents who opt not to participate in the security scheme. It says in para 2(f) of the Guidelines as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It is noted in the present case that the appellant does not complain that he or his family are prohibited from access at all or that the boom gates are a barricade against him or his family. His complaint is that he is inconvenienced because he has to engage in self-service to lift the gate. In short, the appellant's complaint in reality is a complaint of inconvenience and not of obstruction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> At common law, both actionable obstruction or actionable private nuisance is not available for inconvenience. The decided cases have shown that it is a matter of degree at all times and the conduct has to be unreasonable conduct in the circumstances of the case for it to be actionable. In <i>Trevett &amp; Anor v. Lee &amp; Anor</i> [1955] 1 WLR 113, Lord Evershed observed that the question whether a householder is or is not obstructing the highway so as to give rise to cause of action is to be judged by balancing on standards of reasonableness, the claims and conduct of the householder on the one side and the members of the public on the other. Lord Evershed adopted the rule propounded by Romer J in <i>Lingke v. Mayor of Christchurch</i> [1912] 3 KB 595 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We are of the view the underlying rule is a recognition that individuals live within a community and it is always the balancing of the individuals' inconvenience against the communities' interest that is of paramount concern. On this point in <i>Goerge Philip &amp; Ors v. Subbammal &amp; Ors</i> [1957] AIR Trav-Co 281, the High Court in India observed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It is our judgment that both the High Court and the Court of Appeal had correctly concluded that the appellant's inconvenience was not an actionable nuisance by the presence of the guard house and the boom gates.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For the reasons abovestated on the facts and circumstances of the present case, the first question posed in this appeal is answered in the negative. As to the second question posed we do not find it necessary to answer it as it is too general and not based on specific factual circumstances. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</p>
