    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The 1st plaintiff, a successful entertainer, was engaged to the 2nd plaintiff, a law lecturer and former Deputy Public Prosecutor. The 1st plaintiff was given up for adoption as an infant, and due to a family dispute, had never met her biological family. After her engagement, the 1st plaintiff's adopted mother assured the 1st plaintiff that she would assist the 1st plaintiff to approach her biological father to be the 'wali mujbir'. However, the biological father refused to do so. Because the wedding ceremonies had been fixed and much preparation for the marriage had been made, the plaintiffs had to solemnise their marriage in Thailand through a 'wali hakim'. Soon after such solemnisation, the Hulu Langat Syariah Court issued an order declaring the plaintiffs' marriage as valid according to hukum syara'. The 1st defendant - a free-to-air television channel, regularly aired over its channel a programme entitled 'Melodi' ('the programme') produced by the 2nd and 3rd defendants. On 26 June 2011, the programme was recorded and broadcasted live. In the programme, several words touching on the 1st plaintiff's marriage in Thailand and her dispute with her biological father and biological family were aired. The programme was repeated on air on 6 July 2011. On 9 July 2011, the programme was uploaded to an Internet portal operated by the 4th defendant, making the programme accessible on demand globally. The plaintiffs claimed these words were defamatory and sued the defendants for defamation in the High Court. The plaintiffs claimed that the words carried two injurious effects. Firstly, the allegation that the plaintiffs had married without a 'wali' carried the meaning that the plaintiffs' marriage was void, the plaintiffs were living in adultery and sin and that their infant child was illegitimate. Secondly, that the 1st plaintiff had made statements that she had met her biological father and that he refused to be her 'wali', would result in the 1st plaintiff being called a liar, a scoundrel and an insolent daughter to her parents. The High Court found the defendants liable, decided in the plaintiffs' favour and ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs a sum of RM250,000 as damages, inclusive of aggravated and exemplary damages. The defendants appealed against liability and quantum of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the defendants' appeal on liability and allowing the appeal on quantum):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> On the issue of liability, the findings of the High Court judge were clearly justified based on oral and contemporaneous evidence led during the trial. It had not been successfully shown on appeal, how the findings of the High Court judge on liability was against the weight of evidence or perverse in any way. The decision of the High Court judge on the issue of liability ought to be affirmed. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The principal remedy sought by the plaintiffs was for an award of damages. Since libel had been established, as a matter of general rule, the law would presume some damage would result in the ordinary course when the defendants invaded another's absolute right to reputation. The general rule is that the law would assess damages on a purely compensatory basis. This would include any resultant social disadvantage, and compensation for the natural grief and distress, which the plaintiffs might feel as a result of the statement having been published. The damages awarded would operate both as a vindication of the plaintiffs to the public and as a consolation to them for the wrong done. The amount of damages would be governed by all the circumstances of the particular case, including the position and standing of the plaintiffs, the nature of the libel and the whole conduct of the defendants from the time when the libel was published to very moment of its decision. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The House of Lords decision in <i>Rookes v. Barnard</i> recognised three broad categories where exemplary damages may be awarded. The first category is where the plaintiff is injured by the oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the executive or the servant of the government. The second category comprised those cases in which the defendant's conduct has been calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff. The third category is where a statute has expressly authorised it. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, there was no basis for any exemplary damages, which is punitive in nature, to be even considered under any of the three categories propounded in <i>Rookes v. Barnard</i>. On the contrary, the 1st to 4th defendants published the programme in response to calls for help by the 1st plaintiff's biological family members. It was a programme designed to heal broken family relationships. There was no suggestion that the programme was a scheme calculated to make profits for the defendants. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Aggravated damages are still compensatory in nature. Aggravated damages may be awarded within the compensatory principles if there has been any kind of high-handed, oppressive, insulting or contumelious behaviour by the defendant which increases the mental pain and suffering, caused by the defamation and which may constitute injury to the plaintiff's pride and self-confidence. In the instant case, there was no evidence that the defendants had acted in any highhanded, oppressive, insulting or contumelious manner. The defendants had broadcasted the news in question without malice, to disseminate information of a public interest. There was no evidence at all that there was any deliberate conduct on the part of the defendants to oppress or insult the plaintiffs. Any claim for aggravated damages had therefore been rejected to be without basis. The High Court judge was thus plainly wrong in awarding exemplary and aggravated damages. (paras 33-36)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Azahar Mohamed JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In the High Court, the two respondents sued the five appellants for defamation in relation to a television programme entitled 'Melodi' (the Melodi programme) of materials, which the respondents alleged questioned the respondents' marriage in Thailand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We shall be referring to parties in this judgment in their respective capacity in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiffs' case was that the said Melodi programme, whether viewed in totality or otherwise, had published defamatory words, which questioned the validity of the plaintiffs' marriage, and had published the private issues between the plaintiffs and the 1st plaintiff's biological family.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The High Court had, after a full trial, allowed the plaintiffs' claim and ordered the defendants to pay RM250,000.00 as damages with interest and costs fixed at RM70,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Aggrieved by the whole decision of the High Court, all the defendants filed an appeal to this court. We heard the appeal. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeals, by unanimous decision, we decided:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Following our decision, the plaintiffs had filed an application for leave to appeal to the Federal Court on the issue of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We now give our reasons for setting aside the award of damages made by the High Court in the sum of RM250,000.00 and substituting it with an award in the sum of RM80,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The facts of the case are well set out in the judgment of the learned High Court Judge. Very briefly the background facts giving rise to the appeal are as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The plaintiffs are a married couple. In 2004, the 1st plaintiff was a contestant in the ASTRO organised talent contest "Akademi Fantasia Musim Ke-2" (AF2) and she had successfully advanced to the final rounds. From 2004 onwards and subsequent to the AF2 show, the 1st plaintiff's career as a singer and entertainer blossomed. She achieved something of a celebrity status.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The 2nd plaintiff is a law lecturer at a local university. Prior to his career as a lecturer, he was a Deputy Public Prosecutor at the Attorney General's Chambers, Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The 1st plaintiff was born to the couple, Encik Zawawi and Puan Dara in Kuching, Sarawak. The 1st plaintiff was given away by her biological family for adoption to a childless couple when she was still an infant. Shortly after the 1st plaintiff was given away for adoption, her biological and adoptive families were involved in a family dispute and were intensely hostile towards each other ever since. Due to the family dispute, she was never introduced to her biological family.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The 1st plaintiff met the 2nd plaintiff in 2010 and they later got engaged in February 2011. It was during the engagement that the bride's wedding ceremonies were fixed on 28 May 2011 and 29 May 2011 and the groom's side a week later on 3 June 2011 (the wedding ceremonies).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> After the engagement, her adopted mother had assured the 1st plaintiff that she would assist her to approach her biological father in regard to her "wali mujbir" ("wali" by way of blood relation) arrangement. As events turned out, the 1st plaintiff's biological father refused to be her "wali". As a result of which on 23 April 2011, the plaintiffs' marriage was solemnised at the Islamic Council of Narathiwat Province, Thailand by way of "wali hakim".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It was the plaintiffs' case that the solemnisation had to be done in order to save the wedding ceremonies as all the preparation had been undertaken, including purchasing air flight tickets, chartering accommodation and transport for the groom's family/relatives. On 26 May 2011, Mahkamah Syariah Hulu Langat issued a court order declaring that the plaintiffs' marriage is valid according to hukum syara'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The 1st defendant is a company operating a leading free-to-air television channel in Malaysia (also known as TV3). The 2nd defendant is one of the 1st defendant's producers. The 3rd defendant is one of the 1st defendant's television journalists/producers. The 4th defendant is a company operating the website www.tonton.com.my on which the Melodi programme can be viewed. The 5th defendant is one of the biological brothers of the 1st plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Amongst the many popular programmes aired regularly over the 1st defendant's television channel is one entitled 'Melodi'. 'Melodi' is a lighthearted infotainment programme focusing largely on the local entertainment scene. 'Melodi' also features, at times, a segment dedicated to public complaints, especially involving celebrities in the spotlight.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The Melodi programme which was aired on 26 June 2011 contained a segment on the family dispute between the 1st plaintiff and her biological family. It also contained materials consisting of statements and visuals regarding the plaintiffs' marriage in Thailand. It was also shown live on the same day at the Jom Heboh Carnival at Stadium Likas, Sabah, the venue where the Melodi programme was recorded. On 6 July 2011, the Melodi programme was aired again on or about 12:30pm to 1:30pm. On 9 July 2011, the Melodi programme was also uploaded to the Internet portal of www.tonton.com.my and thus is accessible online anytime and anywhere by anyone in the world.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Melodi programme was in the form of an infotainment report touching on the 1st plaintiff's marriage in Thailand where it was alleged that the 1st plaintiff's biological father had refused to be her "wali" although she tried to persuade him to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Melodi programme had amongst others, published the following words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> According to the plaintiffs, the words have the effect of casting a slur on the plaintiffs' character and reputation, and were therefore defamatory of the plaintiffs. It was the plaintiffs' case that that there were two stings in this case, which materially injured the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The first sting, is that the plaintiffs were alleged to be married without a "wali", which carried the meaning that the plaintiffs' marriage is void, and the plaintiffs have been living in adultery and sin all this while. The plaintiffs' offspring, and in this instance their infant child, Nasuha, would carry the taboo of illegitimacy all her life.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The second sting, that the 1st plaintiff had made statements that she had met her biological father and that he had refused to be her "wali", would result in the 1st plaintiff being called a liar, a scoundrel and an insolent daughter to her parents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned High Court Judge found in favour of the plaintiffs. It is undisputed that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs were married in Thailand and subsequently their marriage was registered at the Hulu Langat Syariah Court. The learned High Court Judge found that the issue of "wali" was a matter of hukum syara' for Muslims. Violation of that hukum syara' would carry a reprehensible consequence, as the issue of adultery, fornication and the status of legitimacy of the children out of the relationship would arise. The learned High Court Judge found that the defendants' case was placed on the wrong footing that the solemnisation ceremony in Thailand did not require a "wali" for a Muslim marriage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned High Court Judge found that the 3rd defendant, during the airing of the Melodi programme on 26 June 2011, had full knowledge that the plaintiffs' wedding was declared valid by Mahkamah Syariah Hulu Langat on 26 May 2011 but decided not to reveal this crucial fact in the Melodi programme.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On the issue of liability, as a primary trier of fact, the learned High Court Judge, as disclosed in her judgment, had carefully scrutinised, weighed all the evidence and adopted the correct approach before deciding that the words in question were defamatory of the plaintiffs and that the defendants had failed in their defences of justification and qualified privilege. In our judgment, on the issue of liability, the findings of the learned High Court Judge were clearly justified based on oral and contemporaneous evidence led during the trial. It has not been successfully shown to us that the findings of the learned High Court Judge on liability was against the weight of evidence or perverse in any way. We had therefore affirmed the decision of the learned High Court Judge on the issue of liability.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> When it came to the issue of award of damages, the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, with respect, ran into difficulties. As we have said earlier, the learned High Court Judge ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs a sum of RM250,000.00 as damages with interest. The reasons for awarding the said sum can be seen in the following passage of her judgment, with the necessary emphasis:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As can be seen, the High Court's award of RM250,000.00 includes aggravated and exemplary damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Before us, the learned counsel for the defendants submitted that the damages awarded at RM250,000.00 were manifestly excessive; there was absolutely no basis for any aggravated or exemplary damages to be awarded. The learned counsel urged us to consider that the dispute in this unfortunate case concerned a family conflict. He added that the 1st to 4th defendants (collectively forming the media) were caught in the conflict when they sought to discharge their public duties by providing media coverage relating to this unfortunate case. Their coverage of this case was to intercede in the conflict. He added that it was a genuine good faith attempt to mend the family, but the plaintiffs instead sued them for defamation. In the circumstances, according to the learned counsel, if at all, the plaintiffs were only entitled to compensatory damages to appease the plaintiffs' injured feelings, and no aggravated or exemplary damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In asserting their position that the award of RM250,000.00 was fair and reasonable, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs argued that the reckless act of the defendants in defaming the plaintiffs had caused embarrassment, pain and irreparable damage to the plaintiffs. The insinuation of adultery and illegitimacy of their children will now haunt the plaintiffs for the rest of their lives. Therefore, the learned counsel argued that it was clear that the learned High Court Judge had arrived at her decision on the award correctly on the basis of relevant laws and the established evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In the present case, the principal remedy sought by the plaintiffs was for an award of damages. Since libel had been established, as a matter of general rule, the law presumed some damage will result in the ordinary course when a defendant invades another's absolute right to reputation (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1939_1_405;"><i>Cheong Chark v. Gammon (Malaya) Ltd</i> [1939] 1 MLRH 405</LINK>; [1939] 1 MLJ 65). The general rule is that the law assesses damage on a purely compensatory basis. This will include any resultant social disadvantage, and compensation for the natural grief and distress, which the plaintiff might feel as a result of the statement having been published (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1979_1_150;"><i>Datuk Patinggi Abdul Rahman Ya'kub v. Abang Mohammad Bin Abang Anding</i> [1979] 1 MLRH 150</LINK>). The damages awarded operate both as a vindication of the plaintiff to the public and as a consolation to him for the wrong done (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1973_1_153;"><i>Syed Husin Ali v. Sharikat Penchetakan Utusan Melayu Berhad &amp; Anor</i> [1973] 1 MLRH 153</LINK>; [1973] 2 MLJ 56). The amount of damages will be governed by all the circumstances of the particular case, including the position and standing of the plaintiffs, the nature of the libel and the whole conduct of the defendant from the time when the libel was published to very moment of its decision (see <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i>, 8th edn pp 592-593).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The most important authority for the award of exemplary damages is the House Lords decision in <i>Rookes v. Barnard</i> [1964] AC 1129. This decision recognised three broad categories where exemplary damages may be awarded. The first category is of those cases where the plaintiff is injured by the oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the executive or the servant of the government. The second category is comprised of those cases in which the defendant's conduct has been calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff. The third category is where a statute has expressly authorised it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Clearly, in the present case, there is absolutely no basis for any exemplary damages, which is punitive in nature, to be even considered under any of the three categories as propounded by <i>Rookes v. Barnard (supra)</i>. On the contrary, the 1st to 4th defendants published the Melodi programme in response to the calls for help by the biological family members. The matter extended beyond just responding to the call for help. It was a programme designed to heal broken family relationships. There was no suggestion that the programme was a scheme calculated to make profits for the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In most defamation cases, aggravated damages are often claimed together with exemplary damages. But then it is not the same and must be differentiated from the punitive purpose of exemplary damages; in that aggravated damages is still compensatory in nature. Aggravated damages may be awarded within the compensatory principles if there has been any kind of high-handed, oppressive, insulting or contumelious behavior by the defendant which increases the mental pain and suffering, which is caused by the defamation and which may constitute injury to the plaintiff's pride and self-confidence (see <i>McCarey v. Associated Newspapers Ltd</i> [1964] 3 All ER 947).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In the present case, there was no evidence that the defendants acted in any high-handed, oppressive, insulting or contumelious manner. The defendants broadcasted the news in question without malice to disseminate information of a public interest. In particular, the 1st to 4th defendants were trying to intercede in this sad and regrettable family dispute to repair the cracks between the families.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> There was no evidence at all that there was any deliberate conduct on the part of the defendants to oppress or insult the plaintiffs. Any claim for aggravated damages must therefore be rejected to be plainly without basis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> For all the reasons stated, we held that there had not been established circumstances in the present case justifying either exemplary or aggravated damages, which the learned High Court Judge awarded in this case. The learned High Court Judge, with respect, was plainly wrong in awarding exemplary and aggravated damages. On the evidence of the present case, we found no evidence of any kind of high-handed, oppressive, insulting or contumelious behavior by the defendants which increased the mental pain and suffering of the plaintiffs. There was no basis to award exemplary and aggravated damages but the award of RM250,000.00 included such damages, which was plainly wrong</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In consequence, this case was one for compensation in respect of the injury to the plaintiffs' reputation and honour. In the circumstances of this case, having considered the plaintiffs' position and standing as well as the nature of the defamation, which arose out of an unhappy case of family conflict, we held that a sum of RM80,000.00 by way of compensatory damages for both the plaintiffs was fair and reasonable to compensate them for the pain and suffering they had endured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We had therefore allowed the defendants' appeal only to this extent. The award of damages made by the High Court in the sum of RM250,000.00 was set aside and substituted with an award in the sum of RM80,000.00.</p>
