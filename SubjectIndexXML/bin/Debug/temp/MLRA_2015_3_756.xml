    <p>The 1st respondent was the holder of an iron-ore mining lease on a piece of land ("the land") from 1 October 2001 till 31 December 2007. The appellant was a mining company that had been granted permission to mine the said land. On 20 June 2005, the appellant and the 1st respondent entered into a settlement agreement ("SA") to settle all outstanding legal proceedings against each other. It was mutually agreed that with the payment of specified sums by the appellant to the 1st respondent, the SA was to be the governing contract between the parties for the remaining period of the mining lease. The appellant continued its mining operations until December 2007 paying a tribute of RM10 per metric dry ton on the iron ore extracted pursuant to the SA. The SA provided <i>inter alia</i> that upon the expiry of the mining lease and upon an extension of time granted by the Authorities to the 1st respondent, the 1st respondent would grant to the appellant "first option the right to mine and the rate of tribute and the extended period shall be renegotiated and agreed upon between the parties". The SA also provided that if the parties could not agree on the re-negotiations the matter was to be referred to a suitable arbitrator for determination. It was the appellant's case that on 10 October 2007, its Managing Director ("PW1") had met the 1st respondent for negotiations on the tribute to be payable during the extended period commencing 1 January 2008 at the Seasons Hotel, Kuantan, where it was orally agreed that the appellant would pay a tribute at the rate of RM20 per metric dry ton on all iron ore extracted. The 1st respondent, however, denied any such agreement, and laid down his terms for an extension of the contract, <i>inter alia</i> requiring the appellant to pay a sum of USD1 million to purchase the right to the mine for five years and to pay a tribute at the rate of RM35 per metric dry ton for all iron ore extracted. The appellant applied to the High Court for, <i>inter alia</i>, an order of specific performance of the SA and an order declaring the appellant the rightful owner of a stockpile of iron ore on the land. The 1st respondent counterclaimed and in his counterclaim, he <i>inter alia</i>, sought an order to declare the SA cancelled and of no further effect and that there was no agreement reached on the extension of the contract. The application for an extension of the mining lease was made in the name of the 1st respondent but at the request of the 1st respondent, the lease was transferred into the name of the 2nd respondent. The appellant's cause of action against the 2nd respondent was that it was the alter ego of the 1st respondent, and the appellant sought to lift the corporate veil of the 2nd respondent. The High Court dismissed the appellant's claim save for an order that the stockpile of iron ore on the land belonged to the appellant. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the said decision. The main issue that arose was whether there was an oral agreement between PW1, acting on behalf of the appellant, and the 1st respondent on the extension of the contract and the new rate of tribute payable by the appellant to the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The finding of the trial judge was erroneous as it was against the weight of the evidence adduced. The appellant had successfully proven, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an oral agreement reached between the parties and, accordingly, the SA ought to be extended with the appellant having to pay a tribute at the rate of RM20 per metric dry ton on all iron ore extracted to the 1st respondent. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Although generally an appellate court should be slow to interfere with the findings of fact by the trial judge who had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and assessing their evidence during the trial, the exception to the general rule is that an appellate court is duty bound to intervene and correct erroneous findings of facts by the court where the trial judge was plainly wrong in arriving at his/her decision or when there has been insufficient judicial appreciation of the evidence adduced. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> On the facts, an oral agreement had been reached on 10 October 2007 between the parties for various reasons. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Although there was a provision in the SA for a dispute to be referred to arbitration, the fact that neither party took steps to refer to a suitable arbitrator did not disentitle the appellant from filing its claim in court for the several reliefs sought. If the 1st respondent had wanted to seriously challenge the appellant's claim from being filed in court, he could have applied for a stay of the proceedings pending reference to an arbitrator. The 1st respondent did not do so and had in fact submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by filing his defence and counterclaim. (para 24.2 &amp; 24.4)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In so far as the cause of action against the 2nd respondent was concerned, it was proper to order the veil of incorporation to be lifted to reveal the true status of the 2nd respondent. It was obvious that the 2nd respondent was incorporated as a 'front' for the 1st respondent and was in fact an agent of the 1st respondent. The 1st respondent remained the controlling mind and will of the 2nd respondent. The court was satisfied that the mining lease was for all intents and purposes extended in favour of the 1st respondent. The appellant and the 1st respondent had indeed reached an agreement on 10 October 2007 to extend the SA at the tribute rate payable at RM20 per metric dry ton of iron ore. The judge was correct to hold that the stockpile of iron ore on the land rightfully belonged to the appellant. (paras 25-27)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mah Weng Kwai JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The 1st respondent was at all material times the holder of a mining lease to mine for iron ore on a piece of land measuring about 1000 acres in Mukim Keratong in the District of Rompin, Pahang. The licence was for the period from 1 October 2001 till 31 December 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant was at all material times a mining company which had been granted permission to carry on mining on the said land. The appellant paid for the premium, mining tax, survey fees and other expenses before commencing mining operations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 20 June 2005, the appellant and the 1st respondent entered into a settlement agreement to settle all outstanding legal proceedings against each other. It was mutually agreed that with the payment of specified sums by the appellant to the 1st respondent the settlement agreement was to be the governing contract between the parties for the remaining period of the mining lease.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant continued its mining operations from 20 June 2005 till December 2007 paying a tribute of RM10 per metric dry ton on the iron ore extracted "if the total dry tonnage extracted in the month is 5000 dry tons or less" pursuant to cl 9.1 of the settlement agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Clause 13 of the settlement agreement provided that upon expiry of the mining lease and upon an extension of time being granted by the mining authorities to the 1st respondent, the 1st respondent would grant to the appellant "first option the right to mine and the rate of tribute and extended period shall be renegotiated and agreed upon between the parties".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It was further provided in cl 13 that if the parties could "not agree on the re-negotiations the matter shall be referred to a suitable arbitrator for determination".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It was the appellant's case that its Managing Director, Mr Lee Shing U (PW1) had met the 1st respondent (DW3) and his wife, Datin Razmah binti Zainuddin (DW1) for negotiations on the tribute to be payable during the extended period commencing from 1 January 2008 at the Seasons Hotel in Kuantan on or about 10 October 2007 and that it was orally agreed that the appellant would pay a tribute at the rate of RM20 per metric dry ton on all iron ore extracted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The 1st respondent in his defence, not unexpectedly, denied any such agreement to accept a tribute at the rate of RM20 per metric dry ton offered by the appellant. Instead, the 1st respondent, through his solicitor's letter of 31 December 2007, laid down his terms for an extension of the contract. The appellant was required to:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant was to accept the 1st respondent's offer within seven days from the date of the letter and that in the interim the appellant was "to refrain from carrying out any activity at the site".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant did not respond to the 1st respondent's solicitor's letter of 31 December 2007 but instead filed its claim to protect its interests in the High Court, Kuantan for <i>inter alia</i>, an order of specific performance of the settlement agreement (pertaining to the option); damages; a permanent injunction; a declaration that the appellant is the rightful owner of the stockpile of iron ore on the land and a declaration that the 2nd respondent is the alter ego of the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In his counterclaim the 1st respondent <i>inter alia</i>, sought an order to declare the settlement agreement cancelled and of no further effect; that there was no agreement reached on the extension of the contract and the new rate of tribute; an injunction to restrain the appellant from carrying out any mining activity and an order for the appellant to remove all its machinery from the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The application for an extension of the mining lease was made in the name of the 1st respondent but at the request of the 1st respondent, the lease was transferred into the name of the 2nd respondent, for a period of five years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant's cause of action against the 2nd respondent was that it was the alter ego of the 1st respondent with the shareholders and Directors of the 2nd respondent being family members of the 1st respondent. The appellant sought to lift the corporate veil of the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In its defence, the 2nd respondent denied it was an agent and alter ego of the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> After a full trial, the learned judge dismissed the appellant's claim save for an order that the stockpile of iron ore on the land belonged to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Being dissatisfied with the decision, the appellant filed its appeal. Neither the 1st respondent nor the 2nd respondent filed an appeal or cross-appeal against the decision of the learned judge made in respect of the stockpile of iron ore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Upon reading the written submissions of counsel for the appellant and the respondents and upon hearing the oral submissions of counsel aforesaid, the court unanimously allowed the appeal with costs. The order of the High Court was set aside save for the order on the stockpile of iron ore left on the land. The court held that the settlement agreement between the parties is still binding, valid and subsisting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Being dissatisfied with the decision, the respondents have filed an application for leave to appeal to the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Central to the arguments in this appeal is the issue of whether there was an oral agreement reached between PW1, acting on behalf of the appellant and the 1st respondent on the extension of the contract and the new rate of tribute payable by the appellant to the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> If the court had agreed with the finding of the learned judge that there was no oral agreement reached between the parties on 10 October 2007 at the Seasons Hotel in Kuantan, then the 1st respondent would have been quite justified in making his offer of extension upon the new terms as stated in his solicitor's letter of 31 December 2007 to the appellant. And as the appellant chose not to accept the offer (or even make a counter offer) then of course, the settlement agreement would have lapsed upon its expiration on 31 December 2007 and that would have been the end of the appellant's claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> However, we are of the view that the finding of the learned judge was erroneous as it was against the weight of the evidence adduced. We are of the view that the appellant had successfully proved, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an oral agreement reached between the parties and accordingly, the settlement agreement ought to be extended with the appellant having to pay a tribute at the rate of RM20 per metric dry ton on all iron ore extracted to the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We are mindful of the law that an appellate court should be slow to interfere with the findings of fact by a learned trial judge who had the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses and assessing their evidence during the trial. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_432;"><i>Sivalingam Periasamy v. Periasamy &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 432</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 395; [1996] 4 CLJ 545; [1996] 3 AMR 3506 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_1;"><i>Gan Yook Chin &amp; Anor v. Lee Ing Chin &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 1; [2004] 4 CLJ 309; [2004] 6 AMR 781). But, we are equally mindful of the exception to the general rule, that is, an appellate court is duty bound to intervene and correct erroneous findings of facts by the court where the learned trial judge was plainly wrong in arriving at his/her decision or when there has been insufficient judicial appreciation of the evidence adduced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We find that on the facts, an oral agreement had been reached on 10 October 2007 between the parties for the following reasons:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The non-referral of the dispute to arbitration issue:-</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In so far as the cause of action against the 2nd respondent is concerned, we are of the view that it is proper in this case to order the veil of incorporation to be lifted to reveal the true status of the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent was incorporated with the 1st respondent being the majority shareholder, holding 109,998 shares. The other shareholders are his wife (DW1) and children. The 1st respondent, his wife and their children are directors of the company. It will be remembered from the facts that the application for the extension of the lease was made in the name of the 1st respondent but at the request of the 1st respondent, the mining lease was extended for five years in the name of the 2nd respondent. It is obvious that the 2nd respondent was incorporated as a 'front' for the 1st respondent and is in fact an agent of the 1st respondent. The 1st respondent remained as the controlling mind and will of the 2nd respondent (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1979_1_197;"><i>Hotel Jaya Puri Bhd v. National Union Of Hotel, Bar &amp; Restaurant Workers &amp; Anor</i> [1979] 1 MLRH 197</LINK>; [1980] 1 MLJ 109 per Salleh Abas FJ). The court is satisfied that the mining lease was for all intents and purposes extended in favour of the 1st respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In light of the above facts, we are of the view that the appellant and the 1st respondent had reached an agreement on 10 October 2007 to extend the settlement agreement at the tribute rate payable at RM20 per metric dry ton of iron ore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We are further of the view that the learned judge was correct to hold that the stockpile of iron ore on the land rightfully belonged to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In the result, the appellant's appeal was allowed with costs, that is, the claim was allowed and the respondents' counterclaim was dismissed. The deposit was refunded.</p>
