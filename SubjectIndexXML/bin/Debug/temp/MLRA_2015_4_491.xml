    <p>The appellant was convicted for the offence of rape punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;376.;;">s 376 of the Penal Code</LINK>, and was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. The victim, who was 15 years of age at the time of the incident, told the court that the appellant had sexual intercourse at four different occasions that took place in May, June, July and August 2011. After several months the victim became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy. The mother of the victim thereafter lodged a police report and, subsequently, the appellant was arrested. The results of a DNA profiling test revealed that the appellant was the biological father of the child. At the end of the prosecution case, the trial judge found that the prosecution had established a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant and the appellant was called to enter his defence. The appellant filed an appeal, seeking acquittal, on the following grounds, amongst others, that (a) the prosecution had failed to call the inn-keeper of the hotel (where the offence allegedly took place) to explain the absence of the names of the appellant and the victim in the register; (b) there was an absence of penile penetration, as the pregnancy was due to the introduction of semen by fingers and was inserted into the vagina;(c) the victim's evidence was not adequately corroborated; and(d) there should not have been four charges in one trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal, and setting aside his conviction and sentence):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> An adverse inference is drawn if there is withholding or suppression of evidence and not merely on account of failure to obtain evidence. In the instant case, the failure of the prosecution to call the inn-keeper who kept the register of record entry of the hotel therefore could not lead to an adverse inference being invoked. Furthermore, the fact that the names of the appellant and victim werenot registered did not mean that they were not there. (paras 30 &amp; 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It is not the law that the testimony of a sexual complainant or that of a minor must necessarily be corroborated in every material particular. A trial judge may convict upon the uncorroborated testimony if the judge, having warned himself of the danger of convicting upon uncorroborated testimony, was nevertheless satisfied that it was safe to do so on the uncorroborated testimony. Hence, the significance of the DNA evidence that the appellant was the father of the child borne by the victim could not be under estimated. It provided conclusive evidence that the spermatozoa of the appellant fertilised the ova of victim. Nonetheless, the question was whether the fertilisation of the victim's ova by the appellant's spermatozoa was as a consequence of the alleged rapes as charged. (paras 35-36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;165.;;">Section 165(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code ('CPC')</LINK> provided that if in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one were committed by the same person, he may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence. In the instant case, the alleged incidents took place in different months. Although they involved the same accused person, same victim, same offence and same place, they involved separate offences of rape. Four rapes in over four months could not form one transaction, even if by the same accused upon the same victim and in the same place. This was an illegality which could not be cured by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;422.;;">s 422 of the CPC</LINK>. (paras 41-45)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Based on the testimony of the appellant, he did not have intercourse with the victim. Rather, he used his fingers which had semen on them, to penetrate. This had led to fertilisation and conception, resulting in the birth of a child. In the light of the conclusiveness of the DNA that he was the biological father, it could be concluded that it was the answer of an ordinary person who did not expect that use of fingers could result in fertilisation and conception. (paras 70-72)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Upon a maximum evaluation of the evidence adduced, the supposition that fertilisation occurred in this case by the introduction or delivery of semen by fingers, was no longer "but not in the least probable", but became a reasonable doubt because due to the testimony of Dr Nurulhuda, the O&amp;G Specialist ('PW8'), there was the testimony of the appellant that fingers had been so used.The confirmation by PW8 made the challenged but unshaken testimony ofthe appellant just at the very least bit probable as to raise a reasonable doubt. (para 75)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Obiter:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> This was clearly a case that the defence of the appellant was put to the prosecution witnesses. The prosecution had notice of the defence. A material prosecution witness, PW8, testified that fertilisation of ova by introduction of fresh semen by fingers was possible. No steps were taken to call a more experienced doctor to give evidence to explain away the testimony of PW8. There was no excuse on the record for not obtaining expert evidence that could be called to counter it. Thus, the court was left with one inference, that the prosecution accepted the confirmation by PW8. Since the burden at all times remained upon the prosecution to prove the offence as charged to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt, no charge should be filed for prosecution unless and until the prosecution was certain it could do so. There was after all no statute of limitation to crime. (paras 76-77)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Rape is even more an outrage if it results in conception. Causing conception on a woman without her consent or a minor who cannot consent is an assault no less than rape resulting in conception. Steps ought to be taken quickly to add to the definition of rape. In the instant case, it was not appropriate to consider convicting the appellant on lesser charges such as of indecent assault lest it lends to the notion that the courts condone such lesser charges as sufficient charge and punishment, and detract from the urgency of introducing necessary legislation. No doubt the prosecution felt compelled to charge the appellant for rape with no alternative charges for the very same reason that lesser charges were wholly inadequate. (paras 78-79)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, Bunya Anak Jalong (I/C No: 541004-13-5351) appealed against the dismissal by the High Court in Sibu of his appeal against his convictions by the Sessions Court in Sibu and the sentences as varied by the said High Court on four charges of rape as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Charges</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant was charged, tried, convicted and sentenced before the said Sessions Court on the following charges:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;;">Penal Code</LINK> provides a punishment upon conviction of a term of imprisonment which may extend to 20 years, and of imprisonment for a term of not less than five years and not more than thirty years in the case of the offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;376.;;">s 376(1)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;376.;;">376(2)</LINK> respectively, and in both cases the offender shall also be liable to whipping.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Basic Principles Of Criminal Law</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As in the case of consideration of every criminal appeal, we bear in mind the following, as should every investigator, prosecutor and member of the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> So that the traumatic experience of any offence can be put to rest, victims of offences, persons affected directly or indirectly, and right-thinking persons expect offenders to be punished. But few offences attract such utter revulsion and outrage as rape, an offence not only of a physical assault but also upon the gender and psyche of the victim, whether adult or a child. It must be a permanent blot upon the offender's character and reputation. Every right thinking person is anxious to see to it the offender is punished, that justice is served and the victim is compensated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The criminal law recognises the danger that the desire to punish an offender can result in an innocent person accused of an offence being punished. The "Blackstone Ratio", attributed to English jurist William Blackstone, in his <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford between 1765 and 1769 is widely summed up as that "it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent person shall suffer".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> That balancing between that offenders must be brought to justice and no innocent person shall suffer is achieved by (a) structuring of the administration of the criminal law, and (b) the standard of proof.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The administration of justice is structured as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The duty of the investigators is to investigate the facts and to collect all the evidence. The police as investigators are public officers. Their concern must be to investigate the facts without fear or favour, so that all wrong-doers may be brought to justice. The completed investigation, compiled in the investigation papers is referred to the Public Prosecutor if an offence is disclosed. A completed investigation is one that includes investigation of the defences that emerged from the investigation. This includes such gaps or weaknesses emerging from the statements of witnesses and of defences from the statement of the accused person. Such investigations may eliminate the gaps or weaknesses, and provide substance to be tested against defences when raised. This is important as it ensures that if charges are to be preferred, there are no gaps or weak links in the prosecution case in the way of a successful prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The role of the Public Prosecutor is quasi-judicial. It is to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> This quasi-judicial function is essential, because a decision to prosecute necessitates the accused to incur time and legal expense to defend himself, but for which there is no provision that he can recover costs if he is acquitted. For this reason, and to ensure there can be no doubt the decision was to prosecute and not persecute, there is the responsibility for the Public Prosecutor to be satisfied that there is an offence according to law and that the investigation papers contain proof beyond reasonable doubt. The notion of "if in doubt, prosecute and leave it to the court" is not only abandonment of that quasi-judicial function in the exercise of the absolute discretion to prosecute but also exposes prosecution to falling conviction rates. If the Public Prosecutor itself is in doubt, what court could conceivably find an accused, defended by counsel, guilty?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Ensuring that an innocent man does not run risk of being victimised or harassed by wrong exercise of powers of prosecution:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> If the accused pleads not guilty to the charges preferred against him, a trial is held. The purpose of the trial is to enable the trial court not only to see and hear the oral and/or documentary evidence relied upon by the prosecution and produced to the court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Ensuring that the courts do not run the risk of convicting and punishing an innocent person accused of an offence with taking away of his life, liberty and/or property:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> That there first must be an offence known to the law is underlined by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;121.;;">art 121(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> that "... the High Courts and inferior courts shall have such jurisdiction and powers as may be conferred by or under federal law." Unlike the courts of England in their common law jurisdiction, the courts in Malaysia cannot "recognise" a law as existing and to impose it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In a criminal trial, the facts constituting the ingredients of the offence as charged must be proved by admissible oral and/or exhibit evidence, produced and admitted into evidence before the court. See <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. And to convict requires that the facts be so proved to the standard of proof of "proved beyond reasonable doubt". The accused is given a fair opportunity to (a) test the evidence adduced, and (b) to lay out the foundation of his defence to relevant prosecution witnesses, and if called to enter upon his defence, to be heard in his defence. Laying out a defence to relevant prosecution witnesses not only (a) allows the defence to be tested by the prosecution, but also (b) gives notice to the prosecution and eliminates the defence from being labelled and dismissed as an afterthought, and may thereby accord the defence just enough credibility to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The burden of proof lies at all times upon the prosecution. It is firmly established that the evaluation is upon a maximum evaluation. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_701;"><i>Khoo Hi Chiang v.

    <p>
      <b>[18]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">Section 180 of the CPC</LINK> requires the prosecution to make out, upon a maximum evaluation, a <i>prima facie</i> case. Unless a prosecution witness recants upon his testimony or his credibility is destroyed, his testimony is taken into the consideration of whether a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out, even though his testimony was challenged in cross-examination by putting to him that his testimony or any identified part thereof was untrue, incorrect or contradicted by other evidence, oral and/or documentary. If the evaluation of his answers and how he answers that determine his credibility, which may result in there being a finding there remained a gap or a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, and which may be fatal to a conviction. Only if the court finds that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case is the accused called to enter upon his defence, where the accused is entitled to tender oral and/or exhibit evidence to provide substance to his defences and the questions put on his behalf to the prosecution witnesses. If sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt, he is entitled to be acquitted and discharged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Proof beyond reasonable doubt is therefore not driven by prejudices, emotions, feelings, outrage, demands or beliefs, but is necessarily and objectively grounded upon oral and/or exhibit evidence proving the facts constituting the offence as charged. At the end of the trial, a maximum evaluation is again conducted upon the whole of the oral and/or exhibit evidence, to consider whether the case for the defence succeeded to raise a reasonable doubt, and if so, the accused is entitled to an acquittal.</p>

      <b>The Appeal Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We reproduce below the main parts of the grounds of appeal set out by the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Issues</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned Deputy Public Prosecutor ably summed up the prolix and repetitive grounds of appeal and set out the issues as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We proceeded to address the issues as follows with the grounds of appeal in mind.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In this case, the victim, then below the age of 15 years, became pregnant and gave birth to a child on 5 February 2012 whose DNA proves conclusively that the appellant is the father. The appellant at the time of the alleged 1st offence was 56 years seven months. The DNA evidence that he is the father of the child of the victim then aged below 15 years provided compelling evidence that the appellant had committed the alleged rapes as charged and must be punished as provided by law. We used the term alleged rapes for it is a fundamental principle of the criminal law that a person is deemed innocent until proven guilty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Issue 3 concerned what the trial judge termed as a defence of alibi. The defence that the name of the appellant was not registered in the Register of the To-Day Hotel was, in our view, incorrectly termed in this case as a defence of alibi since the subject was brought up to contradict the prosecution case in the charges that the appellant took PW4 to the To-Day Hotel and that the alleged rapes occurred there, and not purely that the appellant could not have been the rapist as alleged because he was elsewhere.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The defence of alibi is about evidence that an accused was elsewhere at the time and occurrence of an alleged offence, and therefore notice must be given under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;402A.;;">s 402A of the CPC</LINK> to give opportunity to the Public Prosecutor to verify the evidence of witnesses listed in the notice of alibi as to whether the accused had raised a reasonable doubt as to where he was.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Since the High Court on appeal had accepted it was not a defence of alibi, the question now is whether the error on the part of the trial judge was material. In the light of the conclusive DNA evidence that the appellant was the father of PW4's child, whether the incidents of rape by the appellant against PW4 were in the To-Day Hotel or elsewhere pales in significance, as the primary issue is whether PW4's child is the product of the alleged rapes by the appellant. The date, time and place in a charge are to assist the accused in preparing his defence, but unless it is demonstrated an accused is prejudiced in the conduct of his defence, differences arising from approximations in dates, times and places are not, by themselves, so prejudicial as to render a conviction fatal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 1, Issue 2 And Issue 5</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Issue 1, Issue 2 and Issue 5 are intertwined.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Issue 1 and Issue 2 concern the finding of credibility of the victim XXX (PW4) that she was raped in the To-Day Hotel at No 40 Jalan Kpg Nyabor, when the register of the To-Day Hotel which the Inn-keeper is obliged by law to maintain, did not record the names of the appellant and PW4.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It was submitted for the appellant that an adverse presumption ought to be drawn for the failure to call the Inn-keeper to explain the absence of the names of the appellant and PW4 in the Register of the To-Day Hotel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Upon consideration of Issue 1, we observed that whether their names were recorded or not was the act of the Inn-keeper and not the appellant, and the Inn-keeper may have had reasons of his own. If he had reasons for the non-registration of the appellant's and PW4's names, then the fact that they were not registered does not mean they were not there. But the Inn-keeper was not called. Now, while if the Inn-keeper was called and the matter could be explained, the absence of evidence that the prosecution had the evidence of the Inn-keeper but chose to suppress it, renders the drawing of an adverse presumption to be a judicial discretion that is not judicially exercised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_292;"><i>Munusamy Vengadasalam v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 292</LINK>; [1987] 1 MLJ 492; [1987] CLJ 221, it was held by the Supreme Court that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Since an adverse inference can only be drawn if there is a withholding or suppression of evidence and not merely on account of failure to obtain evidence, find no error in not drawing an adverse inference. It was not shown from examination of other witnesses that such evidence was taken so that non-production can only be reasonably attributed to withholding or suppression. In the absence of an adverse presumption, the finding as to whether they were in the To-Day Hotel must necessarily be drawn from other evidence. In this case, it is that of the victim, PW4.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The learned trial judge had found PW4 to be a credible witness. The credibility of PW4 was an issue before the learned trial judge, who was required and therefore entitled to find PW4 credible or not and to accept or reject her testimony in whole or any part of it. The fact that in finding PW4 credible the learned trial judge did not appear to have considered certain facts that might have a bearing upon the finding, is immaterial where the certain facts do not have a determinative effect for a finding to the contrary. A finding of credibility is distinct from a finding of the accuracy of the testimony, and testimony may be accepted in one part yet not in another, since findings of fact are arrived at upon a maximum evaluation of all the evidence adduced and admitted into evidence before the court, be it at the prosecution stage or if the defence is called, at the end of the defence case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Since for the reasons we have given earlier above that the absence of the names of the appellant and PW4 in the To-Day hotel register do not have a determinative value as evidence as to whether they were or were not in the To- Day Hotel, the issue does not render the reasoning in the grounds of decision defective.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Issue 5 is as to corroboration of the testimony of PW4. It is not the law that testimony of a victim or minor must necessarily be corroborated in every material particular. Indeed a trial judge may convict upon uncorroborated testimony if the trial judge, having warned himself of the danger of convicting upon uncorroborated testimony, he was nevertheless satisfied it was safe to do so on the uncorroborated testimony: see for example <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1964_1_602;"><i>Chiu Nang Hong v.

    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The significance of the DNA evidence that the father of the child borne by PW4 cannot be under estimated. It provided conclusive evidence that the spermatozoa of the appellant fertilised the ova of PW4 within her. But as we have observed earlier above, the question is whether the fertilisation of PW4 ova by the appellant's spermatozoa was as a consequence of the alleged rapes as charged. This brings the matter to the incidents of alleged rapes we will address in Issue 4 and Issue 7 below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Issue 6</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Issue 6 pertains, if it is sustainable, to the validity of the trial proceedings in respect of the four charges.</p>

      <b>[38]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;164.;;">Section 164 of the CPC</LINK> provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The four offences the appellant was charged with are rapes. They are four offences of the same kind and within 12 months.

      <b>[42]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_4_41;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Ridzuan Kok Abdullah</i> [1995] 4 MLRH 41</LINK>; [1995] 2 MLJ 745; [1996] 2 CLJ 346, the High Court addressed the question of joinder of two charges for offences of trafficking under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39.;;">s 39B(1)(a)</LINK> and possession under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;6;;">s 6 of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK> alleged to be committed on 25 December 1992 at about 1.45am at No 5, Jalan Rantai 5, Taman Kobena, Tampoi, in the District of Johor Bahru. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;164.;;">Section 164 of the CPC</LINK> was not referred to as the offences were not of the same kind. The High Court applied the test in <i>Amrita Lal Hazra &amp; Ors v. Emperor</i> [1915] ILR 42 Cal 957, where four accused persons were charged with an offence under s 4(b) of Explosive Substances Act, Act VI of 1908, while all the six accused persons were charged with conspiracy under s 120B, Indian Penal Code. It was contended that a joint trial of all these persons for the two offences charged was illegal. In dismissing the contention, it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We found little assistance from <i>Amrita Lal Hazra &amp; Ors v. Emperor</i> which concerned four accused persons being tried together.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44] </b>We observed that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;164.;;">s 164</LINK> pertains to "offences of the same kind ... whether in respect of the same person or not ...", while <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;165.;;">s 165</LINK> pertains to "... one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more offences than one are committed by the same person ...", and both these are exceptions to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;163.;;">s 163</LINK> which ensures that an accused is in no doubt or confusion as to the particular offence for which he is charged and tried and must defend himself against. Though the alleged incidents in this case, regardless the incidents were in different months, involve the same accused, same victim, same offence and same place, they involve separate offences of rape. That the charges involve the same witnesses and evidence, and time and expense would be saved by a trial of the four charges together, find no merit in the light of the specific provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;164.;;">s 164</LINK> that only three offences of the same kind committed within the space of 12 months may be charged and tried together, and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;165.;;">s 165</LINK> that an accused may be charged and tried together for offences that arose from one series of acts committed by one person so connected together as to form the same transaction. We failed to see how four rapes, and over four separate months, can be seen as one transaction even if by the same accused upon the same victim and in the same place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> We observed also the reference in <i>PP v. Ridzuan Kok Abdullah (supra)</i> to <i>Babulal Chaukhani v. King Emperor</i> [1938] AIR PC 130 that the court must determine whether the acts were committed in the same transaction or not at the time the charge was framed and not at the end of trial. This is for the reason that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;163.;;">s 163 of the CPC</LINK> provides that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately, except in the cases mentioned in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;164.;;">ss 164</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;165.;;">165</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;166.;;">166</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;170.;;">170</LINK>.

    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The police case began with a Police Report SIBU/002281/12 made on 5 March 2012, by Rosmiati binti Abdullah (PW3), the mother of PW4:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The Police Report was made by PW3 one month after the birth of the child. PW4 told PW2, PW3 and PW13 that the rape occurred in August 2011. Later PW4 narrated three other incidents of rape to PW3 and PW13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The trial judge had at this point only set out the charges, described the number of witnesses, ingredients to be established, ruling at end of the prosecution case, calling the appellant to enter upon his defence, duty to consider whether prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, what reasonable doubt means, and said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> We reproduce the grounds of decision of the trial judge at some length in order that it is appreciated how the trial judge arrived at his decision. After summarising briefly the testimony of PW4, the grounds of decision continued as follows (at pp 368 to 379 of Rekod Rayuan Jilid 3):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We observed that having briefly summarised the testimony of PW4, the trial judge stated in the grounds of decision that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> From that the trial judge made the findings set out in para 29 of the grounds of decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We bore in mind that there were fundamentally two versions before the trial court: that of PW4 that she was raped on four occasions, and that of the appellant that there was no penile penetration and that penetration was only by PW4's fingers. As can be seen from the grounds of decision, the trial judge was satisfied as to the credibility of PW4 as a witness, that there was corroborative medical evidence, and having warned himself of convicting upon uncorroborated evidence he was ready to convict the appellant because the appellant had failed to rebut the case for the prosecution as to his guilt and based on the credible and consistent evidence of the victim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The grounds of decision, though replete with the legal terms and phrases, were somewhat disjointed and disconnected as to appear muddled or incoherent in its reasoning. We observed that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Reading the grounds of decision, it became evident the trial judge had found from the audio visual advantage of a trial judge that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>therefore did not consider the appellant's evidence to be of any value in determining whether the appellant had successfully cast any reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The case that comes to mind is <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. PP</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311 where it was held that even though a judge does not accept or believe the accused's explanation, the accused must not be convicted until the court is satisfied for sufficient reason that such explanation does not cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. The reasoning, confined to acceptance of credibility and warning as to danger of convicting without corroboration, fails the test in <i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v.

      <b>[59]</b> The impression as to demeanour from the audio-visual advantage is something not easily capable of being scrutinised directly not only on appeal, but such impression may be affected from any delay made in assessing and noting that demeanour. Hence, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;271.;;">s 271 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> provides for it to be noted at the end of the notes as to that witness's testimony. Without such a contemporaneous note at the end of the notes of a witness as to demeanour as a basis or reason, references to demeanour to support a decision suffers from the impression of likelihood it is more of an excuse to support the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In the circumstances, the finding as to credibility of PW4 based upon demeanour from the audio-visual advantage of the trial judge is flawed and unsafe.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In this case, Justina Lau Sie Wei (PW1), the Medical Officer in the Paediatric Department, testified the child was born at 34-35 weeks gestation. Dr Nurulhuda (PW8) reported it was about 32 weeks gestation. It has a direct bearing as to which incident in the four charges could have resulted in the conception. The appellant alleged penetration was not by penile but by fingers penetration. The possibility of conception by insemination by delivery of semen by fingers was put to PW1, a Medical Officer testifying for the first time. Her answer was she had not heard of any case report of fertilisation taking place other than by sexual intercourse. In her reply, she remarked pertinently that "... If it can be done so easily then we do not need artificial fertilisation." Given her experience her answer that she had not heard as such is not definitive as to whether it could happen. We took it she meant that fertilisation taking place other than by sexual intercourse needs to be done in a conducive environment at the specialised medical facilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> Dr Nurulhuda (PW8) testified in cross-examination:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In re-examination, PW8 testified:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> There was no other conclusion that the DPP accepted the prosecution witness's answer to the re-examination question Q8. Even if the public wisdom is that other than penile penetration and introduction of semen, fertilisation occurs only by medically supervised insemination, there was a confirmation by the prosecution's own expert witness, PW8, in a direct answer in re-examination and accepted by the DPP, that if a freshly ejaculated semen laden with spermatozoa is introduced to the vagina by the finger inserted conception could occur.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> Subsequent to this, no further evidence was adduced by the prosecution that PW8 was incorrect. We puzzled over these unusual testimony and what it means. Evidently, it means that even if fertilisation is even less likely to be successful by means of delivery of fresh semen by fingers compared to medically supervised insemination, it nevertheless was possible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> To determine whether a reasonable doubt was raised, we sought assistance from established caselaw authority. What constitutes a reasonable doubt in an objective evaluation is a precise concept. The Federal Court (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_589;"><i>State Public Service Commission, Sarawak v. Sarjit Singh Khaira</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 589</LINK>; [2000] 4 MLJ 353; [2000] 4 CLJ 245; [1999] 2 AMR 1394, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_28;"><i>Tan Boon Kean v.

Minister of Pensions</i> [1947] 2 All ER 372 where Denning J (as he then was), explained the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> We bear in mind PW8 confirmed in re-examination that fertilisation is possible by the delivery of fresh semen by fingers. At that point, although fertilisation by such means was confirmed possible by PW8, the delivery of fresh semen by fingers was purely a supposition or proposed explanation. If there was no testimony as to delivery by fingers, the ground would remain a supposition and we would have dismissed the appeal on the ground no reasonable doubt was raised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> But when the appellant testified as to fingers having been used to rub and introduce freshly ejaculated semen, possibility by such means in this case was no longer mere supposition, because there was evidence to be considered as to whether it raised a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Similarly, the version of the appellant when he testified, if on its own, without the confirmation of PW8 that fertilisation by such means was possible, would appear in our minds to be a supposition or proposed explanation, a fanciful possibility to deflect the course of justice. If there was nothing more, it would fail, and we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The appellant as DW1 testified that PW4 asked for sexual intercourse with him but though he touched her vagina, he did not have intercourse because her vagina was too small, that PW4 held his organ until he ejaculated. His hand or finger had semen after he ejaculated, and while he continued to touch her vagina she touched his semen, and they both inserted their fingers into her vagina.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> We examined the following cross-examination:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> In the light of the conclusiveness of the DNA that he was the biological father, we can only conclude that it was the answer of an ordinary person who did not expect that use of fingers could result in fertilisation and conception. The facts on the record is that matter came to PW3's attention only when the child was born. Even so, it was PW3 and not PW4 who lodged the Police Report, and that Police Report was made one month after the birth of the child. We concluded only it was the unexpected birth of the child that brought the matter to light. We dismissed from our minds any speculation as to what was going on.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Though the appellant's version appeared to be shifting blame to PW4, we do not think the comment is necessary. It distracts from the process of a maximum evaluation on an objective basis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> We remained guided by the Supreme Court in <i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor (supra)</i> where it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> Upon a maximum evaluation of the whole of the evidence before the court, the supposition that fertilisation occurred in this case by the introduction or delivery of semen by fingers, was no longer "but not in the least probable", but became a reasonable doubt because due to the testimony of PW8, there was the testimony of the appellant, properly having been laid out in cross-examination of the medical officers, that fingers had been so used. The confirmation by PW8 made the challenged but unshaken testimony of DW1 just is at the very least bit probable as to raise a reasonable doubt. The sole basis that gave rise to a reasonable doubt has nothing to do with belief in the version of DW1, but that PW8's testimony is that DW1's version was possible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> Reviewing the case as a whole, it was clearly a case that the defence of the appellant was put to the prosecution witnesses. The prosecution had notice of the defence. A material prosecution witness PW8 testified that fertilisation of ova by introduction of fresh semen by fingers was possible. No steps were taken to call a more experienced doctor to give evidence to explain away the testimony of PW8. There is no excuse on the record for not obtaining expert evidence that could be called to counter it. The court is left with one inference, that the prosecution accepted the confirmation by PW8 and the result must follow.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> Perhaps it is never too late to observe that since the burden at all times remains upon the prosecution to prove the offence as charged to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt, no charge should be filed for prosecution unless and until the prosecution is certain it could do so. There is after all no statute of limitation to crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> Finally, rape is even more of an outrage if it results in conception. Causing conception on a woman without her consent, or a minor who cannot consent, is an assault no less than rape resulting in conception. As we mentioned orally during submissions, steps ought to be taken quickly to add to the definition of rape.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> We did not think it is appropriate to consider convicting the appellant on lesser charges such as of indecent assault lest it lends the notion and the courts stand accused that the courts condone such lesser charges as sufficient charge and punishment, and detract from the urgency of introducing necessary legislation. No doubt the prosecution felt compelled to charge for rapes with no alternative charges for the very same reason that lesser charges are wholly inadequate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> For the reasons above, we allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court as varied as to the order of compensation upon appeal to the High Court.</p>
