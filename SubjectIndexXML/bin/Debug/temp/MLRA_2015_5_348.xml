    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was the sales' general manager with the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. There were no complaints about his work or performance until he received a show-cause letter from the Managing Director, alleging various breaches purportedly amounting to serious misconduct. The appellant replied to the show-cause letter explaining that he was not at fault, and he was not the decision maker in respect of certain decisions complained of, and he further stated that all related matters in respect of the show-cause letter could be resolved through discussions and dialogue. The 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent did not respond to the appellant's reply but immediately held an enquiry where the appellant was dismissed on five charges framed against him. The matter was referred to the Industrial Court which upheld the dismissal. The appellant applied for judicial review of the award to the High Court. The High Court affirmed the decision of the Industrial Court, and the appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The show-cause letter was not similar to the notice of domestic inquiry. The charges in the domestic inquiry were similar to the charges found in the Industrial Court. The Industrial Court was not clear in its finding on the charges. The Industrial Court said that the first and third charges were proven but at the end found the appellant guilty on the first and fourth charges. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Having scrutinised the show-cause letter, the appellant's reply to the showcause letter, the outcome of the charges in the domestic enquiry as well as the Industrial Court award, this court was of the view that the allegations, even if true, did not amount to misconduct and did not warrant dismissal with just cause and excuse. Some of the allegations, even if true, were stale and/or sterile allegations which could be said to have been engulfed by the doctrine of condonation. (para 28(i)-(ii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The Industrial Court had failed to first decide whether the complaint and/ or charges amounted to misconduct in law, before proceeding to find the appellant liable. Further, the Industrial Court failed to carry out a balancing exercise of the conduct of the parties and their respective responsibilities, taking into account the doctrine of condonation as well as the proportionality principle, consistent with the statutory requirement of justice, equity and good conscience anchored in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK>. In failing to do so the Industrial Court had failed to apply the law and legal principles and in consequence had committed a grave error of law which warranted that the decision be quashed. (para 28(iii))</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant (employee) appeals against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who refused to quash the award of the Industrial Court which dismissed the appellant's application against the dismissal by the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent (employer) based on just cause or excuse relating to allegations of misconduct. We heard the appeal on 13 November 2014 and upon hearing the submission, we allowed the appeal. My learned brothers Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA and Linton Albert JCA have read the judgment and agreed the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Misconduct And Industrial Jurisprudence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It must be strictly observed that industrial law jurisprudence does not permit all forms of unsatisfactory conduct or poor performance or negligence to be labeled as misconduct. There are a number of case laws here as well as in other recognised jurisdictions that explain what act or conduct amount to misconduct or will not satisfy the threshold.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> An industrial tribunal properly appraised of the facts must not succumb to any allegation of misconduct, if the acts complained of do not qualify as misconduct, or if the circumstances leading to allegation of misconduct do not warrant dismissal on the ground of just cause or excuse, taking into consideration the proportionality principle advocated in the case laws.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Industrial law jurisprudence does not permit any form of oppressive conduct on the part of an employer having the objective of dismissing the employee on "just cause or excuse" based on trivial allegations; based on matters that could have been dealt with appropriately with proper operating system or management system instead of taking drastic steps to dismiss the employee. The Industrial Court in the Malaysian context is obliged to do a balancing exercise taking into account such factors as the nature of the complaint the conduct of the employer, the operating and management system that is in place, the reason advanced by the employee as well as his conduct, and the gravity of the allegation; in order to ascertain whether the employee's act or omission qualifies as a misconduct to attract <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of Industrial Relations Act 1967 (IRA 1967)</LINK>. The proposition is fortified by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30 of IRA 1967</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It is now well established that in exercising the jurisdiction and power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the IRA 1967</LINK>, the duty of the Industrial Court is two-fold, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Failure to determine these issues on the merits would be a jurisdictional error which merits intervention by the High Court. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_23;"><i>Milan Auto Sdn Bhd v. Wong Seh Yen</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 23</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 537; [1995] 4 CLJ 449; [1996] 1 AMR 049].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The starting point and the key to decide whether the situation attracts <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20</LINK> is for the Industrial Court to determine whether the complaint qualifies as misconduct, taking into consideration all the circumstances and facts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The term 'misconduct' is not defined in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA 1967</LINK>. The <i>Law Lexicon</i> by P Ramantha Aiyar (Reprint 1992) defines misconduct <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In India there are some statutory guidelines as to what acts and omissions will be treated as misconduct. The learned author OP Malhotra, <i>The Law of Industrial Disputes</i> in 5<sup>th</sup> edn at pp 891 and 892 says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Some of the key words above are 'willful', 'habitual', 'riotous', frequent repetition', 'inciting others', etc; to show the gravity of the conduct. In the instant case, we note that none of the allegation by way of show cause letter or in the domestic inquiry or the charges framed in the Industrial Court attracts the key words or any criminal element including fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The Indian cases do not permit the employers to allege misconduct when the standing orders are silent and the courts do not leave it to the vagaries of the management to say ex post facto that a certain act exposes the workman to a penalty. [See <i>Glaxo Laboratories (I) Ltd v. The Presiding Officer, Labour Court</i> [1983] Lab IC 1909; OP Malhotra, 5 edn at p 892].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is well established that appellate courts will not interfere with finding of facts of the Industrial Court. This proposition is subject to the acid test employed in the decision of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_71;"><i>R Rama Chandran v. Industrial Court Of Malaysia &amp; Anor &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 1 MELR 71</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_725;">[1996] 1 MLRA 725</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 145; [1997] 1 CLJ 147; [1997] 1 AMR 433, which firmly established that the decision of the Industrial Court is susceptible to judicial review on the grounds of (i) illegality; (ii) irrationality; (iii) procedural impropriety; and (iv) possibly proportionality under which the courts are clothed with powers to scrutinise the decision not only for process but also for substance:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Decided cases after <i>Rama Chandran</i> had further clarified the legal position that where the facts do not support the conclusion arrived at by the Industrial Court or in arriving at its findings, or where the Industrial Court took into account irrelevant matters, or failed to take into account irrelevant matters, such findings are always amenable to judicial review. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2012_1_129;"><i>Ranjit Kaur S Gopal Singh v. Hotel Excelsior (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] 1 MELR 129</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_5_696;">[2010] 5 MLRA 696</LINK>; [2011] 1 ILJ 479; [2010] 6 MLJ 1; [2010] 4 ILR 475; [2010] 8 CLJ 629; [2011] 3 AMR 38].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The Federal Court in a recent decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2014_1_1;"><i>Norizan Bakar v. Panzana Enterprise Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 1 MELR 1</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_613;">[2013] 6 MLRA 613</LINK>; [2014] 1 ILJ 278; [2013] 6 MLJ 605; [2013] 4 ILR 477; [2013] 9 CLJ 409; [2013] 6 AMR 338, further affirmed that the doctrine of proportionality applies to cases under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;20.;;">s 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK>. The Federal Court referred to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;30.;;">s 30(5) and (6) as well as Item 5 of the Second Schedule</LINK> of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK> and held that the doctrine of proportionality of punishment is already inbuilt into the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It must also be noted that industrial law jurisprudence, under the doctrine of condonation, does not permit the employer to rely on stale and sterile charges based on past facts. The principle of condonation was lucidly explained by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_273;"><i>Public Services Commission Malaysia &amp; Anor v. Vickneswary Rm Santhivelu</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 273</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 1; [2008] 6 CLJ 573, where Zaki Tun Azmi PCA (as he then was) held as follows at p 284 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The appellant was a General Manager of sales with the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent (hereinafter shall be referred to as 'the respondent') company. He began his employment from 1 August 2002. There was no complaint about his work or performance until he received a show cause letter from the Managing Director, alleging various breaches purportedly amounting to serious misconduct. In evidence, the appellant alleged that the show cause was issued because he had a misunderstanding with the brother of the Managing Director. [See A/R pp 657 and 606]. It is also not in dispute that there were other officers of the company, including the Managing Director, who were directly or indirectly responsible and also liable to answer to the show cause letter per se. The terms of the appellant's letter of appointment also do not have any nexus to the show cause letter. The appellant did reply to the show cause letter explaining that he was <b>not at fault</b>, and <b>he was not the decision maker</b> and all related matters in respect of the show cause letter can be resolved through <b>discussion and dialogue</b> [Emphasis Added].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The respondent did not respond to the appellant's reply letter. The respondent immediately held an enquiry and dismissed the appellant on five charges framed against him. The reply to the show cause letter was part of the evidence but the Industrial Court did not consider his explanation in the letter <i>per se</i> but only considered his testimony.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The letter of appointment dated 30 July 2002 reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The show cause letter dated 8 May 2009 reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The reply to show cause letter reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The dismissal letter dated 2 July 2009 reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It must be noted that the show cause letter is not similar to the notice of domestic inquiry. The charges in the domestic inquiry was similar to the charges found in the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The Industrial Court was not clear in its finding on the charges. The Industrial Court said that the first and third charges were proven but at the end found the appellant guilty on the first and fourth charge. There is also much discrepancies on this as we note from the submission of the parties. It will be useful to repeat the Memorandum of Appeal for the purpose of confining the relevant issues to be dealt with. The said Memorandum of Appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The overall complaint of the appellant is that it was not a just cause or excuse as there was no misconduct on his part to warrant a drastic act of dismissal and it was also not a proportionate response by the employer. He also relies on the doctrine of condonation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The finding of the Industrial Court can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The finding of the learned High Court Judge can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We have read the Appeal Record and able submissions of the parties in detail. After much consideration to the submission of the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent, we take the view that the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> For reasons stated above, we allowed the appeal with costs of RM25,000.00 for here and below to the appellant. The decision of the High Court Judge and the award of the Industrial Court is set aside. Deposit is to be refunded. The case is to be remitted to the Industrial Court for compensation to be assessed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We hereby ordered so.</p>
