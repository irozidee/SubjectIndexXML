    <p>There were two appeals herein. The appellant in the first appeal was the Malaysian Palm Oil Board ('the 1st appellant') whilst the two appellants in the second appeal were the Minister of Plantation, Industries and Commodities ('the 2nd appellant') and the Government of Malaysia. The respondents in both appeals were owners of palm oil plantations who were imposed with the payment of cess under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2007_200;;">Malaysian Palm Oil Board (Cess)(Oil Palm Fruit) Order 2007 ('2007 Order')</LINK>. The 2007 Order was issued by the 2nd appellant pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board Act 1998 ('the 1998 Act')</LINK>. In the High Court action against the appellants, the respondents sought to declare the 2007 Order null and void and an order for the refund of the cess collected from them. The facts showed that the 2007 Order was issued to finance a Cooking Oil Subsidy Scheme to mitigate losses suffered by local millers and packers of cooking oil due to the rising prices of crude oil. The cess was imposed on owners of palm oil holdings not less than 40.46 hectares. The 2nd appellant pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;77.;;">s 77 of the 1998 Act</LINK> expressly exempted persons or classes of persons from the imposition of cess, namely, any Government land scheme of settlers or individuals and any palm oil smallholdings owned by individuals but managed and controlled by Government agencies. The exemption was also extended to palm oil owners holding less than 40.46 hectares, millers, refiners, packers, end-producers and the like. The learned judge, having found that the use of cess to subsidise the price of cooking oil was not one of the listed purposes under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the 1998 Act</LINK>, declared the 2007 Order invalid. The learned judge however did not order the refund of the cess collected on the ground that a separate application should be made by the respondents for that purpose. Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants' appeal, concurring with the learned judge that the collected cess was outside the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the 1998 Act</LINK> rendering it void and illegal. However, the Court of Appeal allowed the respondents' appeal, ordering the refund of the collected cess with interest. Hence, the present appeal by the appellants. Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law: (1) whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the 1998 Act</LINK> which empowered the 2nd appellant to impose cess via the 2007 Order was <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Federal Constitution ('the Constitution')</LINK>; and (2) whether the imposition of cess on a class of parties/ individuals under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the 1998 Act</LINK> and the exclusion of certain parties/ individuals from the same class was a form of discrimination and in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeals with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Parliament had clearly authorised the 2nd appellant to impose cess on the terms as set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the 1998 Act</LINK>. The cess collected under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1)</LINK> was a form of tax because <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(2) </LINK>expressly stated that the cess imposed was deemed a customs duty under the Customs Act 1967. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35;;">Section 35</LINK> was therefore a valid taxing statute. The components of tax law need not be specifically stated in the Act and could be made by way of an order as held by the Federal Court in Palm Oil Research And Development Board Malaysia &amp; Anor v. Premium Vegetable Oils Sdn Bhd. The 2007 Order issued by way of subsidiary legislation pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;355.;;">s 35 of the 1998 Act</LINK> was comprehensive enough to cover the tax law components. In the circumstances, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the 1998 Act</LINK> which empowered the 2nd appellant to impose cess via the 2007 Order was not <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK>. (paras 29-37)</p>
    <p>(2) The fact that the palm oil fruit producers were singled out for the imposition of the cess was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. Those who owned holdings that were more than 40.46 hectares were not in the same standing as those who owned less than 40.46 hectares. Discrimination would only arise if there were classification amongst owners holding 40.46 hectares of palm oil and more, where some were distinguished and one favoured over another. Further, the producers and packers were not similarly circumstanced as the respondents. They faced financial difficulties unlike the respondents. The cess was imposed to alleviate the financial problems faced by them. The dissimilarity in the circumstances was to achieve socio-economic aspects of the palm oil industry and hence was not a violation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK>. (paras 46-51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The documentary evidence clearly showed that estates owned by agencies linked to the Government, namely, FELCRA, FELDA, RISDA, SELCRA, TABUNG HAJI and KESEDAR did pay cess. The exemption was made only to the smallholdings managed by those agencies. That apart, the broad objectives and the stated functions of the 1st appellant as provided respectively in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;3.;;">ss 3(2)(a), (b)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">4(a) and (q) of the 1998 Act</LINK> showed that there were guidelines assisting the 1st and 2nd appellants in selecting or classifying persons for payment of cess. The collection of cess was to finance the subsidy on cooking oil to enable the ceiling price on the sale of cooking oil to local consumers to be maintained without adversely impacting the millers and packers. The 2007 Order did not offend <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK>. (paras 52-58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In construing the expressly listed purposes under an Act, the courts were not confined to undertaking a literal interpretation of the words therein but were permitted to construe the listed purposes in the context and scheme of the relevant Act as a whole. The 2nd appellant's power to impose cess for the purpose of subsidising the price of cooking oil must be viewed against the background, scheme and circumstances under which the 2007 Order was promulgated. <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;;">The 1998 Act</LINK> gave the 2nd appellant enough guidance in the use of his discretion to decide whether cess could be collected to subsidise the price of cooking oil. Given the wide scope of powers endowed upon the 1st and 2nd appellants, the power to impose cess for the purpose of subsidising the price of cooking oil was found to be inherent in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;;">the 1998 Act</LINK> itself. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">Section 35</LINK> could not be read in isolation from the rest of the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;;">the 1998 Act</LINK>. The payment of subsidy ran in tandem with Parliament's intention to reduce production costs on palm oil products. The objectives, role and functions of the 1st appellant must not be viewed in the narrow sense but viewed in the context of the industry inclusive of the interest and welfare of the consumer public. In the circumstances, the cess collected under the 2007 Order could be utilised to subsidise the price of cooking oil. The 2nd appellant had the authority to do so and it was well within the objectives, role and function of the 1st appellant as prescribed in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;;">the 1998 Act</LINK>.

      <b>Raus Sharif PCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> These two appeals concerned the constitutionality of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (Cess) (Oil Palm Fruit) Order 2007 (2007 Order), made by Minister of Plantation, Industries and Commodities pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board Act 1998</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The High Court struck down the 2007 Order as invalid. The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the High Court. The 2007 Order was declared invalid by the High Court on the ground as mentioned below in this judgment (see para 14) that the cess collected was used for purposes outside the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33</LINK>, thus rendering the 2007 Order void and illegal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellants (defendants) in these appeals are the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, the 1st appellant ("the Board"), the Minister of Plantation, Industries and Commodities, the 2nd appellant ("the Minister") and the Government of Malaysia, the 3rd appellant ("the Government").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondents are the oil palm owners who were subjected to the 2007 Order. They were the plaintiffs in the High Court and had instituted proceedings against the defendants to have the 2007 Order declared null and void, and an order for the refund of the cess collected from them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Leave to appeal was granted by this court to the appellants on two questions of law, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The background facts of this case which led to these appeals have been well set out in the judgments of the High Court (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_2_267;"><i>Arunamari Plantations Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Lembaga Minyak Sawit Malaysia &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 2 MLRH 267</LINK>; [2011] 1 MLJ 705; [2011] 2 CLJ 519) and the Court of Appeal (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_22;"><i>Arunamari Plantations Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors v. Lembaga Minyak Sawit Malaysia &amp; Ors And Other Appeals</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 22</LINK>; [2013] 1 CLJ 906). We will rely on them to a large extent and set them out in the following paragraphs in so far as they are relevant to the issues which arise for determination in these appeals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Sometime in early May 2007, the Government was informed about the losses suffered by the local millers and packers of cooking oil as a consequence of a combined effect of rising prices of crude oil and the ceiling price imposed by the Ministry of Domestic, Trade and Consumer Affairs on the sale of the cooking oil to local consumers. To mitigate the losses suffered by the millers and packers of cooking oil, the Government reactivated the Cooking Oil Subsidy Scheme (COSS). A similar scheme was successfully introduced in year 1999 and 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In order to finance the COSS, the Minister, after consultation with the Ministry of Finance, issued the 2007 Order. It was made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board Act 1998 ("the Act")</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[9]</b> The 2007 Order provided a levy and collection of cess by the Board from oil palm fruit producers who owned (a) oil palm holdings which is not less than 40.46 hectares or (b) oil palm holdings which is in aggregate amount to not less than 40.46 hectares. These oil palm fruit producers were required to pay the Board a cess for every metric tonne of oil fruit produced at the rate specified in the Schedule to the 2007 Order when the monthly average price of crude palm oil exceeds RM1,500 per metric tonne.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Under the same order, the Minister, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;77.;;">s 77 of the Act</LINK>, expressly exempted person or persons or classes of person from the imposition of cess. Such persons or classes of person were identified as (a) any Government land scheme with settlers or individuals participant, planted with oil palm or (b) any oil palm small holding owned by individual but managed and controlled by government agencies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Thus, Government related land schemes such as FELDA, FELCRA, RISDA, KESEDAR, LKPPP, SALCRA, LKTNS, Koperasi Sungai Manilan and Beliawanis were exempted from cess under the 2007 Order. The exemption from the 2007 Order was also extended to oil palm owners holding less than 40.46 hectares, the millers, refiners, packers, end-producers, end-product manufacturers, end-product retailers, suppliers and/or wholesalers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The 2007 Order was for a period from 1 July 2007 to 1 August 2008. During that period, cess was collected by the Board from oil palm plantation owners like the respondents who through this suit applied to have the 2007 Order struck out and the cess collected from them to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>[13] Before the High Court, the respondents mounted an attack on the Act and the 2007 Order on the grounds that it violated several parts of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution (Constitution)</LINK>. The respondents claimed, <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The trial judge decided in favour of the respondents on only one issue. The trial judge after acknowledging that Parliament had authorised the imposition of cess on terms set out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> was of the view that the cess collected could only be used for the purpose set out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the Act</LINK>. After examining <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33</LINK>, he opined that the use of cess to subsidise the price of cooking oil was not one of the purposes that cess collected could be utilised by the Board. For that reason alone the trial judge decided that the 2007 Order was <i>ultra vires</i> and consequently void and illegal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> On the other issues raised by the respondents, the trial judge held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The trial judge while holding that the collection of cess under the 2007 Order was void and illegal did not however order the refund of the cess collected. Instead, His Lordship was of the view that a separate application is to be made by the respondents for that purpose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Both parties appealed against the decision of the High Court. The respondents' appeal was over the failure of the High Court to order the refund of the cess paid and over the rejection of the other grounds advanced to challenge the impugned 2007 Order. The appellants' appeal was over the declaration that the 2007 Order was <i>ultra vires</i> the Act and thus invalid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was correct in holding the collected cess was used for purposes outside the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the Act</LINK> and thus the 2007 Order was <i>ultra vires</i> the Act and consequently was void and illegal. It further held that the 2007 Order was void and illegal for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Having found the above, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants' appeal. At the same time, the respondents' appeal was allowed, and the appellants were ordered to refund the respondents the cess collected with interest at the rate of 4%.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> As stated earlier, leave to appeal was granted by this court on two questions of law. We will first deal with the first question which reads:</p>
    <p>"Whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board Act 1998</LINK> which empowers the 2nd appellant to impose cess via subsidiary legislation is <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> For a better understanding of the issues involved, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK> are reproduced below :</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It is clear from the above that by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK> no tax can be imposed except by or under the authority of a federal law. The issue now is whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK>, a federal law which provides for the imposition of cess offends <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK>. In short, we are to determine whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> is a valid taxing statute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> As stated earlier, the Court of Appeal in finding that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> offended <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK> held <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the above findings of the Court of Appeal were contrary to the earlier decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_137;"><i>Palm Oil Research And Development Board Malaysia &amp; Anor v. Premium Vegetable Oils Sdn Bhd</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 137</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 97; [2004] 2 CLJ 265; [2004] 4 AMR 202 (Premium's case), an authority directly in point to the circumstances of these appeals. It was pointed out that this court in <i>Premium</i>'s case had dealt with the validity of a similar Cess Order issued by the Minister concerned, pursuant to the then equivalent <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the Palm Oil Research and Development Act 1979 ('the 1979 Act')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In Premium's case, one of the arguments advanced was that there was nothing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the 1979 Act</LINK> which can be construed as empowering the Minister to impose cess on palm oil millers. Thus, it is important that we examine <i>Premium</i>'s case in greater detail in regard to the approach undertaken by this court in dealing with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the 1979 Act</LINK> which was a precursor to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The facts of <i>Premium</i>'s case are these: The appellant was the Palm Oil Research and Development Board. The respondent was a company engaged in the extraction of crude palm oil ('CPO') from the whole palm fruits and crude palm kernel oil ('CPKO') from the kernel of oil palm fruits. By virtue of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;;">Palm Oil (Research Cess) Order 1979 ('the 1979 Order')</LINK> made under the authority of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;;">Palm Oil Research and Development Act 1979</LINK>, palm oil millers were required to pay cess for every metric ton of crude oil. The respondent did not dispute the imposition of cess on CPO but contended that the cess on CPKO was invalid. It took out an action in the High Court for a declaration that the appellant was not empowered to impose cess on CPKO and therefore sought a refund of the monies paid. The High Court found in favour of the appellant. On appeal by the respondent, the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's decision. This court then granted the appellant leave on the following questions: (1) Whether the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;;">Palm Oil Research and Development Act 1979</LINK>, is a taxing statute; (2) If the answer is in the affirmative, then what interpretation/ approach should be taken.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The main issue in <i>Premium</i>'s case was whether or not the 1979 Order which provided for the levying and collection of cess by the appellant from palm oil millers in respect of both CPO and CPKO, was <i>ultra vires</i> the parent statute, ie <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;;">the 1979 Act</LINK>. Three instances of <i>ultra vires</i> were raised by counsel for the respondent: (1) the absence of any authority in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;;">the 1979 Act</LINK>, in particular, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;2.;;">ss 2</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">14</LINK> thereof to collect cess from palm oil millers; (2) the levying of cess on CPKO was in itself <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;2.;;">ss 2</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">14 of the 1979 Act</LINK> because the definition of 'palm oil' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;2.;;">s 2</LINK> does not include 'kernel'; and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;2.;;">(3) the 1979</LINK> Order was an unauthorised enlargement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;2.;;">ss 2</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">14 of the 1979 Act</LINK> through the use of the expression 'and/or' in para 2 which purported to define a 'palm oil miller'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> This court held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the 1979 Act</LINK> to be a valid taxing statute. In addition, it also held that the specification concerning the persons to be taxed, the amount, and the manner of the collection of the tax by the Minister concerned in the said 1979 Order was valid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We adopt and apply the same reasoning in <i>Premium</i>'s case to the present case concerning whether s 35 of the Act is a valid taxing statute. In the present case, it is clear that Parliament has authorised the Minister to impose cess on the terms as set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35</LINK> and the sum collected for cess must be deposited into the fund to be managed by the Board and used only for the purposes set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the Act</LINK>. We have no doubt that the cess collected under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1)</LINK> is a form of tax. This is because <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(2)</LINK> expressly states that the cess imposed be deemed to be customs duty under the Customs Act 1967. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;160.;;">Article 160 of the Constitution</LINK> defines tax to include import or a duty but does not include a rate levied for local purposes or a fee for services rendered. Therefore, it cannot be denied that the cess statutorily imposed under<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;"> s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> is a duty which is a form of tax as defined by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We now revert to the finding of the Court of Appeal in that the tax law components have not been fulfilled in this case. In this regard, the Court of Appeal found that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1)</LINK> is equally silent on the person who is to be charged with tax and instead delegates the identity of the person to be subject to tax to the relevant Minister who by order is to specify "the person or class of persons on whom the cess is imposed". By this reason the Court of Appeal was of the considered view that the delegation of the selection of the persons to be charged with tax to the Minister effectively amounts to the identification of the person to be charged with tax to the Minister without the "authority of federal law", which is prohibited by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK>. The relevant part of the Court of Appeal's judgment on this point merits reproduction as shown below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> With respect we find that the understanding of the Court of Appeal that the components of tax law must be specifically stated in the Act does not accord with the view taken by the Federal Court in Premium's case. As stated earlier it is pertinent to note that the appellant in <i>Premium</i>'s case raised similar arguments with regard to the absence of the tax law components under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the 1979 Act</LINK>. But Steve LK Shim CJ (Sabah and Sarawak) after examining <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the 1979 Act</LINK> said that when the words "the order may specify the nature, the amount or rate and the manner of collection of the cess' were examined in their proper context <i>vis-a-vis</i> the provisions reflected in the 1979 Order, there can be no doubt that the Minister, in effecting the said 1979 Order, had complied with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the 1979 Act</LINK> as regards to the imposition of cess. Steve LK Shim CJ (Sabah and Sarawak) analysed the wordings that appeared in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14 of the 1979 Act</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> As can be inferred from the above paragraphs of the judgment of this court in Premium's case, the specification of the matters concerning the identity of the cess payer, the amount to be paid, the manner of collection can be made vide subsidiary legislation. This court had explicitly acknowledged that the three components of tax law need not be specified in the Act and can be made by way of an order. This court after referring to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14 of the 1979 Act</LINK> in particular the words 'and the orders may specify the nature, the amount and rate and the manner of collection of the cess' held that all the required particulars had been identified and specified under the 1979 Cess Order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In the present case, similar words were used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> as was used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;14.;;">s 14(1) of the 1979 Act</LINK>. In our judgment the wordings "orders may specify the nature, amount and rate of the cess, person or class of persons on whom the cess is imposed and the manner of collection" should be interpreted the same way as was done in Premium's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Thus, it is our finding that the Act had authorised the making of an order (in this case the 2007 Order) that may specify the nature, amount and rate of the cess, person or class of persons on whom the cess is imposed and the manner of collection of the cess thus fulfilling the three components of tax laws. It is not necessary that the classification must always appear on the face of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> itself. (see case of <i>Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice SR Tendolkar &amp; Ors </i>[1958] AIR SC 538).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> This court had made it abundantly clear in <i>Premium</i>'s case that the specification of those matters pertaining to the authority and power to impose and collect cess can be made by way of subsidiary legislation which had been delegated to the executive by federal law. That being said, the 2007 Order which was issued by way of subsidiary legislation pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35</LINK> of the Act is comprehensive enough to cover the tax law components. Paragraph 2 of the 2007 Order defines the producers of oil palm product are those who produce the "products" defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1979_218;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>. This would cover the class of persons on whom the cess is imposed. The manner of collection of cess is reflected in paras 4 and 5 and the rate of cess to be collected is specified under para 3 of the 2007 Order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In conclusion, based on the above reasons, it is clear that the Minister had complied with all of the legal requirements imposed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> and the 2007 Order made thereunder is found to be infallible and does not contravene <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK>. As stated earlier, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(2) of the Act</LINK> expressly stated that the cess imposed be deemed to be a customs duty. Therefore, we cannot deny that the cess statutorily imposed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> is a duty, which is a form of tax as defined under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In these circumstances, it is our finding that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> which empowers the 2nd appellant to impose cess via subsidiary legislation is not <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;96.;;">art 96 of the Constitution</LINK>. We shall accordingly answer the first question of law posed in this appeal in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We now turn to the second question of law posed in these appeals which read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The respondents in the present appeal alluded that the 2007 Order was a discriminatory tax law given the overwhelming evidence that the 2007 Order singled out only one category of persons to be subjected to tax out of others in a class similarly circumstanced. Further, the respondents argued that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1)</LINK> does not contain any basis or guidelines to assist the Minister and the Government in the matter of selection or classification of the persons to be subject to the payment of the cess.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> As stated earlier the Court of Appeal had accepted the respondents' contention and ruled that the singling out of the fruit producers only for the imposition of the cess was arbitrary and discriminatory and held that the 2007 Order was a piece of discriminatory law. The Court of Appeal was fortified in coming to this conclusion based on the fact that the powers conferred on the Minister without any policy guidelines in the Act, to determine the persons to be subject to tax are so wide yet, so as to render the delegation to be arbitrary and uncontrollable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In deciding it as it did the Court of Appeal referred to the decision of this court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_20;"><i>Danaharta Urus Sdn Bhd v. Kekatong Sdn Bhd</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 20</LINK>; [2004] 2 MLJ 257; [2004] 1 CLJ 701; [2004] 6 AMR 429 which made reference to the test of reasonable classification propounded by the Indian Supreme Court in <i>Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia &amp; Ors v. Shri Justice Tendolkar SR &amp; Ors (supra)</i>. This test, divided into five categories, were said to be:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The Court of Appeal relied on categories (c) and (e) as postulated in the case of Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia in coming to its conclusion that the 2007 Order is a piece of discriminatory law and that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;77.;;">s 77 of the Act</LINK> is <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> It is given that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK> guarantees that all persons are equal before the law and entitled for equal protection of the law. The jurisprudence relating to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK> has been aptly discussed and summarised in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1976_1_364;"><i>Datuk Haji Harun Bin Haji Idris v. PP</i> [1976] 1 MLRA 364</LINK>; [1977] 2 MLJ 155. In that case one of the issues raised was that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;418.;;">s 418 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> (under the provisions of which the case was transferred from the subordinate court to the High Court for trial) was inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK> and therefore void by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4</LINK>. Suffian LP, in dealing with the issue, had laid down the principles of equality in the Malaysian context in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The jurisprudence relating to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK> was further propounded in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1986_1_272;"><i>Malaysian Bar &amp; Anor v. Government Of Malaysia</i> [1986] 1 MLRA 272</LINK>; [1987] 2 MLJ 165; [1987] CLJ 185. There, Salleh Abas LP in his dissenting judgment stated as follows at pp 279-280:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> We respectfully share the views stated above. Thus, we find that the Court of Appeal had misconstrued the respondents' complaint in addressing this point that the singling out of the fruit producers only for the imposition of the cess was arbitrary and discriminatory. To this extent, we had to consider whether the classification was reasonable or permissible. Having deliberated on this issue, our conclusion is that the 2007 Order is not discriminatory. We are of the view that equality before the law guaranteed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8</LINK> does not mean that all laws must be general in character and universal in application. The legislature may make laws in respect of a group or a class of persons provided that the grouping or classification is rational; founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons that are grouped together from others that are left out of the group; there must be a policy or object sought to be achieved by that Act and there must be a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> That being the position, we could not see the basis of the respondents' contention that the singling out of the fruit producers only for the imposition of the cess was arbitrary and discriminatory. In our judgment those oil palm fruit producers who own holdings more than 40.46 hectares are definitely not in the same standing with those who owned less than 40.46 hectares. To put it simply, discrimination would only arise if there is a classification amongst owners holding more than 40.46 hectares of palm oil that is distinguishing some and favouring one over another. The decision to impose the cess on the private estates cannot be said to be unreasonable and discriminatory. Surely policy consideration would reflect that private estates would have higher bargaining power than smaller ones <i>vis-a-vis</i> the private estate run at a larger scale would have a higher bargaining power than the smaller estate owned by public institutions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In this regard, we also find that the Court of Appeal had missed an important point in that it would have been otherwise had the cess been imposed only on the respondents and not other private estates. This was certainly not the case here. Further we agree with the appellants in that it cannot be said that it was not imposed on others (in the same category as the respondents) who are similarly circumstanced, such as the producers and packers, because in reality they are not similarly circumstanced. We say this because the producers and the packers are the ones who are facing the financial difficulties, not the growers like the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The purpose of imposing cess on the private estates was to alleviate the financial problems faced by the producers and packers of cooking oil by reason of the increase in the cost of crude price oil, resulting in the increase of the price of cooking oil. The cess collected was to be utilised to compensate the losses incurred by the producers and packers of cooking oil for the months of January to May 2008 by reason of the said increase in the price of crude price oil and to stabilise the price of cooking oil.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Thus, we agree with the submission of the appellants on this point that it was for this reason that the Minister and the Minister of Finance acting under the authority given by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> and in the exercise of their discretion, decided to issue the 2007 Order to stabilise the price of cooking oil by way of subsidy through the imposition of the cess on the private estates. To say that the exercise of the discretion by the Minister to impose the cess only on the private estates is unreasonable and arbitrary is akin to ignoring the background of the objective, policy and functions of the Board and the situation warranting the imposition of the cess.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We therefore analyse the present appeal in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> On the basis of the aforesaid analysis we hold that the dissimilarity in these circumstances is not essentially arbitrary but to achieve the socio-economic aspects of the oil palm industry, and thus is not a violation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Now, the respondents' other complaint was that cess was imposed only on private estates and not on government linked estates, exempted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;77.;;">s 77</LINK>, and others involved in the production of oil palm products. The appellants' refuted this contention based on the documentary evidence adduced by them pursuant to the appellants' application to adduce fresh evidence. The appellants' endeavoured to highlight that the Government-linked estates did pay the cess, with only the smallholdings being exempted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> We are inclined to agree with the appellants' contention on this point. The documentary evidence adduced vide the appellants' application to adduce fresh evidence clearly show that estates owned by agencies linked to Government such as FELCRA, FELDA, RISDA, SELCRA, TABUNG HAJI, KESEDAR did pay the cess. At this juncture it is sufficient for our present purpose to state that the facts disclosed in the documentary evidence accord sufficient support to the fact that the exemption was only given to holdings owned by smallholders or smallholdings managed by these agencies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> As for the respondents' second complaint, ie <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1)</LINK> does not contain any basis or guidelines to assist the Board and the Minister in the matter of selection or classification of the persons to be subject to the payment of the cess, we are of the considered view that the guidelines for the exercise of the discretion by the Minister in making the Cess Order pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> can be ascertained from the objective, policy and functions of the Board. The policy guidelines for the exercise of the discretion by the Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> when he issued the 2007 Order can be easily ascertained when one scrutinises <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;3.;;">s 3(2)(a), (b)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">s 4(a) and (q)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55] <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;3.;;">Section 3(2)(a)</LINK> clearly lays down that the objectives of the Board are to promote and develop the oil palm industry of Malaysia; and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;3.;;">s 3(2)(b)</LINK> to develop national objectives, policies and priorities for the orderly development and administration of the oil palm industry of Malaysia. This is further fortified by the functions of the Board as stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">s 4(a)</LINK>, ie to implement policies and developmental programmes to ensure the viability of the oil palm industry of Malaysia and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">s 4(q)</LINK> to do such other things as it deems fit to enable it to perform its functions effectively or which are incidental to the performance of its functions."</b> [Emphasis Ours]</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The broad objectives of the Board as stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;3.;;">s 3(2)(a) and (b)</LINK> and the stated functions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">s 4(a) and (q)</LINK>, all envisage the role and function of the Board in ensuring the viability and sustainability of the oil palm industry in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The basis of classification of the party who is liable to pay the cess had been clearly explained in the 2007 Order. In this regard we find that the classification made was in accord with the objectives, role and function of the Board as prescribed in the Act and was not unguided or uncontrolled as found by the Court of Appeal. In our judgment we find that there is a basis for the classification which is founded on an intelligible differentia which has a reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by it, for a definite matter of public importance, ie the collection of cess was nothing more but to finance the subsidy on 60,000 tons of cooking oil per month, to enable the ceiling price on the sale of cooking oil to local consumers to be maintained without adversely impacting the millers and packers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Our careful perusal concludes that the 2007 Order does not offend <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">art 8 of the Constitution</LINK>. Having ruled so, we would answer the second question of law posed in these appeals in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Having decided on the two questions of law posed to us, we were also called upon to rule on the finding of the High Court which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal on the issue that the cess collected could not be used to subsidise the price of cooking oil. As stated earlier, after acknowledging that Parliament had authorised the imposition of cess on terms set out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK>, the High Court held that the cess collected could only be used for the purpose set out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the Act</LINK>. After examining <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33</LINK>, the learned trial judge opined that the use of cess to subsidise the price of cooking oil was not one of the purposes that cess collected could be utilised by the Board. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the trial judge as well as the Court of Appeal were right in declaring that subsidising the price of cooking oil was not one of the purposes that monies from the fund managed by the Board pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the Act</LINK> could be used. The respondents' position is that, there were no provisions that enable the Board to expend the Fund outside the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33 of the Act</LINK>. To this end learned counsel had placed reliance on the case of <i>Bromley London Borough Council v. Greater London Council</i> [1982] 2 WLR 62 and <i>Prescott v. Birmingham Corporation</i> [1954] 3 WLR 990 in support of their argument. Reference was also made to the cases of <i>Bimal Chandra Ranerjee v. State Of Madhya Pradesh</i> [1971] AIR SC 517 and <i>WT Ramsay Ltd v. Inland Revenue Commission</i> [1982] AC 300. These cases were also relied upon by the Court of Appeal in concluding that there must be statutory authorisation for the collection and utilisation of the cess for subsidising the price of cooking oil.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The Court of Appeal in relying on the decisions in <i>Bimal Chandra Ranerjee</i> and <i>Ramsay</i> held at para 20 of the grounds of judgment that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> With respect, we find that the Court of Appeal had misdirected itself in coming to the above finding. In this respect, we share the view of Lord Wilberforce in <i>WT Ramsay Ltd v. Inland Revenue Commission (supra)</i>, in that courts in construing the expressly listed purposes is not confined to undertaking a literal interpretation of the words therein but permitted to construe the listed purposes in the context and scheme of the relevant Act as a whole. In our judgment we find that the Court of Appeal in giving <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33(d)</LINK> a narrow and restricted interpretation had failed to appreciate the extent of the objective and purpose of the Act and the role and function of the Board in the context of the wider interest and impact in the palm oil industry in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> We are of the view that in construing a taxing statute, the function of the court is to discover the true intention of the Parliament. In that process, the court is under a duty to adopt an approach that produces neither injustice nor absurdity. In other words an approach that promotes the purpose or object underlying the particular statute albeit that such purpose or object is not expressly set out therein. This sentiment was echoed by this court in Premium's case. Steve LK Shim CJ (Sabah &amp; Sarawak) had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In his concurring judgment His Lordship Haidar FCJ (as he then was) also took a similar view in stating that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> We are also of the similar view that in considering the proper statutory construction of a taxing statute, one which would promote the purpose of the Act in question must be adopted. In our judgment the Minister's power to impose cess as was done in this case for the purpose of subsidising the price of cooking oil must be viewed against the background, scheme and circumstances under which the 2007 Order was promulgated. In this regard we find that the Act has given the Minister enough guidance in the use of his discretion to decide whether cess can be collected to subsidise the price of cooking oil.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> To illustrate the above point, we wish to highlight here that under the Act, the Minister is empowered to appoint members of the Board; the power to give general directions where the Board shall be responsible to the Minister as stipulated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;15.;;">s 15(1) and (2) of the Act</LINK>; to determine the contribution to such organisations related to the oil palm industry (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33(d)</LINK>); to approve making contributions to any organisation whether within or outside Malaysia for the purpose of promoting the marketing of oil palm products (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;33.;;">s 33(i)</LINK>); to make order for the imposition, variation or cancellation of cess on oil palm products after consultation with the Minister of Finance (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK>); to approve borrowing money and investment by the Board (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;38.;;">ss 38</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;39.;;">39</LINK>); to exempt any person or class of persons or any oil palm product from all or any of the provisions of the Act and may impose any terms and conditions as he thinks fit on any exemption (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;77.;;">s 77(1) and (2))</LINK>; and to make regulations for all or any of the purposes listed in the Act as stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;78.;;">s 78(1)(a)-(n) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The Board's objectives are based on the nature of the primary commodity, on which the Board is responsible. This is stipulated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;3.;;">s 3(2) of the Act</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The functions and powers of the Board are stated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">s 4(a)-(q)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;5.;;">s 5(a)-(j)</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> As can be seen from the above, the Board is a statutory body which not only regulates oil palm industry including its end product, palm oil, as defined, it also functions as the promoter, marketing and distributer of palm oil. A closer scrutiny of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">s 4</LINK> would connote that the Board plays a pivotal role in implementing policies and development. The rationale for imposition of the cess for stabilising the price of cooking oil can be inferred from the broad array of Ministerial powers and powers of the Board as prescribed by the Act which we have discussed above. Thus, we have no hesitation to hold that the 2007 Order issued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> for the purposes of subsidising the cooking oil is valid. Given the wide scope of powers endowed upon the Minister and the Board, <i>prima facie</i> it can be concluded that the power to impose cess for the purpose subsidising price of cooking oil is found to be inherent in the Act itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> In this regard we should stress here that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;35.;;">s 35 of the Act</LINK> cannot be read in isolation from the rest of the provisions of the Act to understand the purpose behind the imposition of cess on oil palm product to stabilise the price of cooking oil. This has been elucidated earlier but deserves to be reiterated. As stated earlier one of Board's functions is to regulate and promote all activities relating to, planting, supply, sale, purchase, distribution, movement, storage and also the powers to undertake and coordinate such activities as it deems necessary for the purpose of protecting and furthering the interests of the oil palm industry of Malaysia, following <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;4.;;">s 4(d)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1998_582;5.;;">s 5(g) of the Act</LINK> as stated above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> Our careful examination in interpreting the whole of the Act finds that the Board is not only to regulate but also to promote all activities in the oil palm industry. Therefore we find that the payment of subsidy to reduce the production costs suffered by the millers and packers as decided in the Board runs in tandem with Parliament's intention to reduce production costs in the upstream activity as well as to continually improve the output on palm oil products. We agree with the submission advanced by the appellants in that when one speaks of the objectives, role and functions of the Board, one cannot view them in the narrow sense but must be viewed in the context of the industry, inclusive of the interest and welfare of the consumer public. Collection of cess for subsidising the price of cooking oil as was done in this case was to alleviate the losses suffered by the millers and packers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> In these circumstances we find that the cess collected under the Cess Order 2007 can be utilised to subsidise the price of cooking oil. We are of the view that the Minister had the authority to stabilise the price of cooking oil resulting from the increase of the price of the Crude Palm Oil through imposition of the cess which was well within the objectives, role and function of the Board as prescribed in the Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> To sum up, our findings based on the issues canvassed and argued before us are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For the aforesaid reasons we allow the appellants' appeals with costs. The orders of the courts below are hereby set aside.</p>
