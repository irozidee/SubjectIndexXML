    <p>The High Court had allowed the appellant's claim against the respondent, the 2nd defendant at the High Court, as an assignee of certain debts due and payable to one Benatulin Sdn Bhd ('Benatulin'). Benatulin, the 1st defendant at the High Court, was the respondent's supplier of printing papers. The High Court entered judgment in favour of the appellant against the respondent for the sum of RM6,206,547.62 and RM584,000 with interests and costs. The appellant had also obtained judgment in default against Benatulin for the sum of RM2,235,768.58. The respondent had appealed to the Court of Appeal against the High Court decision and the Court of Appeal had allowed the appeal, as a result of which, the appellant appealed herein. The respondent had awarded three contracts to Benatulin for the supply of paper and cardboard, two of which were contracted in 1996 ('the 1996 contracts') and the third contracted in 1997 ('the 1997 contract'). Benatulin sought a financing facility from the appellant to honour its supply obligations, and as security, Benatulin assigned all payments due to it by the respondent to the appellant. However, it was a term of the contract that no assignments could be made without the prior written consent of the respondent. The problem between the parties arose when the respondent issued purchase orders to Benatulin after the expiry of the 1996 contracts. The appellant claimed that the respondent failed to make any payment to the appellant for those purchase orders despite endorsements on the invoices that payments were to be continued to the appellant. The respondent in defence claimed that the purchase orders post the 1996 contracts were made pursuant to the 1997 contract and that Benatulin had obtained the respondent's consent in writing that payments henceforth were to be paid to one Consolidated Forest Products Sdn Bhd ('CFP'). As such, the respondent made the payments to CFP under the 1997 contract. The respondent claimed that it would be wrong and unjust for it to pay again for the same purchases. The question in this appeal was whether the consent of the debtor was a legal requirement for the assignment to be valid in law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) Civil Law Act 1956 ('CLA')</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The restriction on the assignment of the contractual rights and benefits in both the contracts spelt out in no uncertain terms that Benatulin could not assign or transfer any part of the contract, any monies and benefits under the contract without the prior written consent of the respondent. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The non-assignment clauses expressly laid down that consent was a condition precedent before an assignment could be made. The insertion of the non-assignment clauses as a term of the contract was not in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) CLA</LINK>. The non-assignment clauses which made consent a precondition before the debts could be assigned did not operate to invalidate the assignment contract as they were terms agreed upon by both parties when they entered into the contracts. Parties were free to enter into a contract with terms and conditions as they deemed fit and those terms and conditions were binding on the parties who had in the first place agreed to be bound by them. Therefore, there could not be a valid assignment if the element of consent under the non-assignment clause was not fulfilled. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> As the element of consent was a prerequisite before a valid assignment could be made, the requirements under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) CLA</LINK> with regard to a legal assignment only came into play if the contract was assignable or the restriction to assign was fulfilled. In the present case, the non-assignment clauses and the element of consent thereunder formed an important term of the contract that the parties had agreed to. That formed the main prerequisite before the other prerequisites under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3)</LINK> could be considered. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was no evidence to show that the respondent consented to the assignment of Benatulin's rights to the appellant under the 1997 contract. The language used in the letters concerned did not support the appellant's submissions that the respondent had acknowledged that the purchases made were an extension of the 1996 contract. It was an implied term of the contract that there could be no assignment by Benatulin of its rights under the 1997 contract unless the prior written consent of the respondent was obtained. An attempted assignment of contractual rights in breach of a contractual prohibition was ineffective to vest the contractual rights in the appellant. (paras 38-41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The appellant's claim was based on the purported assignment P2 dated and stamped on 22 April 1998 although notice of such an assignment was purportedly given to the respondent as early as 23 August 1996. The point of critical importance was not whether notice of assignment was given to the respondent but whether Benatulin had obtained the respondent's consent in writing before executing the assignment with the appellant. As Benatulin failed to secure the respondent's consent, the respondent was therefore not bound to honour the appellant's request and had rightfully refused to recognise the instruction by Benatulin to divert payments to the appellant. The purported assignment lacking the respondent's consent for the purchases made were unenforceable against the respondent. It followed that the purported assignment by Benatulin to the appellant without the consent of the respondent breached the 1997 contract. The appellant's claim as an assignee must therefore fail. Further, the appellant's claim against the respondent could not be allowed as the respondent had already made payments for the purchases to Benatulin and CFP. (paras 42-43)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Raus Sharif PCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 28 March 2013 which allowed the 2nd defendant's appeal against the decision of the High Court with costs. At the High Court the plaintiff, Merita Merchant Bank Singapore Ltd (Merita) sued the 2nd defendant, Dewan Bahasa Dan Pustaka (DBP) as an assignee of certain debts due and payable by DBP to the 1st defendant, Benatulin Timur Sdn Bhd (Benatulin) who had supplied printing papers to DBP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 6 April 2010, the learned High Court Judge after a full trial allowed Merita's claim against DBP and entered judgment in the sum of RM6,206,547.62 and RM584,000.00 with interest and costs. Earlier, Merita had, on 14 August 2008 obtained a judgment in default against Benatulin for the sum of RM2,235,768.58.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 21 November 2013, this court granted Merita leave to appeal on a sole question of law which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In 1996-1997, DBP awarded three contracts to Benatulin for the supply of paper and cardboard to DBP, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In order to honor its supply obligations to DBP, Benatulin sought a financing facility from Merita, and as security, Benatulin assigned all payments due to it by DBP to Merita.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The contracts between DBP and Benatulin expressly provided under cl 24 in the 1996 Contracts and cl 23 in the 1997 Contract that no assignment could be made without the prior written consent of DBP. Clause 24 and cl 23 which were similarly worded expressly provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In the context of the above contracts the words "Dewan" referred to DBP and "Kontraktor" referred to Benatulin. From the above clause, it could be surmised that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Under the 1996 Contracts, Benatulin had obtained a written consent from DBP (exh P3 and D24 for Tender 3/96 and exh P4 for Tender 7/96) for the payment due to it to be assigned to Merita. Pursuant to the consent obtained, all monies due under the 1996 Contracts were paid by DBP to Merita.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> All was well between the parties until 1998, when Merita filed a civil suit against Benatulin and DBP to claim for payments for purchases made after the 1996 Contracts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It is not in dispute that after the expiry of the 1996 Contracts DBP issued purchase orders to Benatulin vide the following Letters:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It is Merita's case that pursuant to the said letters, papers were supplied by Benatulin to DBP and invoices were issued thereunder with express endorsement for the cheques to be made payable to Merita. However despite the endorsements in the said invoices DBP had failed to make any payment to Merita. It is Merita's case that the aforesaid purchases vide the said letters were an extension to Tender 3/96 of the 1996 Contracts. Merita took the position that at all times, DBP treated the purchases post the 1996 Contracts as nothing more than continuing purchases under the 1996 Contracts. In these circumstances, Merita claimed that DBP was obliged to make all payments due for the orders made under the said letters to Merita.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In supporting its claim Merita relied on DBP's letter dated 2 June 1997 (P7) wherein DBP confirmed that Benatulin's re-appointment as a supplier for the year 1997 was an extension of Tender 3/96 of the 1996 Contracts. Further Merita relied on the undated assignment (P2) stamped on 22 April 1998 which was executed between Benatulin and Merita wherein all of Benatulin's rights under the Contracts executed between DBP and Benatulin were to be assigned to Merita. Thus, it was contended that the assignment (P2) was an absolute assignment wherein it expressly stated that Benatulin agreed to and has irrevocably and unconditionally assigned, transferred and set-over to Merita all its rights, title and interest of all contracts entered between DBP and Benatulin.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In its defence DBP maintained that the purchases made vide the said letters after the 1996 Contracts were made pursuant to the 1997 Contract. As we have said earlier, in the 1997 Contract which was executed between DBP and Benatulin on the 3 September 1997, there was a similar restriction for subcontract and assignment as was provided under cl 24 of the 1996 Contracts. The said restriction was laid down under cl 23 of the 1997 Contract wherein it was a precondition that Bentatulin must get the written consent from DBP before any assignment of Benatulin's rights and benefits under the contract could be made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It is DBP's case that for the 1997 Contract, Benatulin had applied for and obtained the consent in writing of DBP for payments due to be paid to one Consolidated Forest Products Sdn Bhd (CFP). The written consent of DBP was given by a letter dated 10 October 1997 (P41). In accordance with the consent given, DBP was to pay the monies to CFP until notified otherwise. It is DBP's case that payments were made to CFP under the 1997 Contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In respect of the assignment executed by Benatulin, it is DBP's case that it never consented to it. Thus, it is DBP's case that the payments for the 1997 Contract was made to CFP for which Benatulin had applied for and obtained DBP's consent. It would therefore be wrong and unjust for DBP to pay again for the same purchases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned trial judge after a full trial allowed Merita's claim against DBP. The learned trial judge held that the supply made by Benatulin based on the said letters was an extension of the 1996 Contracts under Tender 3/96. The learned trial judge also held that the assignment at exh P2 was an absolute assignment; and, was not limited to any particular contract. It covered all supplies under the said letter which was binding on Merita, Benatulin and DBP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The Court of Appeal allowed DBP's appeal and set aside the learned trial judge's orders. Essentially the Court of Appeal held that the learned trial judge erred when she overlooked the undisputed fact that the assignment itself did not bear the assent of DBP. DBP was not a party to it. The Court of Appeal found that although Tender 3/96 was mentioned in the said letters which Merita had predicated its claim, it did not necessarily make DBP a party to the assignment in P2 between Benatulin and Merita. The fact that the purported assignment was not dated and was only stamped about a month after the writ was filed supports the conclusion that no copy of the undated assignment was served on DBP and was kept by Merita. As for the two notices of the assignment given by Merita to DBP, the Court of Appeal held that the notices in their plain and literal meaning only gave notice of the payments due under the respective contracts. The language used in the notices did not reflect the express language used in the undated assignment, ie that it was an assignment of payment for all the respective contracts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Before us learned counsel for Merita submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956 (CLA)</LINK> provided that a legal assignment is valid once the assignment is made in writing and notice of the same had been given to the debtor. As such learned counsel highlighted that there is no necessity for the assignor to obtain the consent of the debtor before a legal assignment can be made. Based on the facts, learned counsel argued that a proper notice of assignment in writing had been given by Merita to DBP and that fulfilled the requirement for a valid and binding assignment to take effect under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK>. Learned counsel further submitted that since consent is not a prerequisite for an assignment to be valid and binding on the parties, the non-assignment clauses which appeared in the 1996 Contracts and the 1997 Contract as in this case was in effect a contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> DBP took the position that the element of consent is a pre-requisite before any legal assignment of the benefits under the 1996 Contracts and 1997 Contract, could be assigned. This was clearly stipulated under the non-assignment clauses as appears in cl 24 of the 1996 Contracts and cl 23 of the 1997 Contract that Benatulin could not assign any part of the contract, any monies under the contract and any of the benefits under the contract without the consent of DBP. Since Benatulin failed to obtain consent for the assignment of the benefits for the purchases made under the said letters, ie the 1997 Contract which Merita had based its claim on, any purported assignment as between Benatulin and Merita was unenforceable against DBP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Thus, the issue for us to determine is whether consent of the debtor is a legal requirement in order for an assignment to be valid in law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK>. In this case, it is not in dispute that there was a restriction imposed against Benatulin to subcontract or assign their rights under the two contracts, ie the 1996 Contracts and 1997 Contract vide cl 24 and cl 23 for which both DBP and Benatulin agreed to be bound. The restriction on the assignment of the contractual rights and benefits in both the contracts spelt out in no uncertain terms that Benatulin could not assign or transfer any part of the contract, any monies and benefits under the contract without the prior written consent of DBP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We agree with the submission of Merita on this point in that consent of the debtor is not a precondition under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">Section 4(3) of the CLA</LINK> provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The pivotal issue here is however whether one party to a contract can unilaterally proceed to assign the rights and benefits under the contract despite having agreed to be bound mutually by a non-assignment clause which clearly stipulated that consent was a precondition before a valid assignment could be effected? This brings into focus another issue, ie whether consent under a non-assignment clause is a precondition before an assignment can be valid notwithstanding the fact that this is not clearly spelt out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK>. Against the backdrop of these issues, we are to determine whether the non-assignment clauses and the requirement for consent as incorporated in the 1996 Contracts and the 1997 Contract in the present case are valid in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Perhaps it would be opportune for us first to deal on the concept of non-assignment clauses and what it entails as a legal mechanism of some consequence. In practice, non-assignment clauses are very common in modern commercial contracts, often drafted for the benefit of both parties. Prohibitions on assignment derive from a concern that the debtor should not be required to perform the contract for anyone other than the party to the contract. This is their commercial objective. Further the non-assignment clause is subject to terms as agreed between the parties. As such that term must be binding on both of the parties. The effect of the prohibition depends on the construction of the prohibition clause in the contract. The prohibition may not be absolute, for example, a term that one party is not to assign the contract without the consent of the other. "If a contract contains a term prohibiting assignment, any purported assignment in breach of that prohibition made by one party of his contractual rights or of his rights arising under the contract will be ineffective as against the other party to the contract. It may however create rights between the assignor and assignee". [See <i>Law of Assignment by AG Guest</i>, 1st edn 2012]</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The English courts seemed to support the above proposition in that an assignment which was made in contravention of the non-assignment clause was unenforceable against the debtor. The leading case on this point is <i>Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v. Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd and Others and Another Appeal</i> [1993] 3 All ER 417 where the House of Lords held that a contractual prohibition vide cl 17 on the non-assignment of the benefit of a contract is not contrary to public policy. The House of Lords held that prohibitions of such nature are, therefore, enforceable. His Lordship Lord Browne-Wilkinson had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In <i>Hendry v. Chartsearch Ltd</i> [1998] CLC 1382 the English Court of Appeal reiterated its earlier stance in Linden Gardens when it held that where an assignment of contractual rights was prohibited without the prior written consent of the other party, there could be no valid assignment where the consent was not sought before the assignment was made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Text book authors have also lent credence to this proposition in their books. RM Goode in his book <i>Legal Problems of Credit and Security</i> (2nd edn, 1988) at p 123 had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[27] <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (26th edn) vol 1 at para 1413 also expressed a similar view in that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> AG Guest in his book <i>The Law of Assignment</i> (1st edn 2012) stated that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The learned author further added that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Closer to home the Court of Appeal in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_1_265;"><i>Lam Hong Hardware Co Sdn Bhd lwn. Incacon Sdn Bhd &amp; Yang Lain</i> [2006] 1 MLRA 265</LINK>; [2006] 4 MLJ 531; [2006] 2 CLJ 1129 in its majority decision took a similar stance when it held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We share the same view. On the facts of this case, we find that the non-assignment clauses appearing in both the 1996 Contracts and the 1997 Contract were valid and binding on both parties. The two clauses appearing in both contracts prohibiting assignment were not absolute in nature but qualified in the sense once written consent is obtained one party can still assign their rights and benefits under the contract. The non-assignment clauses here expressly laid down that consent was a condition precedent before an assignment can be made. In our judgment, we find that the insertion of the non-assignment clauses as a term of the contract is not in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK>. The non-assignment clause which made consent a precondition before the debts could be assigned did not operate to invalidate the assignment contract as it was a term agreed upon by both parties when they entered into the contract. It is trite that parties are free to enter into a contract with terms and conditions as they deem fit and these terms and condition are binding on the parties who have in the first place agreed to be bound by it. Thus, we hold that there could be no valid assignment if the element of consent under the non-assignment clause is not fulfilled. It was a well-established principle sanctioned by the doctrine of sanctity of contract that parties who make agreement must adhere to their terms.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In our judgment, on the facts of this case, we are unable to accede to the arguments urged upon us by learned counsel for Merita that since a proper notice of assignment in writing had been given by Merita to DBP, it fulfilled the requirement for a valid and binding assignment to take effect under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK>. As we have said earlier the element of consent is a prerequisite before a valid assignment can be made. Thus, the requirements under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA 1956</LINK> with regard to a legal assignment only comes into play if the contract is assignable or the restriction to assign is fulfilled. In the instant case the non-assignment clauses and the element of consent thereunder formed an important term of the contract that parties have agreed. That formed the main prerequisite before the other prerequisites under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the CLA</LINK> could be considered.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The next issue which begs our consideration is whether DBP's consent was indeed obtained by Benatulin prior to the assignment of their rights and benefits of Benatulin's Contract with DBP to M erita. For this purpose, we must examine the conduct of the parties and the events that led to this dispute. From the contemporaneous documents referred to by learned counsel for DBP and Merita, we observe the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It is surprising to note that notwithstanding the arrangement between DBP and Benatulin for the assignment of their rights under the 1997 Contract to CFP, Benatulin had vide letter dated 25 February 1998 written to DBP revoking its instruction in the earlier letters, ie payments to be made to CFP and directed DBP to make all payments to Merita. What prompted them to do this?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The problem lies with regard to the purchases made by DBP vide the said letters issued at different dates before the formal execution of the 1997 Contract. The dispute here was this: Merita had placed reliance on the said letters to say that DBP's purchases were an extension of the 1996 Contracts vide Tender 3/96. Pursuant thereto Merita took the position that based on the assignment in P2, that was executed between them and Benatulin all payments due for the purchases made under the said letters must be made to them and not CFP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The letters relied upon by Merita can be deduced hereunder:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Learned counsel for Merita highlighted that the said letter dated 2 June 1997 from DBP to Benatulin (P7) contained a notification stating that "perlantikan semula syarikat tuan adalah sebagai lanjutan kepada kontrak pembekalan Tender 3/96." Hence, it was for this reason Merita took the position that the purchases made thereunder was subject to the 1996 Contracts and not the 1997 Contract. Merita also submitted that since the aforesaid letter clearly stated that Benatulin's appointment was as an extension to Tender 3/96, DBP was at all times aware that the purchases were made under the 1996 Contracts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In our judgment we find Merita's reliance on P7, P8 and P9 to be misconceived. Whilst we do accept that P7, P8 and P9 made mention of Tender 3/96, however we find that this did not necessarily mean that DBP consented to the assignment of Benatulin's rights to Merita. The language used in the said letters did not support the submissions made by learned counsel for Merita that DBP had acknowledged that the purchases made were an extension to the 1996 Contracts vide Tender 3/96. The caption "lanjutan kepada Tender 3/96" referred to details as to the purchases/orders. It did not relate to the terms of the contract between DBP and Benatulin. We are of the view that P7, P8 and P9 must be viewed in accordance with DBP's letter of appointment dated 30 April 1997 of Benatulin wherein it was clearly stipulated that "<b>perlantikan syarikat tuan ini tertakluk kepada syarat-syarat sepertimana yang terkandung dalam perjanjian yang akan ditandatangani antara DBP dan tuan</b>". [Emphasis Ours]</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The above phrase in italics which we have emphasised in our view to be crucial. It is conceivable that the contract referred to which was to be signed at a later date must be the 1997 Contract. Thus, the reference of Tender 3/96 in P7, P8 and P9 would have meant the assurance of continuity in Benatulin's appointment and similar pattern of purchases as in Tender 3/96 subject to the terms of the contract which was to be executed, ie, the 1997 Contract. We are fortified in coming to this conclusion based on the evidence of DW1 who had clearly and categorically stated that the supply for the 1997 Contract did not form part of Tender 3/96, as no tender was called for the 1997 supply, hence he had in the said letters, referred to the earlier tender, ie Tender 3/96, so that Benatulin would be familiar with the terms of the new supply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In so far as the purported assignment in P2 which formed the basis of Merita's claim, Merita took the position that DBP was put to notice of the said assignment between Benatulin and Merita vide the notice of assignment served on DBP on 27 February 1998. In fact, Merita submitted that notice of assignment had been given by Merita to DBP as early as 23 August 1996 in their letter to DBP of Benatulin's assignment of rights. Merita also placed reliance on the invoices to substantiate their contention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We have subjected these documents to scrutiny. With respect we are unable to agree with Merita's contentions. Since it is our finding that the element of consent is an important prerequisite, the fact that there existed an assignment between Merita and Benatulin did not strengthen Merita's case as the contract stipulated that consent by the debtor (DBP) was a prerequisite before a valid assignment could be made. Nowhere did Merita highlight to us that this has been adhered to. At the risk of repeating ourselves, we reiterate here that it is an implied term of the contract that there could be no assignment by Benatulin of its rights under the 1997 Contract unless the prior written consent of DBP was obtained. An attempted assignment of contractual rights in breach of a contractual prohibition was ineffective to vest the contractual rights in Merita.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Further, it is significant to note that the purported assignment P2 which formed the basis of Merita's claim was dated and stamped on 22 April 1998 although notice of such an assignment was given to DBP as early as 23 August 1996. On this issue the Court of Appeal found that since the assignment at P2 was dated and stamped at a much later date supported the conclusion that the purported assignment in P2 was not served on DBP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In our judgment, the point of critical importance was not whether notice of assignment was given to DBP but whether Benatulin had obtained DBP's consent before executing the assignment with Merita. As we have alluded to earlier since Benatulin had failed to secure DBP's consent, hence DBP was, therefore, not bound to honour Merita's request and had rightfully refused to recognise the instruction by Benatulin to make payment to Merita. The purported assignment which lacked the consent of DBP for the purchases made under the said letters were unenforceable against DBP. It follows that the purported assignment by Benatulin to Merita without the consent of DBP constituted a breach of cl 23 of the 1997 Contract. Merita's claim as an assignee must, therefore, fail. Further, this court cannot allow Merita's claim against DBP as the payment due under the purchases made pursuant to the said letters had already been paid by DBP to Benatulin and CFP.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> To sum up, the irresistible conclusion that can be drawn based on facts and circumstances is that P2 was executed by Benatulin and Merita in clear breach of cl 23 of the 1997 Contract wherein it was clearly stipulated in no uncertain terms that Benatulin must obtain the consent in writing from DBP before they could assign all of their rights under the contract. Since no consent in writing was obtained from DBP by Benatulin for it to assign its rights under the 1997 Contract, DBP was not bound by the assignment in P2 to make any payment to Merita. Applying the principles of law discussed in the preceding paragraphs we hold that the purported assignment in P2 was not binding on DBP. Based on the facts before us we find that the existence of such consent by DBP was wanting. On the other hand, the undisputed facts clearly supported DBP's defence in that based on the consent given to Benatulin for the assignment of the contractual rights under the 1997 Contract monies were duly paid to Benatulin in the sum of RM2,235,768.58 and to CFP in the sum of RM6,258,787.86. Thus, was unjust for Merita to initiate proceedings against DBP for payments that have already been made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> It is trite law that an appellate court will not readily interfere with the findings of fact arrived at by the court of first instance to which the law entrust the primary duty of evaluation of the evidence. However, the appellate court is under a duty to intervene in a case where the trial court has so fundamentally misdirected itself. In our judgment, we find that there was insufficient judicial appreciation by the learned trial judge of the pleadings and contemporaneous evidence in the instant case when she allowed Merita's claim. Such erroneous finding warranted appellate interference which the Court of Appeal rightfully had done so, and we have no reason to disagree. We agree with the Court of Appeal in finding that the learned trial judge erred in finding that the supply made by Benatulin based on the said letters were an extension of the 1996 Contracts. We find that the purchases made by DBP vide the said letters were within the ambit of the 1997 Contract. The trial judge erred in facts and law when she held that the purchases made by DBP vide the said letters was a continuation under the 1996 Contracts pursuant to tender 3/96. The fact of the matter is that the judgment sum as adjudged by the trial judge were monies under the 1997 Contract for which DBP had duly made payments to Benatulin and CFP. The learned trial also erred when she concluded that P2 was an absolute assignment and was not confined to any particular contract. The error of the learned trial judge became more pronounced when she held that the assignment in P2 was binding upon Benatulin, Merita and DBP when in actual fact DBP never consented nor were they privy to the assignment in P2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Under the circumstances, we hereby answer the question of law posed in this appeal in the negative. Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, we hold that consent was a prerequisite before a valid and lawful assignment could be made as under the non-assignment clauses, consent formed an important term of the contract which was binding on both the parties. For the above stated reasons, this appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
