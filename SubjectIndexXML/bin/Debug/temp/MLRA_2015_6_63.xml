    <p>This appeal stemmed from the appellant's action against the respondent for defamation in relation to words that the respondent uttered at a forum subsequently published in an article in two local newspapers. The appellant was a private company and sole supplier and distributor of water in Selangor and the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. The respondent, amongst others, was a member of the Democratic Action Party and held the position of National Publicity Secretary. The appellant claimed that the respondent uttered the defamatory words at the forum urging the appellant to return the management rights of water supply to the Selangor State Government because the appellant was unable to pay its debts or replace water pipes as a result of which the appellant had made improper claims to raise water tariffs for its own benefit. The appellant claimed that the respondent was motivated by malice and could not rely in the defences of justification and qualified privilege. Further, the respondent was motivated by political gain in uttering the impugned words and was reckless as to whether they were true. Also, that the respondent had no honest belief in what he said. The respondent did not dispute that he uttered the impugned words but claimed they were not defamatory of the appellant. He raised the defence of qualified privilege on the grounds of public interest, namely, the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege based on the House of Lords' decision in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd</i> ('<i>Reynolds</i> case') and the defence of justification. The respondent also counterclaimed for damages for abuse of the court's process and unnecessary harassment for the reason that there was no basis for the appellant to file the action. The High Court allowed the appellant's claim and the respondent was ordered to pay RM200,000 in general damages but the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court's orders on appeal resulting in the instant appeal before the Federal Court. The relevant questions addressed were: (i) whether the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence was available to an individual who was not a journalist; (ii) whether in relying on the said defence, the respondent had to show that responsible and fair steps were taken to gather, verify and publish the information; (iii) whether it was sufficient to merely have an honest belief that the statement(s) were true, even if the statement(s) were in fact untrue; and (iv) whether there existed a defence of justification based on "reasonable grounds for suggesting".</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence was predicated on public interest and "responsible journalism". The public interest defence should not be synonymous with journalists or media publications. It should be extended to anyone who published or disclosed material of public interest in any medium to assist the public to better comprehend and make an informed decision on matters of public interest that affected their lives. However, anyone accorded that privilege must meet the test of responsible journalism which underpins the significance of protecting the right of freedom of expression on public interest and at the same time providing adequate protection for reputation. Freedom of expression was not absolute. The <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence placed a considerable role in the hands of judges to deliberate fairly and to come to a just decision with utmost care whether the impugned publication amounted to an occasion of privilege. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The public test requirement for the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence was fulfilled as the impugned words uttered by the respondent concerned the operation and management of water supply services, which indisputably was a public concern. As for "responsible journalism", the respondent had known that the non-replacement of water pipes and the cash flow problems faced by the appellant were the result of the freeze of capital expenditure works and the refusal of the Selangor State Government to agree to a proposed tariff hike and as such could not be the fault of the appellant. The respondent deliberately withheld that information. The omission to disclose the gist of the appellant's side of the story would result in an unfair and misleading report and would go against the concept of responsible journalism. The respondent therefore failed the responsible journalism test in failing to take responsible and fair steps to gather, verify and publish the impugned words. Accordingly, the respondent did not succeed on the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence of qualified privilege. (paras 34, 35, 42, 43 &amp; 44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The respondent's plea of justification within the <i>Lucas-Box</i> meaning was properly pleaded. That plea of justification required the respondent to prove his own reasonable meaning to the impugned words (<i>Lucas-Box v. Associated Newspapers Group Plc &amp; Ors</i>). The respondent first denied that the impugned words carried any defamatory meaning and that the meanings given to them were true in substance and in fact. The respondent then proceeded to plead particulars to support the meanings he gave to the impugned words. He pleaded with clarity as to the meaning he attributed to the impugned words, which was different from the meaning understood by the appellant. The appellant knew what case it had to meet and the meaning that the respondent sought to attribute to the impugned words. (paras 50-54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was no suspicion and/or allegation by the respondent that the appellant had insufficient funds or was incompetent to handle the water business. The respondent merely suggested that 'if' that was the case, the water management operations should be returned to the Selangor State Government. It was important not to lose sight of that point. Considered in that way, a plea of justification by way of "reasonable suggestion", fell within the lowest limb propounded by <i>Chase v. Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd</i>, ie "there are grounds for investigating whether he/she was responsible for such an act". All of which led to the conclusion that on the facts of the present case the respondent's plea of "reasonable grounds for suggesting" was a valid plea for justification. (para 55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The respondent sought to prove (i) that the appellant was facing financial difficulties (ii) that the Selangor State Government had undertaken serious negotiations with the appellant and the Federal Government to take over control of the water management rights from the appellant (iii) that the appellant had not undertaken capital expenditure due to its financial problems, and (iv) that unless the appellant was able to secure the 37% tariff hike, it would not be able to continue with the provision of the water services. The sting of the impugned words was that there were reasonable grounds for suggesting that the appellant was facing financial difficulties and as such, it should return the water management rights to the State Government. The respondent's defence of justification rested primarily on the evidence of the appellant's own Chief Executive Officer (PW4). As such, the facts showed that the impugned words were capable of bearing the reasonable meaning ascribed by the respondent. It followed therefore that the respondent succeeded in the defence of justification. (paras 56-61)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The answers to the questions were as follows (i) the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence was available to an individual who was not a journalist (ii) it was a crucial element in a defence of <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege that the defendant had to show that responsible and fair steps were taken to gather, verify and publish the information; (iii) it was not sufficient to merely have an honest belief that the statement(s) were true, and (iv) on the facts and circumstances of the present case the plea of "reasonable grounds for suggesting" did amount to a valid plea for the defence of justification.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Azahar Mohamed FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that reversed the judgment of the High Court. The appeal arises from an action brought in the High Court by the appellant, Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd (the plaintiff in the High Court). The appellant sued the respondent, Tony Pua Kiam Wee (the defendant in the High Court) for defamation in relation to words that he uttered at a forum that were later published in an article in two local newspapers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We will describe the parties in this judgment as they appear in the High Court, namely the appellant as the plaintiff and the respondent as the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The High Court had on 6 June 2012, after full trial, allowed the plaintiff's claim and ordered the defendant to pay RM200,000.00 in general damages. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal and on 27 March 2013, the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court orders. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff applied for leave to appeal to the Federal Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> and on 18 March 2014, this court granted leave to appeal to the plaintiff on five questions of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The background facts are very straightforward. The plaintiff is a company incorporated to undertake the privatisation of water supply services in the State of Selangor and the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya ("the Concession Area"). The plaintiff is the sole supplier and distributor of water in the Concession Area.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The defendant is a member of the Democratic Action Party, holding the post of National Publicity Secretary. The defendant was elected to the Malaysian Parliament by the constituency of Petaling Jaya Utara in 2008. The defendant is a member of the Malaysian Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee. The defendant is also a member of the Selangor State Government Water Review Panel appointed by the Selangor State Government. He is also an active contributor to public debate on public interest issues in Malaysia, including the issue of water supply rights.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 28 January 2011, the plaintiff commenced legal proceedings against the defendant for defamation in relation to words uttered by the defendant at a forum on 14 November 2010 ("the Impugned Words"), which were subsequently published in an article in Nanyang Siang Pau, the Metro Edition on 16 November 2010. The agreed English translation of the article, as reproduced in the judgment of the High Court, with the Impugned Words appearing in bold reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The plaintiff contended that it had been disparaged in its business reputation, goodwill and commercial credit by reason of the publication of the Impugned Words. The plaintiff also contended that the Impugned Words in their natural and ordinary meaning and by way of innuendo, were libelous of it and meant or were understood to mean that the plaintiff was incompetent in managing water supply rights as it was unable to pay its debts or to replace water pipes; and given that it was not able to pay its debts, the plaintiff was making improper claims to raise water tariffs, which was only for its own benefit. The plaintiff averred that the defendant was motivated by malice and could not seek refuge in the defences of justification and qualified privilege. It was the plaintiff's case that the defendant was motivated by political gain in uttering the Impugned Words and was reckless as to whether or not they were true. It was also the plaintiff's case that the defendant had no honest belief in what he said.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The defendant did not dispute that he uttered the Impugned Words. However, the defendant pleaded that the Impugned Words were not defamatory of the plaintiff. Alternatively, the defendant raised some important contentions. In his pleaded defence, the defendant raised, amongst others, the defence of qualified privilege, particularly <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege and the defence of justification. The defendant also brought a counterclaim for what he alleged to be an abuse of process of the Court and 'unnecessary harassment' for the reason that there was no basis for the plaintiff to file the action in the first place. The defendant claimed damages for that.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As indicated earlier, the High Court, after a trial that took four days, allowed the plaintiff's claim and found the defendant liable for the sum of RM200,000.00 as general damages, with interest and costs. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed. The High Court held that the plaintiff had successfully proven the three basic elements required to maintain its action in defamation, namely that the Impugned Words uttered by the defendant bore defamatory imputations; the Impugned Words referred to the plaintiff; and the Impugned Words were published to third parties. The High Court found that the Impugned Words carried the following meanings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In coming to its decision, the High Court held that before the defendant could rely on the defence of qualified privilege (<i>Reynolds</i> Privilege), the defendant had to satisfy the two requirements as set out in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [2001] 2 AC 127, in that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The High Court went on to find that the defendant had succeeded in the first limb but had failed in respect of the second limb, essentially because he had known that the non-replacement of water pipes and mains and the cash flow problems faced by the plaintiff were the result of the freeze of capital expenditure works and the refusal of the Selangor State Government to agree to a proposed tariff hike; but the defendant nevertheless failed to convey the true reasons for the plaintiff's inability to pay its debts and replace the water pipes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In relation to the defence of justification, the High Court found that the defendant had not pleaded the defence of justification in relation to the Impugned Words; and in any event, defendant had failed to prove that it was the plaintiff's incompetence or mismanagement which had led it to be unable to pay its debts or to replace the water pipes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In allowing the defendant's appeal, the Court of Appeal found that the Impugned Words were defamatory only to the extent of the following defamatory imputations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In relation to qualified privilege, the Court of Appeal held that the defendant was entitled to succeed on the defence of qualified privilege (<i>Reynolds</i> Privilege) as he had satisfied the duty and interest tests as propounded in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> On the defendant's plea of justification, the Court of Appeal found that the defendant had pleaded his own reasonable meaning of the Impugned Words and had sought to justify the meanings based on facts pleaded in his defence. The Court of Appeal held that this form of justification was permitted in law as established in <i>Lucas-Box v. Associated Newspapers Group Plc &amp; Ors</i> [1986] 1 All ER 177. The admissions by the plaintiff's Chief Executive Officer (PW4) during cross-examination supported the meanings to the Impugned Words ascribed by the defendant in relation to the plaintiff' financial status. For that reason, the Court of Appeal found that the defendant had proven his defence of justification. The Court of Appeal added that in respect of the defamatory imputations, the contents of the report were sufficiently true to allow the defence of justification to succeed pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;8.;;">s 8 of the Defamation Act 1957</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Questions Of Law On Appeal To The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> As mentioned earlier, this court granted leave to the plaintiff to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the following five questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Questions 1, 2, and 3 deal with the defence of <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege. They concern the scope of the application and the elements required to be established before such a defence can be successfully relied on or defeated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Whilst the remaining Questions 4 and 5 relate to issues concerning the defence of justification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> It has to be highlighted at this point that both the plaintiff and the defendant did not appeal to this court against the finding of the Court of Appeal that the Impugned Words uttered by the defendant were libelous only to the extent of the defamatory imputations that the plaintiff had insufficient funds to pay its debt and the plaintiff was incompetent in handling its business operations since it could not pay its debt. We will therefore confine our consideration to the defences raised by the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We will deal first with the defence of <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In his pleaded defence, the defendant contended that the Impugned Words was on a matter of undisputed public interest as it concerned the subject matter of water rights; the consumers and the public had a right to know the facts relating this basic right. Moreover, the defendant contended that as a Member of Parliament and a member of the Water Review Panel, he had a legal and social duty or interest to publish the article and the public had a corresponding interest in receiving the same. It was against this background that we should view the contention of the defendant that the publication of the Impugned Words was an occasion of qualified privilege as enumerated in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i>.</p>

      <b>[22]</b> As a matter of broad general principle, a privileged occasion is one on which the privileged person is entitled or permitted to do or utter something which no one who is not within the privilege is entitled or permitted to do on that occasion, without incurring the liability for defamation. The defence of qualified privilege is grounded on public policy and convenience that the law will, on occasion, allow an individual to make statements which are defamatory and untrue of another without incurring legal liability (see for example <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_508;"><i>Hasnul Abdul Hadi v. Bulat Mohamed &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 508</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> This then brings us into sharp focus the very important English House of Lords case of <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> concerning qualified privilege for publication of defamatory statements in the public interest. This much quoted case provides a good starting point. It is worth to set out the essential background facts. In that case, Mr Reynolds had been the Prime Minister of Ireland, until a political crisis in 1994. He began proceedings for defamation against the Times, the publisher of an article contained in the British mainland edition of a national newspaper. The publication related to an article to the effect that Mr Reynolds had misled the Irish Parliament. Mr Reynolds claimed that the words complained of bore the meaning that he had deliberately and dishonestly misled the Parliament and his cabinet colleagues. The Times pleaded, <i>inter alia</i>, the defence of qualified privilege at common law. At the trial the jury returned a verdict in Mr Reynolds's favour and he was awarded damages. The Court of Appeal set aside the jury's verdict and ordered a retrial on the ground of misdirection to the jury. The court also ruled that the publication was not covered by qualified privilege. The Times appealed, contending that the courts should recognise a generic qualified privilege encompassing the publication by a newspaper of political matters affecting the people of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The House of Lords rejected this contention and held that the common law should not develop a new subject matter category of qualified privilege whereby the publication of all political information would attract qualified privilege whatever the circumstances, since that would fail to provide adequate protection for reputation. It was held that it would be unsound in principle to distinguish political information from other matters of public concern. The House of Lords agreed that the traditional ambit of qualified privilege should be extended somewhat and that it was available in respect of political information upon application of the established common law test of whether there had been a duty to publish the material to the intended recipients and whether they had had an interest in receiving it. The decision marked a decisive departure from the traditional pro-reputation orientation of defamation law in England and was quickly recognised as a 'media-friendly development' (see <i>Grant v. Torstar Corp</i> [2009] SCC 61). As a result of <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> there is now a much more extensive protection for publications to the world at large where the matter is of sufficient public concern. This is known as <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege. Lord Hoffman in <i>Jameel (Mohammed) and Another v. Wall Street Journal Europe</i> [2007] 1 AC 359, on the other hand said it might be more appropriately be called <i>Reynolds</i> public interest defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On the implication and significance of <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i>, specifically on the question of 'responsible journalism', it is useful we refer to the judgment of Lord Carswell in the Privy Council case of <i>Seaga v. Harper</i> [2008] 1 All ER 965:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> A feature of the present defamation action brought by the plaintiff was that it was premised on an article, which the defendant did not personally pen or publish. Instead, the article contained a republication of the Impugned Words uttered by the defendant, at a forum where reporters were present. It is pertinent to note that the defendant was not a journalist when he uttered the Impugned Words.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Here arises an important question that we have to consider: whether the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence is available to an individual who is not a journalist or is it available only to the press and broadcasting media? Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that if one looked at the principle behind the application of <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege, that was to say, news being perishable and urgent and indeed the guidelines for responsible journalism, the better view was that taken by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Kearns v. General Council of the Bar</i> [2003] 2 All ER 534 in that it should be limited only to journalists or media publications.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In <i>Kearns v. General Council of the Bar (supra)</i>, the Court of Appeal held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> However, the courts have since then taken a somewhat different approach. In <i>Jameel (Mohammed) and Another v. Wall Street Journal Europe (supra)</i> Lord Hoffmann held thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The next case of particular importance is the case of <i>Seaga v. Harper (supra)</i>, where the Privy Council rejected the view of <i>Kearns v. General Council of the Bar (supra)</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In <i>Charman v. Orion Publishing Group Ltd</i> [2008] 1 All ER 750, the English Court of Appeal came to a similar conclusion:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Nearer home, we were informed that the only reported decision on this issue was the High Court's decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_1_430;"><i>Sivabalan P Asapathy v. The New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</i> [2010] 1 MLRH 430</LINK>; [2010] 9 MLJ 320; [2010] 7 CLJ 885, which cited with approval the judgment of <i>Jameel (Mohammed) and Another v. Wall Street Journal Europe (supra)</i> to the effect that the defence is available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In our view, the public interest defence should by no means synonymous with journalists or media publications. On the ground of public interest, there is a sufficient basis it should be in the same way extended to anyone who publishes or discloses material of public interest in any medium to assist the public comprehend better and make an informed decision on matters of public interest that affects their lives. To safeguard the extension of this privilege is not abused, as a necessary balance, it is the duty of the court to robustly ensure that anyone who is accorded with the privilege meet the test of responsible journalism, about which more will be said later in this judgment. This, in our view, underpins the significance of protecting the right of freedom of expression on public interest matter and at the same time providing adequate protection for reputation. Freedom of expression is not absolute. Indeed, freedom of expression and the responsibilities that comes with it is enshrined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. We should like to emphasise here that the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence places a considerable role in the hands of judges to deliberate fairly and come to a just decision with utmost care whether the impugned publication amount to an occasion of privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence is predicated on public interest and 'responsible journalism'. In the context of the present case, the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence required the defendant first, to establish that the Impugned Words were uttered on a matter of public interest and the public had a corresponding interest in receiving the same. Once that was established, the court must consider whether the defendant acted reasonably in publishing the Impugned Words. This second test has been described as the test of 'responsible journalism' (see <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> and <i>Jameel (Mohammed) and Another v. Wall Street Journal Europe (supra)</i>. Although the test refers to 'journalism', it is merely a convenient description because as we have decided earlier the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence is in no way limited to journalistic publications. If the defendant passed the test of responsible journalism, the issue would be determined in his favour. Lord Nicholls in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> sets out a number of factors to be taken into account in determining the issue of responsible journalism. These factors, which are not exhaustive, are, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In the present case, the Impugned Words uttered by the defendant were on a matter of public interest. Undeniably, the Impugned Words concerned the operation and management of water supply services. In fact, this was an indisputable fact. Therefore, the first test for the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence to apply had been fulfilled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The first test did not raise any serious difficulty. When it came to the second test, though, the defendant ran into difficulties. The question that arises is this: whether the requisite of 'responsible journalism' had been fulfilled. This is the main area of concern. In the context of the present case, the key part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The passage above, in our view, raises some serious problems. The Court of Appeal held that for the defendant to successfully rely on <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence, it was sufficient to merely have an honest belief that the Impugned Words were true, even if the words were in fact untrue; once all relevant information was in the public domain, then, the defendant was not obliged to satisfy the further <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege requirements. We note that the Court of Appeal made no reference to the test of 'responsible journalism'. It would appear that the Court of Appeal completely overlooked this crucial point.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In this regard, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the Court of Appeal had applied the correct test in adopting the circumstantial test, which looked at the circumstances of the publication to ensure that such publication was proper. He argued that the circumstantial test and the responsible journalism test was ultimately the same, as they look into similar if not the same factors in order to determine whether the publication of the Impugned Words is warranted. As such, he argued, the circumstantial test applied by the Court of Appeal was the correct test as it sufficiently took into account the defendant's conduct and the nature and tone of the Impugned Words in determining the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In our judgment, the submissions of the learned counsel for the defendant pose at least two problems. In the first place, the responsible journalism guidelines have consistently been upheld since <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> was decided by the House of Lords. As we see it, the 'circumstantial test' and the 'reasonable journalism test' was not the same. In fact, as pointed out by Lord Hope in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> 'the circumstantial test is confusing and it should not be adopted'. The guidelines as advocated by Lord Nicholls set out a number of important relevant matters to be taken into consideration in deciding whether the publication of impugned statements was privileged for the reason of its significance to the public at large. The list was not all-inclusive, but was explanatory only, and the weight to be given to those and other pertinent aspects would vary from case to case. Secondly, according to the Court of Appeal, a defendant relying on the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence was absolved from proving that he took responsible and fair steps to gather, verify and publish the information, by simply claiming that he had an honest belief in the truth of the statements he made. With respect, this is plainly wrong. We agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the plaintiff that these new propositions by the Court of Appeal are diametrically opposed to the guidelines on responsible journalism as set out in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i>. In our view the guidelines on responsible journalism as espoused in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> is important because there is now a much more extensive protection for publications to the public at large where the matter is of sufficient public concern. For that reason, as a counter-balance, publishers must meet the test of responsible journalism to ensure that the privilege is not abused. Rights and responsibilities must go hand in hand. Freedom of speech is not an end in itself; it must be exercised with a sense of responsibility. This point has already been made earlier but ought to be restated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> As noted earlier, the Court of Appeal held that "once all relevant information is in the public domain, then, the defendant is not obliged to satisfy the further <i>Reynolds</i> requirements". Emphasising this point, to support this proposition of law, the Court of Appeal in its judgment cited para 14.3 of <i>Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander</i>, 11th edn. On this, it is instructive to refer to said paragraph, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> As submitted by learned counsel for the plaintiff, a closer reading of the above passage did not support the Court of Appeal proposition of law. Clearly, the opinion in <i>Gatley</i> went further to say that parts of the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege test dealing with issues of reasonable of conduct (for example, whether steps have been taken to verify the information) were relevant. He further argued that a far reaching implication of the Court of Appeal's proposition was that it would allow defendants to publish untrue defamatory statements, simply because the State of affairs had already been published before in the public domain. We see much force in this argument. We agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that this cannot be right as such a proposition runs counter to the very concept of fair and responsible journalism.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> There is one aspect of the decision of the High Court that deserves our attention. It is this: the High Court found that the defendant had known that the non-replacement of water pipes and mains and the cash flow problems faced by the plaintiff were the result of the freeze of capital expenditure works and the refusal of the Selangor State Government to agree to a proposed tariff hike and not the plaintiff's own fault. The defendant deliberately withheld this information, which would have explained the plaintiff's position and indeed did nothing to elicit a response from the plaintiff. On the contrary, the Court of Appeal held that the occasion might be privileged even if the defendant failed to disclose all the relevant facts. With respect, in so deciding, the Court of Appeal failed to judiciously appreciate that omitting to disclose the gist of the plaintiff's side of the story would result in an unfair and misleading report and would go against the concept of responsible journalism.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In his submissions, learned counsel for the plaintiff took us through the evidence of the defendant at the trial during cross-examination. The evidence disclosed that the defendant had omitted to publish information, which he was in possession of, which would have shown the plaintiff's side of the story, in that the non-replacement of water pipes and mains and the cash flow constraints were not due to the plaintiff's own fault. We should remind ourselves that in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i>, Lord Nicholls held that omitting the plaintiff's explanation of the version of events would result in an unfair and inaccurate report, which would be misleading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In our judgment, the Court of Appeal had failed to consider that the defendant's knowledge of the plaintiff's true position and failure to disclose these facts would suggest that his conduct was unreasonable and would go against the concept of responsible journalism. In our judgment, the defendant had failed the responsible journalism test in failing to take responsible and fair steps to gather, verify and publish the Impugned Words. The Court of Appeal overlooked this point. Accordingly, we find that the Court of Appeal had erred in finding that the defendant had succeeded on the <i>Reynolds</i> Privilege defence of qualified privilege as set out in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspaper Ltd (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Justification</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> This area of law is well settled. As a matter of general rule, the defence of justification is a complete defence to a defamation action (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1977_1_508;"><i>Hasnul Abdul Hadi v. Bulat Mohamed &amp; Anor</i> [1977] 1 MLRH 508</LINK> and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_4_877;"><i>Tun Datuk Patinggi Haji Abdul Rahman Ya'kub v. Bre Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1995] 4 MLRH 877</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 393). The burden is on the defendant to show that the defamatory imputations are substantially true.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> An important point to note is that the defendant did not plead justification to the meanings pleaded by the plaintiff. The part of his defence that deals with justification is in para 7 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> What the defendant had done was to plead justification to what is known as <i>Lucas-Box</i> meaning, that is to say, the plea of justification by proving the defendant's own reasonable meaning to the Impugned Words as set out in para 6 of his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that a perusal of para 6 of the defence showed that in actual fact, the defendant had not even pleaded a defence of justification of the truth of meanings of the Impugned Words that he ascribed, but instead pleaded that "there were and are reasonable grounds for suggesting" the meanings. He then cited the case of <i>Chase v. Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 1772. Learned counsel submitted that the English Court of Appeal in that case held at para 45 that there could be three different categories of meaning for the defence of justification:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Based on the above passage, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that a plea of 'reasonable grounds for suggesting' did not amount to a valid plea for the defence of justification. He submitted that whilst it was apparent from <i>Chase v. Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i> that the court had recognised the defence of "reasonable suspicion" as a lower level of defamatory meaning, which may be justified, there was no authority on whether there also existed a defence of justification based on "reasonable grounds to suggest".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We are not persuaded by this line of arguments. In our judgment, the Court of Appeal rightly held that the defendant had properly pleaded the <i>Lucas-Box</i> meaning. This plea originated from the Court of Appeal's decision in <i>Lucas-Box v. Associated Newspapers Group Pic &amp; Ors (supra)</i>. In delivering his judgment, Ackner LJ explained as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Further down in his judgment, Ackner LJ added as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In substance, the <i>Lucas-Box</i> plea of justification as decided by the English Court of Appeal is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We now need to turn our attention, and look more closely to paras 6 &amp; 7 of the amended defence and counterclaim of the defendant, which read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> We should also note that the defendant sought to justify his own pleaded meaning of the Impugned Words by relying on paras 2 until 4 of the amended defence and counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In our judgment, a perusal of paras 6 and 7 above, which have to be read together, shows that the defendant had clearly and expressly pleaded the <i>Lucas- Box</i> meaning. The defendant first denied that the Impugned Words carried any defamatory meaning. He then went on to contend that the meanings set out in para 6 were true in substance and in fact. This was in accordance with the method of a <i>Lucas-Box</i> plea. The defendant proceeded to plead particulars to support the meanings he gave to the Impugned Words (see <i>Polly Peck (Holdings) Plc v. Trelford</i> [1986] 2 All ER 84, <i>Viscount De Lisle v. Times Newspapers</i> [1987] 3 All ER 499, <i>Elaine Chase v. News Group Newspapers Ltd</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 1772 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_2_86;"><i>Mirzan Mahathir v. Star Papyrus Sdn Bhd</i> [2000] 2 MLRH 86</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 29; [2000] 5 CLJ 507). In our view, the defendant had pleaded with clarity as to the meaning he attributed to the Impugned Words, which was different from the meaning understood by the plaintiff. The plaintiff knew what case it had to meet and the meaning, which the defendant sought to attribute to the Impugned Words.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> There is one issue that calls for specific attention. As can be seen earlier, learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that that the plea of 'reasonable grounds for suggesting' did not amount to a valid plea for the defence of justification. On this, it is important to bear in mind that there was never any suspicion and/ or allegation by the defendant that the plaintiff had insufficient funds or was incompetent to handle the water business. It is important to appreciate that the defendant merely suggested that 'if' that was the case, the water management operations should be returned to the State Government. It is important not to lose sight of this point. Considered in that way, we agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the defendant that a plea of justification by way of 'reasonable suggestion", at least falls within the lowest limb propounded by <i>Chase v. Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd (supra)</i>, that is to say, "there are grounds for investigating whether he/she has been responsible for such an act" (see <i>McDonald's Corp and Anor v. Steel and Anor</i> [1995] 3 All ER 615 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_2_349;"><i>Raphael Pura v. Insas Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2002] 2 MLRA 349</LINK>; [2003] 1 MLJ 513; [2003] 1 CLJ 61; [2000] 4 AMR 4475). All of which leads us to conclude that on the facts of the present case the defendant's plea of 'reasonable grounds for suggesting' is a valid plea for justification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> As stated by the Court of Appeal, the defendant's reasonable meaning to the Impugned Words as pleaded meant that there were reasonable grounds to suggest that the plaintiff was facing financial difficulties and for this reason, it ought to return the water management right to the State Government. Based on this meaning of the Impugned Words, the defendant sought out to prove that the plaintiff was indeed facing financial difficulties; that the State Government had undertaken serious negotiations with the plaintiff and the Federal Government with the view to taking over control of the water management rights from the plaintiff; that the plaintiff had not undertaken capital expenditure due to its financial problems and that unless the plaintiff was able to secure the 37% tariff hike, it would not be able to continue with the provision of the water services.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The sting of the Impugned Words is a finding of fact, which the Court of Appeal was fully entitled to make, considering that both parties pleaded their own meanings of the Impugned Words.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> A defendant will have sufficiently proven the defence of justification if he is able to prove the truth or the substantial truth of his own meanings of the impugned words (see <i>Moore v. News of the World</i> [1972] 1 All ER 915, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2014_6_486;"><i>Khalid Yusoff v. Pertubuhan Berita Nasional Malaysia (Bernama) &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 6 MLRH 486</LINK>; [2014] 8 CLJ 337; [2014] 6 AMR 397 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_2_61;"><i>Cheah Cheng Hoc &amp; Ors v. Liew Yew Tiam &amp; Ors (No 2)</i> [2000] 2 MLRH 61</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 204; [2000] 5 CLJ 475; [2000] 2 AMR 2444).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The sting of the Impugned Words as pleaded by the defendant was that there were reasonable grounds for suggesting that the plaintiff was facing financial difficulties and as such, it should return the water management rights to the State Government. Learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the defendant had successfully proved the truth and/or the substantial truth of the sting of the Impugned Words. It is material to point out that the defendant's defence of justification rested primarily on the evidence of the plaintiff's Chief Executive Officer (PW4). PW4 admitted to the following matters during cross-examination:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The Court of Appeal held that based on the evidence of PW4 the Impugned Words were capable of bearing the reasonable meaning ascribed by the defendant in that the plaintiff was facing financial difficulties and for that reason, it ought to return the water management rights to the State Government. In its judgment, the Court of Appeal concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> On the facts of the present case, we agree with the finding of the Court of Appeal that the Impugned Words were capable of bearing the reasonable meaning ascribed by the defendant. The finding was clearly justified and correct based on the evidence led before the High Court. It has not been successfully shown to us that the findings of the Court of Appeal on this issue were against the weight of evidence or perverse in any way, warranting our intervention. We therefore agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the defendant had succeeded in the defence of justification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In the result, based on all the reasons given, our answers to the questions are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In consequence, this appeal must fail. We accordingly dismiss it.</p>
