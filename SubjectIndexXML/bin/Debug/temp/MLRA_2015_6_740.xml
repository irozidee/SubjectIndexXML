    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was appealing against the decision of the trial judge in dismissing its claim for loss of income pursuant to the acquisition of a piece of land ('the land') that was leased to the appellant for 24 years. The main issue was whether the loss of income derived from the sale of petrol and diesel at the petrol station on the land was claimable under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960 ('the 1960 Act')</LINK>. The appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to consider: (i) that loss of income was claimable under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">1960 Act</LINK> ie under para 2(d) read with para 2(e) of the First Schedule of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">1960 Act</LINK>; (ii) that the word "property" or "property" read with the words "immovable" and "in any other manner" in para 2(d) of the First Schedule of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">1960 Act</LINK> included loss of income and in that regard the learned judge had allowed the application for land reference by the petrol station operator on the same land as opposed to the appellant as lessee of the land; (iii) that the amendment on para 2(d) of the First Schedule of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">1960 Act</LINK> by deleting the word "or his actual earning" did not remove the compensation for loss of income; (iv) that the appellant's loss of temporary fixed income was reasonable expense incidental to the change of residence or place of business of the appellant; (v) that that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> did not allow for compulsory Land Acquisition without adequate compensation; (vi) that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">1960 Act</LINK> did not differentiate between a petrol station operator and a supplier of the petrol and that all persons having an interest on the land, which the appellant was one, should be compensated, and; (vii) that the appellant's loss of income was proven since the respondent did not challenge the evidence thereto.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The grounds of appeal raised by the appellant had no merit. From the grounds of judgment, the trial judge had considered all the issues respectively, including <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. Loss of income was not reasonable expenses incidental to the change of residence or place of business and as such was not compensation that was claimable. (paras 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16 &amp; 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The application for land reference by the petrol station operator was not referred to in the grounds of judgment. Since it was not raised in the skeletal written submissions of the parties concerned, it did not matter that the trial judge did not consider the issue. (para 9)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The specific submission that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">1960 Act</LINK> did not differentiate between a petrol station operator and a supplier of the petrol was not made before the High Court. Nor was it made before this court. The issue was what was authorised by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">1960 Act</LINK> as compensation and that had been dealt with adequately. (para 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The fact that the respondent did not challenge the evidence regarding the appellant's interest and loss of income did not mean that the appellant's loss was proven. Given that the question of law was whether such "loss" was recoverable, there was no merit in that submission. (paras 19-20)</p>

  <JUDGMENT>
    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The applicant, ExxonMobil Malaysia Sdn Bhd ("the appellant") appealed against the decision of the High Court to sustain the award of compensation by the respondent, Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Petaling ("the respondent") and to disallow its application with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The award arose from the acquisition under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK> of land bearing the registry description, Lot No PT 17727 (1854) Gm No 225707 Pekan Puchong, Daerah Petaling, Selangor ("the land") vide Gazette Notification No WKN Mo 3144 Warta Kerajaan Negeri Selangor dated 10 September 2009. The land was registered in the name of Pilihan Megah Sdn Bhd and leased to the appellant for a period of 24 years ending 15 November 2019.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The legal and only issue before the High Court was whether loss of income derived from the sale of petrol and diesel at the appellant's petrol station operated on the land can be claimed under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK>. The High Court held that such loss of income was not claimable under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The following addresses the Grounds of Appeal before this court.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and paras 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Grounds of Judgment demonstrated that the High Court fully appreciated and considered respectively the appellant's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Not only did the High Court decide upon whether the loss of income was claimable under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK>, <i>inter alia</i>, under para 2(d) read with para 2(e) of the First Schedule of the said Act, paras 17, 18, 19 and 20 demonstrated the reasoning process by which the High Court arrived at its decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In the circumstances, we find no merit in the first ground of appeal as stated.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Paragraphs 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Grounds of Judgment demonstrated that the High Court did consider and decide upon the question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The application for land reference by one Tremendous Growth Sdn Bhd vide Land Reference No 15-82-10-2011 was not referred to in the Grounds of Judgment. Since it was not raised in the skeletal written submissions for the applicant, or the respondent for that matter, we do not think it a matter for complaint that the High Court did not consider. A court appreciates and considers the case for the parties, and renders its decision with reasoning within an adversarial system in which it is for counsel professing to be qualified and therefore admitted to practice before the court, to submit before the court what needs to be considered by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The land reference for Tremendous Growth Sdn Bhd vide Land Reference No 15-82-10-2011 was mentioned by "In this regard ..." in the Grounds of Appeal. At paras 36-38 referred to the case. The footnote referred to pp 7-12 of the Additional Record of Appeal. That is part of the Notes of Proceedings of the High Court on 22 March 2013 when a number of land references cases were heard. Pages 7-12 were the notes of submissions made but shows no decision and reasoning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Nor was opportunity taken when filing the written submissions in reply of the appellant, to remedy the shortcoming.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> There was, therefore, before this court nothing to support the submission that the High Court had made a contrary decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We dismissed this ground, therefore, as wholly without merit.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Paragraph 6 of the Grounds of Judgment demonstrated that the High Court appreciated the submission made, and the same paragraphs above referred to, and in particular para 17, the reasoning behind the decision that rejected the submission. A court is bound to make an independent, fair and just decision. That the court did not arrive at a conclusion as submitted by the counsel does not warrant a complaint that the court did not consider and decide in its favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In the circumstances, Ground 3 as formulated is without basis.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Paragraph 18, in our view, amply explained that the compensation which are claimable are the reasonable expenses, if any, incidental to the change of residence or place of business of the applicant, but not loss of income.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The point was submitted before the High Court. Paragraph 16 of the Grounds of Judgment demonstrated that the High Court did have in mind <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. In the circumstances, Ground 5 is wholly unwarranted and without merit.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The specific submission that <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK> does not differentiate between a petrol station operator and a supplier of the petrol was not made before the High Court. Nor was it made before this court. In our view, the issue is what is authorised by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1992_486;;">Land Acquisition Act 1960</LINK> as compensation and that had been dealt with adequately.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> This last ground seeks to argue that the fact that the respondent had not challenged the evidence regarding the appellant's interest and loss of income (in terms of formula and quantum) and therefore should have taken that into consideration and decide that the appellant's loss is proven.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In our view, given that the question of law is whether such "loss" is recoverable, the paucity of the submission is obvious. We dismissed it at without merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal, fixed costs in the sum of RM10,000.00 and ordered the deposit be refunded.</p>
