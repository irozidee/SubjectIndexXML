    <p>The respondent had brought an action against the appellants for payment of RM20m for services rendered in procuring a Government project for the appellants under a letter of undertaking. The project which was to replace the Johor-Singapore causeway, did not materialise. The High Court in rejecting the respondent's claim held that since the project did not materialise, the respondent was not entitled to payment under the letter of undertaking. The High Court rejected the argument that it was the project and not the award that was withdrawn. The Court of Appeal however accepted that line of argument and allowed the respondent's claim for the simple reason that the letter of undertaking referred to the award of the project as opposed to the project itself. The appellants appealed and the question was whether an agreement to provide services to influence the decision of a public decision maker to award a contract was a contract opposed to public policy as defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e) of the Contracts Act 1950 ('the Act')</LINK> and therefore void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was wrong in law to uphold an illegal contract from the aspect and on the basis of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>. If it were to be decided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2</LINK>, then <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Act</LINK> and its purpose to render void the stated unlawful consideration and unlawful objects, would be rendered ineffective, meaningless and of no use at all. (para 70)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Whenever the illegality of a contract was raised or became apparent, it was the duty of the court to take it up by reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Act</LINK>. In <i>David Wong Hon Leong v. Noorazman Adnan</i>, the allegation of illegality was not considered by reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e) of the Act</LINK> and the pertinent case law. The case relied on to rule against illegality was <i>Lampleigh v. Brathwait</i>, an authority decided just immediately after the Middle Ages. The common law of England had much developed since then and would rule against the sort of service provided by <i>Lampleigh</i> for a fee. <i>Lampleigh</i> was not an authority on public policy. David Wong Hon Leong (supra), which applied <i>Lampleigh</i> to uphold the alleged illegal contract, was decided <i>per incuriam</i>, and now expressly overruled on the illegality point. (paras 71 &amp; 76)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was contrary to Malaysian public policy that a person be hired for money or valuable consideration to use his position and interest to procure a benefit from the Government, as the sale of influence engendered corruption and undermined public confidence in the Government, which was inimical to public interest. (para 75)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The RM20m was intended as payment for services rendered by the respondent to secure the project. The respondent pleaded that he used his influence and good relationship with the Government of Malaysia to procure the project for the benefit and interest of the 1st appellant. The respondent particularised his close relationship with named Federal Ministers and his dealings with Federal Ministers with respect to the project. The respondent had in fact admitted to influence peddling and provided details of his influence and the manner in which he exerted his influence and convinced the Federal Ministers. On the facts and on the face of it, it was very plain and obvious that the consideration was unlawful, and that the letter of undertaking was void. (para 78)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The award and project were intrinsically linked. There could not be one without the other. When the project was withdrawn, which fact was not disputed, the award came to nought. The award was automatically retracted. The reasoning that the award was separable from the project ran counter to all intuitive and reasonable construction of the letter of undertaking. The RM20m was the consideration for the services rendered to procure the project and not just a document. When the project was withdrawn, the RM20m was not payable, but if paid, the letter of undertaking provided that it should be returned. (para 79)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The question upon which leave was granted to appeal against the order of the Court of Appeal in respect of the matter decided by the High Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The background facts could be summarised as follows. Evidently, there was a plan by the Government of Malaysia for a bridge to replace the Johore- Singapore causeway (hereinafter referred to as the bridge project), and that the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's Department, by its letter dated 25 June 1998, awarded, in principle, the execution of the bridge project to one Suria Kalbu Sdn Bhd in which the 2nd appellant had an equity of 60%. Hitherto, the appellants had requested the respondent "to render his services to procure and secure the award" of the execution of the project from the Government of Malaysia", for which services the appellants had agreed to pay RM20 million to the respondent. Those "facts" appeared in the following letter of undertaking dated 3 July 1998 of the 1st appellant to the respondent, which was countersigned by the respondent in agreement.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The pleaded defence of the 1st appellant was two-pronged. First, the 1st appellant pleaded that the asserted procurement of the bridge project on account of the respondent's close relationship with the Government of Malaysia and Dato' Seri Megat Junid was against public policy and that the said letter of undertaking was illegal and void. Then again, the 1st appellant also pleaded that the respondent had not secured any project from the Government of Malaysia for the 1st appellant, that on 11 August 2003, the bridge project, which was redesigned, was awarded to one Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd, that on 12 April 2006, the Government of Malaysia wholly scrapped the bridge project, and that the letter of undertaking could not be put into effect as the bridge project had not materialised. Suffice it to say that the pleaded defence of the 2nd appellant was not materially different from that of the 1st appellant. The pleaded reply of the respondent was that the letter of undertaking was not contrary to public policy, that the bridge project was awarded to Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd on account of the endeavour of the respondent, and that the appellants had directly or indirectly enjoyed the benefit of the compensation that was paid pursuant to the cancellation of the bridge project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> There were hardly any agreed facts to speak of when trial commenced (see p 237 of the Appeal Record). But still much were admitted by both sides. <i>Inter alia</i>, the respondent admitted (see 239-242AR) (i) that on 11 August 2003, the Public Works Department issued a letter of acceptance to Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd for the design, construction, completion and commissioning of the [redesigned] bridge project for a contract sum of RM1.113 billion, (ii) that on 5 February 2003, the Public Works Department instructed Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd to stop work on the bridge project, and, (iii) that on 12 April 2006, the Public Works Department "issued a letter to Gerbang Perdana for [the] mutual termination of the bridge project contract". And <i>inter alia</i>, the appellants admitted (see 243-245AR) (i) that "the letter of undertaking dated 3 July 1998 was signed by the 2nd [appellant] on behalf of the 1st [appellant]", and, (ii) that with respect to the bridge project, a joint venture and shareholders agreement dated 11 November 1998 was entered into between the 1st appellant, Diversified Resources Berhad, Detik Nagasari Sdn Bhd and Gerbang Perdana Sdn Bhd. There were differences in the respective dates, but it was nonetheless common ground that the letter of undertaking dated 3 July 1998 was given by the appellants to the respondent, and that the bridge project was scrapped by the Government of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The trial court held that "the main legal issue raised [by the appellants] was whether the consideration ... was opposed to public policy, illegal and therefore unenforceable pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>" (Act), which said <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Act</LINK> read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> At p 13 of its grounds of judgment (see 32AR), the trial court held that it would not be necessary to consider the other pleaded defences of the appellants if it were to be held that "the consideration ... was opposed to public policy, illegal and consequently, unenforceable as being void ...".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> And in relation to the issue of whether the consideration was opposed to public policy, the trial court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The trial court also gave or rather repeated the following reasons (see 46- 56AR) for its finding that the 'services' rendered by the respondent was not opposed to public policy: (i) mere close relationship with government leaders and assistance rendered to procure the project through the influence of the [respondent] are not per se opposed to public policy unless the consideration and object is inimical or tainted with illegality as envisaged by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e)</LINK>, (ii) the services were rendered in a transparent fashion, (iii) the object of the [respondent] and or the consideration were not tainted with illegality and or opposed to public policy, (iv) the court would not reject the [respondent's] claim solely on a bare assertion that the letter of undertaking was opposed to public policy, (v) to carry out its obligations, the [respondent] had not used any illegal means that were harmful to public welfare, (vi) there was no evidence of any abuse of influence, any influence peddling, any corrupt practice, any corrupt gratification to governmental officials or Ministers, (vii) there was no evidence that the [respondent] was being used as an intermediary to tout for the applicants of government contracts, (viii) there were insufficient facts for a finding that the payment of RM20m was opposed to public policy and or public welfare and interest, and (ix) the bridge project was for the good of the people.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On the effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e)</LINK>, the trial court held that a contract would not be enforced "only if the court regard the consideration or object as illegal, as being opposed to public policy", and that "until the court regard the consideration or object as unlawful and void, the presumption must necessarily be that the consideration or the object is lawful and the contract is enforceable unless and until it is rebutted" (see p 60AR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> At the end of a lengthy discourse on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e) of the Act</LINK> which made up more than the greater part of its grounds, the trial court held that the letter of undertaking was enforceable against both appellants. But then against the grain of that latter finding, the trial court concluded, in just a matter of a few short paragraphs (see 70-72AR), that the bridge project was withdrawn or terminated and "did not materialise", and that, pursuant to terms of the letter of undertaking, the respondent was not entitled to payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The trial court rejected the argument that it was the project and not the award that was withdrawn.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> But that argument that there was a difference between "award" and "project" was wholly accepted by the Court of Appeal which held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the following particulars in the letter of undertaking, namely, (i) the acknowledgement that the bridge project was awarded to the appellants through the endeavour of the respondent, (ii) the date of the letter of undertaking being 3 July 1998, and, (iii) the date for payment of the said RM20m being 3 November 1998, "show conclusively that the parties never intended to refer to the project itself. If they did they would not have specified the payment date a mere four months from the date of the letter of undertaking. In any event, if their intention was to refer to the project itself then that could have been achieved by employment of the following words - 'this letter of undertaking shall become invalid if and when the project is terminated for whatever reason' " (see 83AR). The final remark of the Court of Appeal was that "the learned judge erred when he took into account the 2006 termination. On that note, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and accordingly ordered the appellants to pay the said RM20m to the respondent.</p>

      <b>[15]</b> Whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e) of the Act</LINK> was raised in argument at the intermediate appeal was not revealed in the grounds of judgment of the Court of Appeal.

      <b>[26]</b> Therefore, "the question of illegality would not depend on pleading or procedure, or on who first might or should produce the documents.

Unus Shipping Co Ltd (in Liquidation)</i> [1939] 1 All ER 513 per Lord Wright). "... when an allegation of illegality is made, and a suggestion is made to the court that the contract is illegal, notwithstanding the fact that the illegality is not pleaded, the court is bound to take cognisance of the fact that the contract may be illegal, and, if it is illegal, the court cannot enforce it" (<i>Marles v. Philip Trant &amp; Sons Ltd (Mackinnon, Third Party) (No 1)</i> [1953] 1 All ER 645 per Lynskey J). "A judge is constrained to decide those issues raised by the pleadings in an action. The judge cannot decide issues not contained in the pleading because the judge has jurisdiction only to deal with those matters that the parties have chosen to bring before him in their pleadings. This rule is subject to exceptions where there is a public interest and the judge on his own initiative considers a matter of which he has become aware during the course of a case, although it is not contained in the pleadings, for example, cases of illegality or of conduct contrary to public policy" (<i>Swann, Evans, Ferguson and Crawshay (a firm) v.

An illustration is a simple statement of facts to which the section itself has got to be applied. It only exemplifies the law as enacted in a statute ... The statement of law in the illustrations used in an Act cannot be taken as laying down substantive law, and does not bind the court to place a meaning on the section which is inconsistent with its language.

      <b>[43]</b> The second component of the leave question is "the provision of services for a consideration to influence the decision of a public decision maker to award a contract". It is crucial to recognise the 'service' for what it was.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In <i>R v. O'Brien</i> [2009] OJ No 5817, it was alleged that Larry O'Brien, the then Mayor of Ottawa, committed an offence contrary to s 121(1)(d) of the Criminal Code of Canada which provided that "Every one commits an offence who having or pretending to have influence with the government or with a minister of the Government or an official, directly or indirectly demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept, for themselves or another person, a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in connection the transaction of business with or any matter of business relating to the Government or a claim against Her Majesty or any benefit that Her Majesty is authorised or is entitled to bestow, whether or not, in fact, the official is able to cooperate, render assistance, exercise influence or do or omit to do what is proposed, as the case may be". The Crown submitted "that the activity in issue in this case harms public confidence in the integrity of the public appointment process, a process that must be conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner". JD Cunningham ACJSCJ agreed.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> There is no provision for a similar offence in the local jurisdiction. But <i>R v. O'Brien</i> shows that the sort of activity as stated in the said s 121(1)(d) was labelled as influence peddling. Indeed, in <i>R v. Cleary</i> [1992] NSJ No 355, the court openly said that an offence under the said s 121(1)(d) was influence peddling. Incidentally, in <i>Law Society of Saskatchewan v. Robertson Stromberg</i> [1996] SJ No 558, and in <i>Gilbert and Murray</i> [1994] CPSSRB, it was held that s 121 of the Criminal Code of Canada includes the offence commonly known as influence peddling.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Canada is not the only jurisdiction to label that sort of activity as stated in the said s 121(1)(d) as influence peddling. In <i>Tekron Resources Ltd v. Guinea Investment Co Ltd</i> [2003] EWHC 2577 (QB), the claimant had acted as an intermediary between a company and the government of Guinea. The claimant claimed for fees allegedly due. The defendant argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that officers of the claimant had stated that they had a 'special relationship' with the Government of Guinea; that under the terms of the representative agreement, the claimant had agreed to use its influence and or relationship with the government and/or officials to obtain for the defendant an interest in bauxite concessions in Guinea; that such an agreement was illegal by the law of Guinea; and/or that the agreement was void as being contrary to public policy under English law. Under art 195 of the Guinean criminal law, it was an offence to procure official and/or governmental influence in exchange for payment. That article, which followed a provision of French law, read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Interestingly, the said art 195 was headed 'Trafic d'influence', which the court said could be translated as 'Trafficking of Influence' or 'influence peddling'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> On 'influence peddling', learned counsel for the appellant submitted that "the modern formulation of the public policy rule against influence peddling could be traced to" <i>Montefiore v. Menday Motor Components Company Ltd</i> [1918] 2 KB 241 and <i>Lemenda Trading Co Ltd v. African Middle East Petroleum Co Ltd</i> [1988] QB 448.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In <i>Montefiore</i>, the plaintiff was a member of the Imperial Air Fleet Committee who held out to the defendant that he could assist the defendant in getting finance from the Air Board. In return he was to obtain 10% of the amount received and some shares. The plaintiff was 'to put in a good word for' the defendant. The Government in the autumn of 1916 advanced to the defendant 2500/. The defendant paid the plaintiff 100/. The defendant thought all the while that the plaintiff was working in his interests and helping him to get the money which the plaintiff afterwards obtained from the Government. The plaintiff based his claim upon the allegation that his introduction and services caused the advance of money to be given by the Government to the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> On the facts, Shearman J said that "the true consideration for the giving of the note was that the plaintiff should use his alleged position, and the value of his good word, in favour of the defendants in getting Government assistance in the form of money or contracts".</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Shearman J then pronounced that it was contrary to public policy that a person should be hired for money or valuable consideration, when he had access to persons of influence, to use his position and interest to procure a benefit from the Government.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> In <i>Lemenda</i>, the defendants, a company registered in London, entered into a contract with the Qatar national oil company for the supply of crude oil. Under the law of Qatar a commission contract for the supply of oil by the national oil company was void and unenforceable, because it was contrary to Qatar public policy. The defendants later entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs, a company registered in Nassau, under which the plaintiffs agreed to assist the defendants in procuring the renewal of the supply contract by exerting influence on the chairman or managing director of the Qatar national oil company in return for a commission payable on any oil shipped under the renewed contract. The supply contract was renewed and the plaintiffs sought payment under the commission agreement. The defendants refused to pay and the plaintiffs brought an action in England to recover the amount of the commission. The defendants conceded that the commission agreement was governed by English law, but contended that the agreement was unenforceable in England because it had been performed in a friendly foreign state, Qatar, where its performance was illegal. The plaintiffs contended that the agreement was not illegal under the law of Qatar but merely contrary to public policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Phillips J held that the public policy of a friendly foreign state could not of itself prevent the enforcement of a contract in England. Phillips J however held that an English court would not enforce a contract which was governed by English law but fell to be performed abroad if the contract related to a transaction which was contrary to English public policy founded on general principles of morality and the same public policy applied in the friendly foreign country where the contract was to be performed, which found support in <i>Westacre Investments Inc v. Jugoimport-SDRP Holding Co Ltd and Ors</i> [1999] 3 All ER 864, at p 877, where Waller LJ (Mantell LJ concurring) held that where a contract, though unenforceable for reasons of domestic public policy if performed in England, is to be performed abroad, it would be enforced by the English court unless it is also contrary to the domestic public policy of the country of performance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In his deliberation, Phillips J first summarised the law relating to English public policy.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> On the authority of those cases, Phillips J said that "it is possible to deduce the following principles underlying this head of public policy: (i) it is generally undesirable that a person in a position to use personal influence to obtain a benefit for another should make a financial charge for using such influence, particularly if his pecuniary interest will not be apparent; and (ii) it is undesirable for intermediaries to charge for using influence to obtain contracts or other benefits from persons in a public position."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> On the various heads of public policy that can invalidate contracts, Phillips J observed that in some cases it will be difficult to decide which head of public policy applies so as to render a contract unenforceable.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> Phillips J then went on to say that some heads of public policy are based on universal principles of morality and that when "a contract infringes such a rule of public policy the English court will not enforce it, whatever the proper law of the contract and wherever the place of performance":</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> But there should be no difficulty to place to which head of public policy applies to a contract for the sale of influence, for it is "a recognised head of English public policy that the court will not enforce a contract for the sale of influence, and particularly where the influence is to be used to obtain contracts or other benefits from persons in a public position: see <i>Norman v. Cole</i> [1800] 3 Esp 253, <i>Montefiore v. Menday Motor Components Company Ltd</i> [1918] 2 KB 241, <i>Lemenda (supra)</i> and <i>Tekron Resources Ltd v. Guinea Investment Co Ltd</i> [2003] EWHC 2577" (<i>Marlwood Commercial Inc v. Kozeny and Others; Omega Group Holdings Ltd and others v. Kozeny and Others</i> [2006] EWHC 872 per Jonathan Hirst QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court). The "... public policy ... is that against the upholding of corrupt practices including influence peddling: see <i>Montefiore</i> and <i>Lemenda</i>" (R v. V [2008] EWHC 1531 per David Steel J).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> But that latter head of public policy is only against the sale of influence and not against influence per se. That was distinguished in <i>Tekron</i>, where it was argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that officers of the claimant had stated that they had a 'special relationship' with the Government of Guinea; that under the terms of the representation agreement, the claimant had agreed to use its influence and or relationship with the Government and/or officials to obtain for the defendant an interest in bauxite concessions in Guinea; that such an agreement was illegal by the law of Guinea, namely the said art 195 of the Guinean Criminal Code and/or that the agreement was void as being contrary to public policy under English law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Jack J held that the representation agreement involved no breach of art 195 of the Guinean Criminal Code and was not contrary to English public policy. But more importantly, in answering the submission of the defence, Jack J underscored the important distinction between sale of influence and position of influence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> But the distinction between what is and what is not the sale of influence may not be obvious at times, as seem to have been the case in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_708;"><i>David Wong Hon Leong v. Noorazman Adnan</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 708</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 283; [1995] 4 CLJ 155; [1996] 1 AMR 007, and in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_4_773;"><i>Ahmad Zaini Japar v.

    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In <i>David Wong Hon Leong</i>, the appellant sought the assistance of the respondent, who said he knew the Menteri Besar of Selangor, to expedite the conversion and sub-division of his company's lands, for its development into a housing estate. The appellant agreed to pay a fee of RM268,888 ('the fee') for the respondent's services. Later, the appellant also agreed to pay an additional fee of RM100,000 for the respondent's assistance to obtain a right of way over an adjoining land. The respondent wrote a letter using the company's letterhead to the Menteri Besar, asking for assistance for an early approval of the application. The appellant paid RM100,000 to the respondent when he produced the letter with the handwritten word 'Disokong' addressed to the land administrator and signed by the Menteri Besar. Later, the land administrator informed the company that its application had been approved. The required right of way was eventually obtained. However, the appellant refused to pay the remaining fee of RM168,888 and the additional fee of RM100,000. The respondent applied for summary judgment. The appellant argued in his defence, <i>inter alia</i>, that: (i) there was no consideration for the alleged agreement; (ii) the respondent did nothing to earn his fee; and (iii) the agreement was void for illegality as the approval had already been granted at that point in time and the money was in fact a bribe. The judge rejected all the appellant's defences for not amounting to <i>bona fide</i> triable issues, entered judgment for the sum of RM168,888, and granted unconditional leave to the appellant to defend in respect of the additional fee of RM100,000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the appellant reagitated three issues raised before the trial court, namely "(i) the plaintiff told the defendant that he knew the Menteri Besar of Selangor, some exco members and some government officers and he was promised that he could expedite the conversion of the property. That would be illegal under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">ss 24</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;25.;;">25 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK>; (ii) he did nothing, therefore there was no consideration, and, (iii) they took this big sum of money and did nothing". On issues (ii) and (iii) which were related to the consideration, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The position of the respondent before us is, at the very least, not dissimilar from that of the successful plaintiff in <i>Lampleigh v. Brathwait</i> [1615] Hob 105, who, in order to obtain a pardon for the defendant, Brathwait, at the latter's request, exerted himself 'riding and journeying to and from London and Newmarket' at his own expense. Brathwait later promised to pay him £100 for his trouble, but failed to do so. Lampleigh sued in assumpsit and succeeded on the ground that his services had been rendered at the previous request. If Lampleigh could recover for his exertions, it is a little difficult to understand why the instant respondent should not."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> On illegality, it was submitted that the appellant was deceived into believing that approval would be granted when in fact it had already been granted and that the money paid to the respondent and what remained due were in fact a bribe to corruptly obtain support from the Menteri Besar and other state officials for the company's application. The Court of Appeal held that there was no deception, as "it was not a case where by means of a false representation, the respondent obtained a pecuniary advantage from the appellant or even the company", that the appellant "asked for help", the respondent agreed "but asked for a fee", that the respondent "deliver the goods and received part payment", and that "the appellant is a man who is prepared to make unfounded allegations at the drop of a hat". As for the allegation of bribery, the Court of Appeal held that it was not substantiated. The appeal was dismissed without any consideration of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Act</LINK> or a single case that pertained to illegality on the ground of public policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In <i>Ahmad Zaini Japar</i>, the plaintiff was requested by the defendant to provide advisory services and assistance and to negotiate with several agencies for the purpose of procuring a contract for the defendant with Petronas Carigali. As consideration, the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff an amount equivalent to 1% of the contract value, subject to a limit of RM12m. The plaintiff rendered the advisory services and succeeded in securing for the defendant a contract valued at RM2.1 billion. The defendant paid RM700,000 to the plaintiff for the services rendered. The plaintiff sued the defendant when the defendant failed to pay the outstanding sum. The plaintiff sought to enter summary judgment against the defendant who applied to strike out the plaintiff's claim. The deputy registrar entered summary judgment against the defendant and dismissed the defendant's application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> On appeal to Judge-in-Chambers, the defendant argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that the plaintiff's activity was illegal as the plaintiff, being a third party, was able to influence the private and internal machinery of a national oil company in the award of a multi-million ringgit contract irrespective of more competitive and deserving bidders. But from the report of the grounds of judgment, it would appear that the illegality point on the ground of public policy was only taken up by the defendant after it was argued that the agreement did not exist, was <i>ultra vires</i>, and or was in contravention of company law or some other statute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> At p 834 of the report, the court revealed that "the defendant referred to the statement of claim and then submitted that the plaintiff purported to provide: (a) advisory service, and to render (b) assistance by using (c) his skill, (d) knowledge, and (e) endeavours, by holding or having discussions as well as negotiations with both the government and non-governmental bodies, agencies and authorities in order to obtain the Petronas Carigali contract for the defendant. The defendant posed the questions "as to what kind of advisory service the plaintiff provided in order to enable the defendant to secure the Petronas Carigali contract" as to whether the plaintiff was a qualified and trained petroleum engineer, and as to whether the plaintiff was a trained petro-chemical expert or an oil and gas expert or a professional who provides such technical petroleum advice, to which questions the defendant answered that on the balance of probabilities the plaintiff could not provide such advice because the defendant, being an oil and gas company, had employees with that sort of expertise. In effect, the defendant contended that the expertise of the plaintiff could not be technical. The defendant further argued that "Whoever he may be or whatever position he holds in society he must certainly have a strong influence with the government and non-governmental bodies, agencies and/ or authorities otherwise he would not be able to help the defendant to obtain the contract with Petronas Carigali, and this must be the nagging question that remains in the 'mind' of the defendant". To all that, the answer of the plaintiff was that he "expended his exertions in securing the Petronas Carigali contract for the defendant ... obtained the assistance of the treasury by marketing the defendant in order to successfully bid for the Petronas Carigali contract".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> However, the court held that illegality on the ground of public policy was not particularised and also not proved. The court ruled that the agreement "was perfectly within the domain of the Contracts Act 1950 and I do not propose to add anything more". On <i>Montefiore</i> which was specifically cited, the court held that "<i>Montefiore</i> was decided in 1915 while the case of <i>Wong Hon Leong</i> was decided in September 1995 against the background of our <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;;">Contracts Act 1950</LINK> particularly <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">ss 2(d) and 2(e)</LINK> thereto". Pertinently, the court remarked that the defendant in <i>David Wong Hon Leong</i> had used his influence to secure the subdivision of the land.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> But with the utmost of respect to both courts, it was entirely wrong to deal with the allegation of illegality by reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>. A contract may be good under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> but yet bad under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Act</LINK>. It was entirely wrong in law to uphold an illegal contract from the aspect and on the basis of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>. If it were to be decided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>, then <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Act</LINK> and its purpose to render void the stated unlawful consideration and unlawful objects, would be rendered effete and meaningless, such as if had no use at all.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> As said, whenever the illegality of a contract is raised or become apparent, it is the duty of the court to take it up, by reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24 of the Act</LINK>. In <i>David Wong Hon Leong</i>, the allegation of illegality should have been considered by reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">s 24(e) of the Act</LINK> and the pertinent case law. But unfortunately, not a single authority on illegality on the ground of public policy was considered in <i>David Wong Hon Leong</i>. Instead, only <i>Lampleigh</i>, an authority on past consideration in assumpsit that was decided just immediately after the Middle Ages, was relied on to rule against illegality. With respect, the Common Law of England has so developed that it would rule against the sort of service provided by <i>Lampleigh</i> for a fee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> Since <i>Norman v. Cole</i> [1800] 3 Esp 253, "assumpsit will not lie to recover money deposited for the purpose of being paid to a person in his interest in soliciting a pardon for a person under a sentence of death". The action was brought to recover a sum of £30 which the plaintiff had deposited in the hands of the defendant upon terms that it would be applied to procure a pardon for one Tunstall who was under the sentence of death. On the case being opened, Lord Eldon expressed doubt as to whether the action was maintainable. On being asked to show upon what grounds they founded their right to recover, counsel for the plaintiff stated that Tunstall was a man of good character before his conviction and that the money was to be paid to one Morland, "a person with good connexions and access to persons of interest ... so using his influence, by representing in favourable terms, the case and character of Tunstall". Lord Eldon held that the action was not maintainable:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Besides <i>Norman v. Cole</i>, Shearman J also relied on <i>Hopkins v. Preskott</i> [1847] 4 CB 578, 596, where Coltman J remarked that where a person undertakes for money to use his influence with the Commissioners of Taxes to procure for another party the right to sell stamps, &amp; c, if the contract were not void by statute [5 &amp; 6 Edw 6, c 16], it would be void at common law as contrary to public policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> By the first half of the 19th century, that is, well before <i>Montefiore</i>, there was already case law that pronounced that it was contrary to public policy that a person should be hired for money or valuable consideration, to use his position and interest to procure a benefit from the Government. Thereafter, that Common Law only became entrenched. In <i>Elliot v. Richardson and Ors</i> [1870] 5 LR 744, A and B were two shareholders of a company then being compulsorily wound up. B was also a creditor of the company. An agreement was entered into between them, by which A agreed to use his influence to obtain the postponement of a call then about to be made, and to support B's claim, and B, in consideration thereof agreed to pay all calls made on A's shares. The agreement was held as contrary to the policy of the Winding-up Acts and therefore void. Only then came <i>Montefiore, Parkinson v. College of Ambulance Ltd</i> [1925] 2 KB 1 where it was held that a contract to procure a honour was unenforceable, and <i>Lemenda</i> where it was held that it is generally undesirable that a person in a position to use personal influence to obtain a benefit for another should make a financial charge for using such influence, particularly if his pecuniary interest will not be apparent and that it is undesirable for intermediaries to charge for using influence to obtain contracts or other benefits from persons in a public position.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;24.;;">Section 24</LINK> is a codification of the English Common Law. Therefore, it is contrary to Malaysian public policy that a person be hired for money or valuable consideration, to use his position and interest to procure a benefit from the Government, as the sale of influence engenders corruption and undermines public confidence in the government, which is inimical to public interest. It was preposterous to submit that "when the government officials themselves have no qualms of the widespread practice of awarding contracts or projects to their cronies then surely this practice is acceptable in Malaysia. And hence such agreement to use a person's good contacts and or standing with certain government officials in order procure contracts or projects cannot be against public policy in Malaysia" (see the respondent's further written submission dated 15 October 2014 at para 18).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> We digress to underscore that <i>Lampleigh</i> was not an authority on public policy. In the corollary, the case that applied <i>Lampleigh</i> to uphold the alleged illegal contract, namely <i>David Wong Hon Leong</i>, was decided <i>per incuriam</i>, and which, with respect, we now expressly overrule, on the illegality point.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> It is opportune to 'pigeon-hole' the service rendered by the respondent, and pronounce on the legality or otherwise of the letter of undertaking. The letter of undertaking stated (i) that the respondent, at the request of the appellant, had agreed "to render his services for the purpose of procuring and securing from the Government of Malaysia the award of the project known as 'Cadangan Pembinaan Jambatan Menggantikan Tambak Johor secara Penswastaan' in favour of the Consortium called Suria Kalbu Sdn Bhd ... in which the [appellant] has a 60% equity participation in the issued share capital", (ii) that "through the [respondent's] "services aforesaid the Unit Perancang Ekonomi Jabatan Perdana Menteri by letter dated 22 June 1998 has awarded in principle the project to the consortium", (iii) that "in consideration of the services aforesaid rendered by the [respondent] ... Merong Mahawangsa Sdn Bhd ... undertakes and agrees to pay [the respondent] the sum of Ringgit Malaysia Twenty Million only (RM20,000,000.00) being the agreed remuneration payable on or before 3rd November 1998" and (iv) that the undertaking "shall remain valid so long as the award for the project remains valid and subsisting and should the award be withdrawn and or terminated for any reasons whatsoever the aforesaid sum of RM20,000,000.00 or any part thereof shall be refunded without interest immediately".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> There could be no mistake about it, the RM20m was intended as payment for service rendered by the respondent to secure the bridge project for the Consortium. But what sort of service was rendered by the respondent? In the instant case, the answer was provided by the respondent. The respondent pleaded that he "used his influence and good relationship with the Government of Malaysia to procure the original bridge project (SIG project) for the benefit and interest of the [1st appellant]". In his amended statement of claim at 164-166 AR, the respondent particularised his close relationship with named Federal Ministers and his dealings with Federal Ministers with respect to the bridge project. But it was not in pleadings alone that influence peddling was admitted by the respondent. In his witness statement (see 564-580AR), the respondent affirmed his pleaded facts and even provided further details of his influence and the manner in which he exerted his influence and convinced those Federal Ministers (in particular, see 569-571AR. "An agreement, the object of which is to use the influence with the Ministers of government to obtain a favourable decision, is destructive of sound and good administration. It showed a tendency to corrupt or influence public servants to give favourable decisions otherwise than on their own merits. Such an agreement is contrary to public policy. It is immaterial, if the persons intended to be influenced are not amenable to such recommendations" (<i>Mulla Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts</i>, 13th edn vol 1 at pp 702-703). On the facts and on the face of it, it was so plain and obvious that the consideration was unlawful, and that the letter of undertaking was void. On that ground, the claim should have been dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> Given our finding that the letter of undertaking was contrary to public policy and therefore void and unenforceable, we need not deal with the issue of whether it was an award or contract that was withdrawn. But for completeness, let it not pass unsaid that the award and bridge project were intrinsically linked. There could not be one without the other. When the bridge project was withdrawn, which fact was not disputed, the award came to nought. When the bridge project was withdrawn, the award of the bridge project was automatically retracted. With respect, the reasoning that the 'award' was separable from the 'bridge project' ran counter to all intuitive as well as reasonable construction of the letter of undertaking. It was so self-evident that the RM20m was the consideration for the 'service' rendered to procure the bridge project and not just a document. In that connection, we agree with the trial court's finding that when the project bridge was withdrawn, the RM20m was not payable, but if paid, the letter of undertaking provided that it should be returned. With respect, that was about the only finding we could agree with the courts below, for we could not fathom how the illegal agreement could be upheld by the trial court or how illegality could pass without a word of comment by the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> For the above reasons, we (on 14 May 2015, Mohamed Apandi Ali FCJ, as he then was, now AG, agreed with the draft of this judgment) unanimously answer the leave question, surely obviously, in the affirmative, allow this appeal with costs, affirm, for different reasons, the order of the trial court and set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> We must add that this appeal concerns 'influence peddling' and we make no comment on the restitutionary rights of a party not in <i>pari delicto</i>, where the law is still in a flux state (see "<i>Reflections on the Law of Illegality</i>" by Lord Sumption dated 23 April 2012).</p>
