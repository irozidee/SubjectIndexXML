    <p>The appellants obtained leave to appeal on the following questions of law: (i) whether <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value and without notice obtained good title to land immediately upon registration of transfer under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the Land Ordinance (Sabah Cap 68) ('SLO')</LINK> and was therefore an indefeasible registered interest in land; and (ii) whether the concept of deferred indefeasibility as adopted in <i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors</i>, a case based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the National Land Code ('NLC')</LINK>, should be distinguished from the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK>. The High Court and the Court of Appeal ruled that the title of the appellants to a piece of land was defeasible as the power of attorney used for the transfer of the land to the appellants was forged despite the land being registered in the appellants' names.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">Section 88 of the SLO</LINK> did not incorporate the concept of indefeasibility of title as found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>. A plain reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88</LINK> showed that there existed a lacuna in that provision when compared to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340</LINK>, which embodied the concept of indefeasibility of title. Registration under the SLO did not confer deferred or immediate indefeasibility of title. In the absence of statutory intervention in the like of the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3) of the NLC</LINK>, there was no protection afforded to the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice like the appellants. Therefore, this court differed from the view expressed by Richard Malanjum J (as he then was) in <i>Ngui Yu Thau v. Wong Mu Khyun &amp; Ors (No 2)</i> that in Sabah the principle enunciated by the Federal Court in <i>Boonsoom Boonyanit v. Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd</i> applied notwithstanding the lacuna in the SLO. (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">Section 88 of the SLO</LINK> must be considered on its own without being unnecessarily influenced by the provisions of the NLC because they were poles apart. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">Section 88</LINK> merely dealt with the registration of new title, dealing with claim to or interest in any land, other than land held under native customary tenure without documentary title. It required such title or dealing, etc to be registered for it to be valid under the SLO. It did not deal with the issue of defeasibility or indefeasibility of title as contained in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The fact that the names of the appellants found their way into the register of title did not automatically confer on the appellants an indefeasible title. It was open to enquiry as to how the appellants got themselves registered as owners of the land. The courts below came to the conclusion that the appellants could not get valid title to the land on the ground that the power of attorney used as authority to transfer the land was a forgery. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The instrument of transfer was an invalid or void instrument of transfer as it was executed on the authority of a forged power of attorney. Therefore, it could not give rise to a valid title in law. The SLO did not seek to give validity to such a title even though the appellants were <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice. There was nothing in the SLO giving protection to such purchasers. Such statutory protection must be expressly provided in the SLO. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The <i>nemo dat quod non habet</i> rule ('<i>nemo dat</i> rule') which means "no-one can transfer what he has not got" was applicable in the present case. The nemo dat rule protected the true owner of the goods. The innocent purchaser who purchased the goods from the non-owner acquired no title as the non-owner could not pass good title having had none. The right of the true owner was retained in the event his possession was stolen or sold to the unsuspecting purchaser. One of the exceptions to the <i>nemo dat</i> rule was when the innocent purchaser pleaded estoppel by asserting that the statement and conduct of the true owner led him to believe that the unauthorized seller had the right to sell the goods. Here, however, the forgers could not pass good title to the appellants. A mere claim of being a bona fide purchaser for value without notice was insufficient to avoid the application of the <i>nemo dat</i> rule which rendered the appellants' title to the land liable to be set aside at the instance of the respondents who were the rightful owners. The first question was therefore answered in the negative. (paras 34-36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">Section 340 of the NLC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK> were two distinct provisions. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">Section 88</LINK> only made provision in regard to registration of title. It did not incorporate the concept of indefeasibility as found under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>. The appellants were the immediate holders of the title obtained under a forged instrument of transfer. Therefore, their title was open to challenge and liable to be set aside at the instance of the respondents who were the true owners. It was erroneous to interpret <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88</LINK> as to confer upon bona fide purchasers for value without notice an indefeasible title or interest in the land upon registration. The answer to the second question was therefore in the affirmative. (paras 37-38)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Arifin Zakaria CJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellants (the defendants in the High Court) against the decision of the Court of Appeal in affirming the decision of the High Court. The Court of Appeal ruled that the title of the appellants is defeasible on the basis that the Power of Attorney that was used as authority to transfer the said land to the appellants is a forged instrument even though the land in question had been registered in the name of the appellants. That being the case, the Court of Appeal held that the appellants could not have acquired a valid title to the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Leave To Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This court had, on 5 December 2012, granted leave to the appellants to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The background facts of the case are these. The respondents (plaintiffs in the High Court) were the registered owners of a piece of land held under CL015029213 measuring 25 acres located in the district of Menggatal, Kota Kinabalu (hereinafter referred to as "the land"). The custody of the title deed of the land was with the 2nd respondent (now deceased) until it was given to the 7th respondent allegedly for valuation purposes. It is not disputed that the 7th respondent had intended to sell the land and for that purpose he informed one Tong Chung Hing (Tong) that he may be agreeable to a sale price of RM2.53 million. Tong later informed the 7th respondent that a certain Mr Ling was interested to purchase the land for RM2.53 million and is willing to pay in cash after Mr Ling had seen the original title and had valued the land. Upon the request of Tong, the 7th respondent gave the title deed to the land to Mr Ling for valuation purposes but the title deed was never returned to the 7th respondent. It was discovered later that the appellants had become the registered owners by virtue of a sale and purchase agreement dated 19 March 2004 with the 7th respondent signing for himself and on behalf of the 1st to 6th respondents pursuant to a power of attorney which the 1st to 6th respondents had allegedly given to the 7th respondent. The respondents contended that their signatures in the sale and purchase agreement dated 12 February 2004, the power of attorney dated 19 March 2004, the memorandum of transfer dated 25 March 2004 and Form PDS 15 were forged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Proceedings In The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In their claim, the respondents asked for, among others: an order that the transfer of the land effected under the Memorandum of Transfer dated 25 March 2004 to the 1st to 4th appellants be set aside and annulled on the ground of forgery; an order directing the 5th defendant (the Assistant Collector of Land Revenue, Kota Kinabalu) to expunge from the register and records at the Central Land Office the registration of the transfer dated 25 March 2004 and any other dealings effected by the 1st to 4th appellants after 25 March 2004; and, a declaration that the respondents are the registered co-owner of the land on 25 March 2004.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In opposing the claim, the appellants averred that they were not aware of any forgery in relation to the transfer of the land effected under the Memorandum of Transfer dated 25 March 2004 and claimed that they were <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice. The appellants also filed a claim against the third party, ie a legal firm named Messrs Johari &amp; Zelika, for negligence in handling the sale and purchase of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> After a full trial, the learned High Court Judge allowed the respondents' claim and made an order in terms of the prayers as per the statement of claim dated 13 March 2006. The learned High Court Judge held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> However, it is also the finding of the High Court that the appellants were <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In dismissing the claim against the third party, the High Court Judge held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Proceedings In The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. In dismissing the appellants' appeal, the Court of Appeal made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It is pertinent to note that although the Court of Appeal agreed with the learned High Court Judge on the finding of facts that the power of attorney used as authority to transfer the land to the appellants was a forged instrument, it disagreed with the application of the concept of deferred indefeasibility to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the Sabah Land Ordinance (SLO)</LINK>. The Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> As regard the appellants' claim against the third party, the Court of Appeal agreed with the finding of the High Court and hence the appeal by the appellants was accordingly dismissed. This is not an issue before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Issues Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>"Whether <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value and without notice, obtained good title to land immediately upon registration of the transfer under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the Land Ordinance (Sabah Cap 68) ("Land Ordinance")</LINK> and is therefore an indefeasible registered interest in land?"</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellants' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants, as <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice, obtained good title to the land by way of registration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK>. It follows therefore, by reasons of registration of their interest in the land, the appellants had received an immediate indefeasible registered title in the land. By virtue of the registration of the appellants as the registered owners of the land, the respondents were divested of the title or ownership to the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was implored upon us that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK> should be interpreted according to the intention of Parliament to ensure justice and fairness to the appellants. The appellants argued that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88</LINK> in its plain meaning emphasizes on the importance of registration as the pre-condition for validity of any new title or claim to or interest in any land. It constitutes the basic concept of Torrens system in which title to or interest in land vests and divests upon registration. In support, the appellants relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_154;"><i>Borneo Housing Mortgage Finance Berhad v. Time Engineering Berhad</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 154</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 12; [1996] 2 CLJ 561; [1996] 2 AMR 1537.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On the effect of registration of the Torrens title, learned counsel for the appellants referred us to an Australian case of <i>Breskvar v. Wall</i> [1971] HCA 70 where Barwick CJ in delivering the judgment of the court observed: "The Torrens system of registered title of which the Act is a form is not a system of registration of title but a system of title by registration ... It is the title which registration itself has vested in the proprietor. Consequently, a registration which results from a void instrument is effective according to the terms of the registration. It matters not what the cause or reason for which the instrument is void."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that the Malaysian courts recognise the concept of immediate indefeasibility to the title upon registration and thus, giving the true meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK> and the spirit of Torrens system. He cited a High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2013_4_327;"><i>Tan Sri William Cheng Heng Jem &amp; Anor v. Tan Sri Ngan Ching Wen &amp; Ors</i> [2013] 4 MLRH 327</LINK>; [2013] 8 MLJ 417 where it was held that: "A primary registration of a first Torrens title upon alienation grants to the registered owner a title that is immediately indefeasible as expressly provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;92.;;">s 92 of the NLC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK>, and as judicially interpreted in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_154;"><i>Borneo Housing Mortgage Finance Berhad v. Time Engineering Berhad</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 154</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 12; [1996] 2 CLJ 561; [1996] 2 AMR 1537." The court further held that: "Hence in the case of the Sabah Land, the registration of the title in the Sabah Land in D8's name by the Sabah State Authority pursuant to the SLO under the relevant state leases vests conclusively in D8 the legal and beneficial ownership in the Sabah Land which is immediately indefeasible against the whole world."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It is further submitted that the rules of equity and good conscience offer the protection to the appellants being the <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice of their title against adversarial claim although the instrument used to give effect to the transfer was forged. He relied on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2003_2_249;"><i>Ngui Yu Thau v. Wong Mu Khyun &amp; Ors (No 2)</i> [2003] 2 MLRH 249</LINK>; [2003] 6 CLJ 273, where Richard Malanjum J (as His Lordship then was), observed that no one derives good title, right or interest from or through a forged instrument unless he satisfied the doctrine of <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value and without notice. It is contended that in the present case it is proven that the appellants are <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Respondents' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> For the respondents, it was contended that the SLO is not an absolute Torrens system but a modified Torrens system of land registration. The respondents submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK> does not incorporate the principle of indefeasibility either immediate or deferred, of title or interests in land, on registration. On the contrary, such provision on indefeasibility of title is expressly defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the National Land Code (NLC)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;31.;;">s 31 of the Sarawak Land Code</LINK>. In support, the respondents referred to the case of <i>Borneo Housing Mortgage Finance Berhad v. Time Engineering Berhad (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was further submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the NLC</LINK> defines purchaser as "persons or body who in good faith and for valuable consideration acquires title to or any interest in land". Further the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3) of the NLC</LINK> made special exception in regard to <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice. Both provisions are absent in the SLO. Thus, there is nothing under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK> to safeguard the interest of person who obtained title in good faith through a void instrument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The respondents contended that as the instrument to effect the transfer is void, it conveys no valid title or interest in the land to the appellants unless there is statutory intervention under the SLO like <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3) of the NLC</LINK>. In support, learned counsel for the respondents referred this court to the passage by Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as His Lordship then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_209;"><i>Boonsoom Boonyanit v. Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 209</LINK>; [1997] 2 MLJ 62; [1997] 3 CLJ 17; [1997] 2 AMR 1813, which was also referred to by both the courts below which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The respondents also relied on the Federal Court's case in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_1;"><i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 1; [2010] 2 CLJ 269, where this court ruled:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It was also the respondents' submission that the appellants' reliance on <i>Ngui Yu Thau v. Wong Mu Khyun &amp; Ors (No 2)</i> (supra) was erroneous in the context of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88</LINK> which does not provide for the concept of indefeasibility of title. If the appellants' argument is accepted, it would mean that any <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value who gets his name registered on the land register cannot be removed for any reason whatsoever even if the registration was obtained through a forged instrument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the concept of <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice only applies as an exception to the common law rule if the vendor has a defective title. In the present case, the vendor's title is not defective but the instrument of conveyance is defective. Thus, the respondents contended that the concept of <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice has no application in the present case. In support of his argument, learned counsel referred this court to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_688;"><i>M &amp; J Frozen Food Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Siland Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 688</LINK>; [1994] 1 MLJ 294; [1994] 2 CLJ 14; [1994] 1 AMR 137.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The respondents further submitted that even if the appellants were not involved in the act of forgery as claimed by the appellants, this will not in any way assist the appellants. The appellants, being the purchasers should have taken reasonable steps to make the necessary inquiry and to ensure that the instrument, ie power of attorney, relied upon by the appellants is valid and genuine. Thus, the appellants have themselves to blame and to bear the consequences arising from their own negligence. In his submission, learned counsel for the respondents stated that this is consistent with the legal maxim "caveat emptor" ("let the buyer beware").</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Finding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the present case it was a finding of fact by the High Court that the appellants were <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value and without notice. It was also the finding by the High Court that the instrument used to effect the transfer of the said land was forged. These findings of fact by the High Court were never challenged in the Court of Appeal. Thus, the question arises whether, the appellants, being a <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value and without notice can obtain a good title to the land upon registration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of SLO</LINK> notwithstanding the fact that instrument of transfer was forged. It should be noted that the law governing the administration of land in Sabah is different from the law applicable in Peninsular Malaysia. In Peninsular Malaysia, the relevant law is the NLC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The concept of indefeasibility of title is incorporated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>. The section reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> For better understanding of the concept of indefeasibility, the analytical framework of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of NLC</LINK> is discussed in brief. Section 340 introduced the concept of indefeasibility of title following the Torrens system. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">Section 340(1)</LINK> sets out the general principle that the proprietor in whose favour registration has been effected will obtain an indefeasible title to or interest in the land. In other words upon registration of a title, it confers an indefeasible title to the owner whose name is registered. It is a system that operates on the principle of "title by registration". By indefeasibility, it means, "the immunity from attack by adverse claim to the land or interest in respect of which he is registered, which a registered proprietor enjoys" (see <i>Frazer v. Walker</i> [1967] 1 All ER 649).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The indefeasibility of title or interest so acquired under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(1)</LINK>, however, is liable to be set aside under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)</LINK> where it has been obtained by, <i>inter alia</i>, fraud or forgery. Thus, based on the concept of conclusive proof of registration, anyone, including those who had successfully registered the land by unlawful means, their title could not also be defeated unless if it is shown that the transfer was tainted with fraud or forgery as provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)</LINK>. In the case of fraud, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)(a)</LINK> provides for the title or interest obtained to be defeasible where the proprietor or his agent is a party or privy to the fraud. In the case of forgery, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)(b)</LINK> provides for the title or interest so acquired by the proprietor or transferee immediately to the forgery to be defeasible and liable to be set aside. Thus, the title is subject to challenge and can be defeated although the proprietor or transferee acted in good faith in acquiring the title or interest. The section differentiates between title obtained through forgery or fraud. In the case of forgery, there is no requirement that the proprietor or transferee to be a party to the forgery but he must be a party or privy in the case of fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In the circumstances where the title or interest is subsequently transferred, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3)</LINK> provides that the subsequent proprietor or transferee will similarly obtained a defeasible title or interest. However, where the subsequent proprietor or transferee acts in good faith and gives valuable consideration for the title or interest in question, the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3)</LINK> confers protection on such a subsequent proprietor or transferee such that his title or interest will be indefeasible. In effect, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340</LINK> introduces what is called the concept of deferred indefeasibility (<i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors (supra)</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">Section 88 of the SLO</LINK> on the other hand does not incorporate the concept of indefeasibility of title as found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>. For ease of reference, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of SLO</LINK> is reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> From the plain reading of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK>, we find there exists a lacuna in this provision when compared with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK> which embodies the concept of indefeasibility of title. Registration under the SLO does not confer indefeasibility of title, deferred or immediate. We are of the view that in the absence of statutory intervention in the like of the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3</LINK>), there is no protection afforded to the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice such as the appellants in the present case. Therefore, with respect, we differ from the view expressed by Richard Malanjum J in <i>Ngui Yu Thau v. Wong Mu Khyun &amp; Ors (No 2) (supra)</i>, at p 260 where he stated: "Thus in Sabah with specific reference to land the principle as enunciated by the Federal Court in Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd (supra) applies notwithstanding the lacuna in the Ordinance. In other words no one derives good title, right or interest from or through a forged instrument unless he satisfied the doctrine of <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value and without notice".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We are of the view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK> must be considered on its own without being unnecessarily influenced by the provisions of the NLC because they are poles apart. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">Section 88 of the SLO</LINK> merely deals with the registration of new title, dealing with claim to or interest in any land, other than land held under native customary tenure without documentary title. It requires such title or dealing, etc to be registered for it to be valid under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;;">SLO</LINK>. In other words, it does not deal with the issue of defeasibility or indefeasibility of title as contained in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The fact that the names of the appellants found their way on the register of title does not automatically confer on the appellants an indefeasible title. In other words, it is open to enquiry as to how the appellants got themselves registered as owners of the land. That was precisely what the courts below did in the present case and came to the conclusion that the appellants could not get valid title to the land on the ground that the power of attorney which was used as authority to transfer the land was a forgery. In its judgment the Court of Appeal stated: "... in this case that the power of attorney that was used as authority to transfer the said land to the appellants is a forgery, we agree with the learned trial judge that the title of the appellants to the property is defeasible and that the appellants could not have acquired a valid title to the said land though the land has been registered in the name of the appellants."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We agree with the finding of the courts below that the instrument of transfer in the present case was an invalid or void instrument of transfer as it was executed on the authority of a forged power of attorney, therefore, it could not give rise to a valid title in law and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;;">SLO</LINK> does not seek to give validity to such a title even though the appellants were <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value without notice. There is nothing in the SLO giving protection to such purchasers. Such statutory protection must be expressly provided in the SLO (<i>Gibbs v. Messer</i> [1891] AC 248).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The above finding by the Court of Appeal found support in the common law rule of <i>Nemo Dat</i> Quod Non Habet (<i>nemo dat</i> rule in short). The <i>nemo dat</i> rule literally means "no-one can transfer what he has not got" (<i>Bishopsgate Motor Finance Corporation Ltd v. Transport Brakes Ltd</i> [1949] 1 KB 322 as per Denning LJ). This is sometimes called the "derivation" principle: the transferee's rights derived from those of the transferor. The <i>nemo dat</i> rule protects the true owner of the goods (right of ownership) and the innocent purchaser who purchases the goods from non-owner gets no title as the non-owner could not pass good title because he has none. In other words, the right of the true owner is retained in the event of his possession is being stolen or sold to the unsuspecting purchaser. In a typical case, the application of <i>nemo dat</i> rule involves the seller who does not own the goods has no right to sell them but nevertheless sells them to an innocent buyer. Because of the apparent harshness of the <i>nemo dat</i> rule (as it is an innocent buyer who is a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice stands to lose out), several exceptions to <i>nemo dat</i> rule were developed at common law and also have been added by statute (<LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;;">Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK>). One of the exceptions to <i>nemo dat</i> rule is when the innocent purchaser pleads estoppel by asserting that the statement and conducts of the true owner have led him to believe that the unauthorized seller in fact had the right to sell the goods (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_382;27.;;">s 27(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1957</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We are of the view that the <i>nemo dat</i> rule is equally applicable in the present case which involves the transfer of title under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK> (<i>M &amp; J Frozen Food Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Siland Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor (supra)</i>). Applying the <i>nemo dat </i>rule to the present case, we hold that the forgers could not pass good title to the appellants (<i>Boonsoom Boonyanit v. Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>). Thus, we conclude that a mere claim of being a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice is not sufficient to avoid the application of the nemo dat rule which renders the appellants' title to the land liable to be set aside at the instance of the respondents who are the rightful owners.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In the result, we affirm the finding of the Court of Appeal and the High Court that the appellants could not obtain a good title to the said land as it is defeasible and liable to be set aside on the ground that it was obtained under a void or invalid instrument of transfer. Thus, our answer to the first question is in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>"Whether the concept of deferred indefeasibility as adopted in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_1;"><i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 1; [2010] 2 CLJ 269, which was a case based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the National Land Code</LINK> should be distinguished from the interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the Land Ordinance</LINK> since there is no similar provision in the Land Ordinance?"</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Having discussed <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of the SLO</LINK>, it is clear that they are two distinct provisions. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">Section 88 of SLO</LINK> only makes provision in regard to registration of title. It does not incorporate the concept of indefeasibility as found under the NLC. In the present case, the appellants are the immediate holder of the title which was obtained by or under a forged instrument of transfer, therefore, their title is open to challenge and be set aside at the instance of the respondents who were the true owners. It is thus erroneous to interpret <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SABH_1930_068;88.;;">s 88 of SLO</LINK> as to confer upon <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without notice an indefeasible title or interest in the land upon registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> For the reasons given, our answer to the second question is in affirmative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Based on the above, we agree with the High Court as affirmed by the Court of Appeal that appellants' title must in the circumstances be set aside. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
