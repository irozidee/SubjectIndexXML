    <p>The appeal was proceeded with only one issue concerning <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">s 2 of the Public Authorities Protection Act 1948 ('PAPA')</LINK>. In the High Court, the respondents/ defendants had successfully struck out the writ and statement of claim of the appellants/plaintiffs on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that the claims and reliefs sought by the appellants/plaintiffs were barred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">s 2 of the PAPA</LINK> and/or Item 97 of the Schedule to the Limitation Ordinance (Sarawak) (Cap 49), and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code (Sarawak) (Cap 81) ('Land Code')</LINK>. The appellants/plaintiffs appealed to this court. The case for the respondents/defendants was that the Provisional Leases for Lot 48 and Lot 52 Bok Land District were issued under the Land Code by the Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Miri acting in accordance with such written law on 5 April 1988 and 28 September 1988 and that prior to that Timber Licence No T/0027 and Timber Licence No T/0072 had been issued for harvesting of trees without any objection or complaint from the appellants/plaintiffs or any of those whom they purportedly represented.</p>

      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants/plaintiffs appealed against the striking out of their writ of summons and statement of claim dated 29 December 1997 upon the application by summons in chambers dated 16 June 2011 (encl 50), by the 1st and 2nd respondents/3rd and 4th defendants upon the grounds that the appellants/plaintiffs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the commencement of hearing preliminary objection, notice of which was given on 18 June 2012 was raised that the appellants/plaintiffs have failed to serve upon the 1st and 2nd respondents the notice of appeal dated 11 August 2011, and to date no application had been made to extend the time to serve the notice of appeal upon the 1st and the 2nd respondents/defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs conceded he became aware on 14 June 2012, that he did not have evidence of service having been made and therefore unable to prove the notice had been served.</p>

    <p>
      <b>The Appeals</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It was agreed by the parties that Appeals Q-01(IM)-576-09-11 and Q-01(IM)-577-09-11 be heard together and the decision in Q-01(IM)-576-09-11 shall bind Q-01(IM)-577-09-11.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appeal was proceeded with one issue only concerning <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">s 2 of the Public Authorities Protection Act 1948 (Revised 1978) (Act 198)</LINK>. In the High Court, the respondents/defendants had, by summons in chambers dated 16 June 2011 (encl 50), successfully applied to strike out the appellants/plaintiffs writ on grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, that the claims and reliefs sought by the appellants/plaintiffs are barred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">s 2 of the Public Authorities Protection Act 1948</LINK> and/or Item 97 of the Schedule to the Limitation Ordinance (Cap 49) and/or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;202.;;">s 202 of the Land Code 1958 (Cap 81)</LINK>. The appellants/plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The case for the respondents/defendants was that the Provisional Leases for Lot 48 and Lot 52 Bok Land District were issued under the Land Code by the Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Miri acting in accordance with such written law on 5 April 1988 and 28 September 1988 and that prior to that Timber Licence No T/0027 and Timber Licence No T/0072 had been issued for harvesting of trees without any objection or complaint from the appellants/ plaintiffs or any of them or any of those whom they purportedly represent.

    <p>
      <b>[8]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">Section 2(a) of Act 198</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Before this court, the appellants/plaintiffs submitted that the High Court erred in holding that the plaintiffs' claims and the reliefs sought are barred by reason of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_198;2.;;">s 2 of the Public Authorities Protection Act 1948</LINK>. They rely upon the submission that the act of trespass claimed was subsisting and continuous as the date of the writ and statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_1_297;"><i>Director Of Forests, Sarawak &amp; Anor v. Balare Jabu &amp; Ors And Another Appeal</i> [2013] 1 MLRA 297</LINK>; [2012] 7 CLJ 685, the Federal Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The respondents/defendants sought to distinguish the above decision of the Federal Court on the ground that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It was submitted that there was no provision in the leases similar to the provision quoted at para [17].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The submission was in our view irrelevant, as the leases were between the State Government and the respective defendants to whom the leases were issued. The provision operates as a limitation to the lessor's responsibility from claims from the lessee, and the lessee takes the risk of liability where they trespass on lands the subject of an NCR claim. Indeed without a similar provision it implies to the lessee that there are no NCR claims.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> All these are however irrelevant to the natives who claim to hold the land under NCR. By the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> their rights to the land, as property rights are undertaken to be protected by the State of Sarawak as well as the Federation of Malaysia. These lands having been acquired through NCR to provide for their livelihood, it is no surprise that their support and allegiance to the State of Sarawak that sought to join the Federation of Malaysia was founded upon their NCR being protected under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. Thus, their protection is not solely from the laws of Sarawak but also from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Both the Government of the State of Sarawak and the Government of the Federation of Malaysia have a duty to protect their NCR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Property rights, to be given meaning, necessarily includes all rights associated with the property. It includes the right to enjoy it, to enjoy the benefit of it and all that is on, in and under it. Whether or not there is any clause as in paragraph [11] of <i>Director Of Forests, Sarawak &amp; Anor v. Balare Jabu &amp; Ors And Another Appeal (supra)</i> is irrelevant to the native whose land, held under NCR rights, is encroached or trespassed upon, or taken and leased to another even if that other is a native. We observe that in the lease all payments are to the State of Sarawak and not to the natives holding NCR to the land. That the pleaded case was a single act of granting of the lease which "extinguished" their NCR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The submissions made that the appellants'/plaintiffs' pleaded case, that the lease was in disregard of the appellants'/plaintiffs' rights, that the grant of the lease was unconstitutional and amounted to extinguishment of their NCR over their NCR land was of a single act served no other purpose than to seek to establish that time for the purposes of limitation began to run from the dates the leases were granted on 5 April 1988 and 28 September 1988 and that the actions filed in 1997 were time barred. It was submitted that the appellants'/ plaintiffs' claim was but a declaration sought to nullify the issue of the leases to the two companies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The submission is, in our view, without merit for the reason that it is trite that time begins to run from the time the cause of action accrues, and not the act the fact of which is one of the facts in support. Indeed in this case as correctly pleaded, the single act was the foundation for more than one cause of action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We observe, however, that the submissions made nothing at all of the obvious, that the lands to which the appellants'/plaintiffs' claim NCR were leased and not alienated. Conceivably, where it is established the appellants/ plaintiffs did in fact have acquired NCR, the State should have acquired the land from the appellants/plaintiffs before it could lease it out to a third party, or if the State erred in leasing it out, there is a continuing damage until the error is corrected and the lands returned to the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> At the time of the first Rajah in Sarawak, Justice Chapman and Justice Martin in New Zealand in <i>R v. Symonds</i> [1847] NZPCC 387 upheld the concept of native title subsisting notwithstanding the assumption of sovereignty by the Crown, and that the Crown is bound to respect it. That decision is consonant with the views of the first Rajah expressed in <i>"The Private Letters of Sir James Brooke, KCB, Rajah of Sarawak"</i> edited by John C Templer Esq, vol 1, chapter 1, where the editor explained at p 2 that he was reproducing a paper by Sir James Brooke written before the latter left England in 1838 which set out his objectives explicitly. Discussing protecting British interests in the Malay Archipelago, and decrying the Dutch approach, Sir James Brooke significantly wrote (see p 11):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Similar views were expressed in <i>In re The London and Whitaker Claims Act 1871</i> [1872] 2 NZCA 41.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Notwithstanding these cases, the attitude to native titles was to change when Chief Justice James Prendegast was appointed in New Zealand in 1875. In <i>Wi Parata v. The Bishop of Wellington</i> [1877] 3 NZ Jur (NS) SC 72, Justice Prendergast transformed the position of aboriginal title from one subsisting at law, to one held on sufferance of the Crown.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> That view was rejected in <i>New Zealand Maori Council v. Attorney-General</i> [1987] 1 NZLR 641, commonly known as the "Lands Case". Discussing the common law approach to native rights to land, Justice Richardson said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Although there is no treaty by the first Rajah in Sarawak, it is noted that the first order affecting land was made by the second Rajah by the Rajah's Order of 1875. In our view, in the light of the Lands Case and <i>Mabo v. Queensland (No 2)</i> [1992] 175 CLR 1 the interpretation of the effect of assumption of sovereignty expressed in <i>Wi Purata v. The Bishop of Wellington (supra)</i> in the second half of 1870's no longer has a place in the common law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> That being the case, and in the light of the protection under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>, the rights to land acquired under NCR are such as according to the law and the time it was acquired, without diminution as to its scope and extent by subsequent legislation without adequate compensation. Extinguishment does not arise as common law no longer recognises NCR land held on sufferance, and if extinguishment is applied it would be contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13</LINK> if without adequate compensation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> From time to time we find submissions that a fact or issue is not pleaded. It is important to appreciate that the rule of pleadings is to expedite the judicial resolution of a case. Thus the law need not be pleaded, but the cause of action and the facts in support must be pleaded. This is for the reason that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> But it is clearly never intended that style of pleading or failure to plead should become "stumbling blocks" standing in the way of justice. The rules of procedure is not intended to provide blinkers to prevent the courts from seeing its way to a fair and just decision. This is evident from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;15.;;">O 15 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> that pleadings may be amended at any time before judgement is delivered, and that the amendment may be made on the motion of the court. Even if a fact has not been pleaded, a finding may be made thereon if the facts relevant thereto has been admitted into evidence before the court. The fundamental rule is that a court makes its decision based upon the application of law to the facts and evidence before it and no other.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Thus if an objection of "not pleaded" is to be successful, the party raising that objection must demonstrate that the failure to disclose the fact in the pleadings denied that party an opportunity to check and verify that fact, thereby rendering it unsafe to rely upon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Considering the pleadings as a whole and bearing in mind that the pleadings could still be amended if necessary, we find no reason to strike out the writs and statement of claim on this ground also.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
