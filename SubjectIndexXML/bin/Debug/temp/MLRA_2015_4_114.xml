    <p>The appellant sold some land pursuant to two agreements dated 14 August 2000 that were subject to several pre-conditions. Through supplemental agreements dated 14 February 2003, the sale and purchase price for the land was reduced. The pre-conditions were satisfied by 27 April 2007 and the appellant submitted its Notice of Taxation 2000 and Additional Notice of Taxation 2000 to the respondent. Both Notices were dated 31 December 2008. The appellant was dissatisfied with the assessment by the respondent and appealed to the Special Commissioner of Income Tax ('SCIT'). The SCIT decided in favour of the appellant. The respondent appealed to the High Court which allowed the appeal with costs. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In this case, the amount of consideration at the time the conditions were satisfied by 27 April 2007 was no longer the consideration price set out in the original agreements dated 14 August 2000, but the consideration as amended and set out in the supplemental agreements dated 14 February 2003. By the time the Notice of Assessment for YA 2000 dated 31 December 2008 was issued, the actual consideration price was the consideration price under the supplemental agreements. The price set out in the original agreements had by then become history. In other words, the Notice of Assessment for YA 2000 dated 31 December 2008 was based upon a fiction. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;16.;;">para 16(a) and (b)</LINK> of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;2.;;">Schedule 2 of the Real Property Gains Tax Act 1976 ('Act')</LINK>, the appellant was clearly entitled to the exemption under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2007_146;;">Real Property Gains Tax (Exemption) (No 2) Order 2007 PU(A) 146</LINK> dated 27 March 2007 and gazetted 1 April 2001. The exemption remained in force until 31 December 2009. (paras 14-15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Excepting only the case of any form of fraud or wilful default, there is a limitation of five years after the end of that year of assessment to make an additional assessment. The five-year limitation applies to assessments determined by the court on an appeal or review, even when the determination by the court is outside the control of the LHDN. Therefore, although the date by which the conditions were complied with is outside the control of the LHDN, for that matter, the five-year limitation would similarly remain applicable. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;15.;;">Section 15 of the Act</LINK> warrants review, but until that is done and amendments made, the law as it stands places a five-year limitation, and accordingly the assessment by Notice of Assessment for YA 2000 dated 31 December 2008 and served on 2 February 2009 was statute-barred by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;15.;;">s 15(1) of the Act</LINK>. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The appeal to the High Court was predicated upon a case stated by the SCIT. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;39.;;">Paragraph 39</LINK> of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;5.;;">Schedule 5 of the Income Tax Act 1967</LINK> was specific that the High Court is limited to questions of law arising from the case stated. The respondent was bound by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;39.;;">para 39</LINK>. Examination of the case stated by the SCIT showed a meticulous presentation of the facts, the evidence, the submissions, the relevant law and reasoning of the SCIT. It demonstrated a thorough appreciation and consideration of the facts. It did not betray <i>ex facie</i> any error on any question of law as to warrant appellate intervention. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The High Court's grounds of judgment clearly did not demonstrate with reasoning any error on the part of the SCIT in the case stated. Unless it was demonstrated that the SCIT had erred on a question of law, resulting in a manifest error in the deciding order, the court could not intervene, as it would amount to interference contrary to the intent of legislation in setting up and empowering the SCIT. (paras 23, 25, 26 &amp; 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The findings of the SCIT were made upon a full appreciation of the facts and were not perverse to the evidence. There was no reason to interfere with its findings of fact. The SCIT addressed the correct questions of law. Hence, the SCIT did not err on its determination on the questions of law and its application to the facts to warrant intervention by the courts.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, Kenny Heights Development Sdn Bhd ("KHD") appealed to this court against the decision of the High Court made on 22 May 2014, to allow with costs of RM5,000.00 the appeal by the respondent, Ketua Pengarah Hasil Dalam Negeri ("the KPHDN") against the deciding order of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax ("the SCIT") which set aside the determination by the KPHDN dated 1 March 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The brief facts may be stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Issues Before The SCIT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> KHD's submissions put the issues before the SCIT as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The submissions for the KPHDN before the SCIT set out the issues as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Per the case stated by the SCIT, the issues were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Both KHD and the KPHDN put the same issues to the High Court as they did before the SCIT.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The High Court summed up the issues to one question:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Issues Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Before this court, it was submitted for KHD that the issues were:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The submissions for the KPHDN set out the issues as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It is clear, thus, that the central issues at all times were:</p>
    <p>(a) what are the disposal dates and the consideration price of the Conditional Agreements dated 14 August 2000 subsequently amended by supplemental agreements dated 14 February 2003;</p>
    <p>(b) whether the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2007_146;;">Real Property Gains Tax (Exemption) (No 2) Order 2007, PU(A) 146</LINK> dated 27 March 2007 applied to exempt the appellant from real property gains tax; and</p>
    <p>(c) whether the Notice of Assessment for YA 2000 dated 31 December 2008 is statute-barred by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;15.;;">s 15(1) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The relevant provision applicable to Conditional Agreements is <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16(a) and (b) of sch 2 of the Real Property Gains Tax Act 1976 (Act 169)</LINK> (hereafter "<LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16</LINK>" and "the Act" as applicable).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b>
      <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">Paragraph 16</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The operative words are "unless the amount of the consideration depends wholly or mainly on the value of the asset at the time when the condition is satisfied in which case the acquisition and disposal shall be regarded as taking place when the condition is satisfied". In direct language, the amount of consideration is the actual consideration as at the time the conditions were satisfied, and the date of disposal is regarded as the date the conditions were satisfied. In this case, the amount of consideration at the time the conditions were satisfied by 27 April 2007 was no longer the consideration price set out in the S/P agreements dated 14 August 2000, but the consideration as amended and set out in the supplemental agreements dated 14 February 2003. By the time the Notice of Assessment for YA 2000 dated 31 December 2008 was issued, the actual consideration price was the consideration price under the supplemental agreements. The price set out in the S/P agreements had by then become history. In other words, the Notice of Assessment for YA 2000 dated 31 December 2008 was based upon a fiction. We have no doubt that the error would not have been made if the consideration price under the supplemental agreements had been higher than that set out in the S/P agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Since by operation of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16</LINK>, the date of disposal was 27 April 2007, KHD is clearly entitled to the exemption under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2007_146;;">Real Property Gains Tax (Exemption) (No 2) Order 2007, PU(A) 146</LINK> dated 27 March 2007 and gazetted 1 April 2001. The 2007 Order provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The exemption remained in force until 31 December 2009. KHD is therefore entitled to the exemption.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The power of the Director General of the LHDN to make additional assessments is contained in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;15.;;">s 15(1) of the Act</LINK>. The section provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Thus, excepting only the case of any form of fraud or wilful default, there is a limitation of five years after the end of that year of assessment to make an additional assessment. The five-year limitation applies to assessments determined by the court on an appeal or review, even though when the determination by the court is outside the control of the LHDN. Therefore, although the date by which the conditions were complied with is outside the control of the LHDN and, for that matter, the five-year limitation would similarly remain applicable. In our view, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;15.;;">s 15 of the Act</LINK> warrants review, but until that is done and amendments made, the law as it stands places a five-year limitation, and accordingly the assessment by Notice of Assessment for YA 2000 dated 31 December 2008 and served on 2 February 2009 is statute-barred by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;15.;;">s 15(1) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Further Findings Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The appeal before this court is an appeal from the decision of the High Court which allowed the KPHDN-s appeal against the decision of the SCIT in the form of a deciding order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We examined the Grounds of Judgment of the High Court. We found that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We observe that apart from the title "Kes dinyatakan oleh pesuruhjaya khas cukai pendapatan bagi pendapat Mahkamah Tinggi menurut <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;;">perenggan 34 jadual 5 Akta Cukai Pendapatan 1967</LINK> rayuan no PKCP (R) 60/2009", no further reference was made by the High Court to the SCIT and its case stated even though <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;;">sch 5 of the Income Tax Act 1967 (Act 53)</LINK> provides specifically that the decision of the SCIT is final. <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;;">Paragraph 23</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b>
      <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;;">Paragraphs 34, 37 to 39 of sch 5</LINK> provides for appeals against the deciding order of the SCIT as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The appeal to the High Court is upon a case stated by the SCIT. <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;;">Paragraph 39 of sch 5</LINK> is specific that the High Court is limited to questions of law arising from the case stated. The KPHDN is, as other parties are, bound by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_53;;">para 39</LINK>. Examination of the case stated by the SCIT shows a meticulous presentation of the facts, the evidence, the submissions, the relevant law and reasoning on the SCIT. It demonstrated a thorough appreciation and consideration of the facts. It does not betray <i>ex facie</i> any error on any question of law as to warrant appellate intervention.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Re-examining the Grounds of Judgment of the High Court, we cannot but observe the High Court only had a different view of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16</LINK>. We have dealt with that view and how it was arrived at earlier above. But apart from the different view which the High Court held and sought to explain in its Grounds of Judgment, the Grounds of Judgment clearly did not demonstrate with reasoning any error on the part of the SCIT in the case stated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We make the general observation that courts, acting in accordance with the law, are at all times bound by the legislation placing jurisdiction and authority in specialised bodies such as the SCIT. The legislation specified that the deciding order of the SCIT is final and allowed appeals to the court on question of law and not any grievance. It underlines, within the SCIT-s jurisdiction, its authority, and prevents the courts being buried under an avalanche of tax appeals by parties unhappy with the determination of the KPHDN and the SCIT.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Courts must also bear in mind the SCIT's specialisation. Dealing with terms and practises of the business and the business community enables them to have a special insight, understanding and appreciation of the evidence and facts, to make the findings drawn from those evidence and facts. While a finding of fact often touches upon the law, the determining factor in the finding is their special insight and appreciation of the facts. Hence, unless it is demonstrated that SCIT had erred on a question of law, resulting in a manifest error in the deciding order, the court cannot intervene, as it would amount to interference contrary to the intent of legislation setting up and empowering the SCIT. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1994_1_262;"><i>Lower Perak Co-Operative Housing Society Berhad v. Ketua Pengarah Hasil Dalam Negeri</i> [1994] 1 MLRA 262</LINK>; [1994] 2 MLJ 713; [1994] 3 CLJ 541; [1994] 2 AMR 1735].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As our observations demonstrate, the High Court had a different view of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16</LINK> but it failed to provide its reasoning for that different view. It also failed to demonstrate where the SCIT had erred on a question of law. Without doing so, the intervention by the High Court was without justification and was an interference with the decision of the SCIT.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Having set out the introduction and the issues for determination, the submissions for KPHDN before this court went on to set out the facts of the case, the KPH-s contentions, duty of the appellate court, misdirection in law and facts by the SCIT, the grounds of judgment of the High Court and KPHDN-s submission on the issue for determination. The submissions for the KPHDN failed to demonstrate:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The submissions for the KPHDN before this court, essentially repeating the arguments before the High Court, were therefore nothing more than expression of disagreement with the decision of the SCIT. The submissions on interpretation of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16</LINK> failed to demonstrate that the SCIT had erred in its application of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We examined further the case stated by the SCIT. We found the reasoning at para 10 was systematic and meticulous. Nothing in it contains the element of absurdity [see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_116;"><i>DYTM Tengku Idris Shah Ibni Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah v. Dikim Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 116</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 11; [2002] 2 CLJ 57; [2002] 2 AMR 1503]. It was well reasoned. It did not contain in it anything that is <i>ex facie</i> bad in law, or that the finding is such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination. [See <i>Lower Perak Co-Operative Housing Society Berhad v. Ketua Pengarah Hasil Dalam Negeri (supra)</i>]. We could find no error as would demand appellate intervention by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is superfluous to observe that <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_169;;">para 16</LINK> says that when conditions of a conditional contract are satisfied, the acquisition and disposal of the asset shall be deemed to have taken place at the time the conditional contract was made, unless the amount of consideration depends wholly or mainly on the value of the asset when the condition was satisfied, in which case the acquisition and disposal shall be regarded as taking place when the condition is satisfied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In the instant case, the case stated shows that the SCIT fully appreciated the nature and terms of the approvals by the Securities Commission. Paragraph 8 of the case stated shows a clear appreciation of the contentions of both KHD and the KPHDN, and the relevant authorities at para 9. At para 10, the SCIT set out their reasons. The SCIT appreciated and took into consideration these essential facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The findings of the SCIT were made upon a full appreciation of the facts. The findings of fact were not perverse to the evidence. There was no reason to interfere with its findings of fact. The SCIT addressed the correct questions of law. We find that the SCIT did not so err on its determination on the questions of law and its application to the facts to warrant intervention by the courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Accordingly, we allow the appeal with costs, which we fix at RM10,000.00, set aside the decision of the High Court and restore the deciding order of the Special Commissioners of Income Tax made on 1 March 2013, and deposit be refunded.</p>
