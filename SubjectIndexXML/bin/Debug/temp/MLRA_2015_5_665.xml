    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the concurrent findings of the High Court and the Court of Appeal allowing the respondent's claim against the appellant, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC')</LINK>. At all material times, Majlis Perbandaran Manjung ('MPM') was the registered proprietor of a piece of land ('the land') which was later divided into various lots. Vide a joint venture agreement MPM appointed Bersatu Maju Properties Sdn Bhd ('BMP') as a developer to develop the land. Thereafter, MPM and BMP executed various sales and purchase agreements ('SPAs') in relation to the lots in favour of a number of purchasers ('the earlier purchasers'). Pursuant to the SPAs, various letters of offer were issued and various loan agreements were executed between the respondent bank ('the respondent') and the earlier purchasers to finance the purchase of the said lots. In order to facilitate the granting of the loans the earlier purchasers executed separate deeds of assignment whereby they assigned absolutely all their respective titles, rights to and/or interest in the lots in favour of the respondent. The earlier purchasers later defaulted in the repayment of their loans. In the meantime, the land was sub-divided and MPM and BMP proceeded to sell the lots to new purchasers which included the appellant without the knowledge of the respondent. Upon such discovery, the respondent lodged private caveats on the lots and subsequently brought legal proceedings against, amongst others, the new purchasers, MPM and BMP. The High Court allowed its claim to declare the earlier purchasers the rightful owners of the lots in question and that the respondent was the legal assignee of the titles and interests to the said lots by virtue of the various deeds of assignment. That decision was later affirmed by the Court of Appeal. In this appeal, the court granted leave to the appellant to determine the following question: whether the title of <i>bona fide</i> registered owner without notice under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code ('NLC')</LINK> could be defeated by a non-registered interest of an assignee/lender under an earlier sale and purchase agreement in respect of the same piece of land with other purchasers other than the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> At the time when the loan agreements were signed, the earlier purchasers had no legal ownership to the lots as the land had not been sub-divided and the documents of title had not been issued. Therefore, the deeds of assignment executed in favour of the respondent were expressly for the purpose of securing the loans given to the earlier purchasers to purchase the lots. In the result, the deeds of assignment were treated as equitable mortgages of the earlier purchasers' rights, titles and interests under the SPAs. It followed that the respondent became an equitable mortgagee. Accordingly, when the earlier purchasers defaulted in their repayments of the loans, the respondent was entitled to invoke cl 3(a) of the deeds of assignment, ie "to deal with all the rights and interest in relation to the said property absolutely and beneficially." Furthermore, both MPM and BMP had issued letters of undertaking in favour of the respondent, whereby MPM consented to the deeds of assignment and undertook to take all reasonable steps to obtain separate issue documents of title to the land and to deliver them to the respondent. The terms of the undertaking were clear and unambiguous. Thus, both MPM and BMP were legally obliged to honour their undertakings. (paras 39, 40, 43, 44 &amp; 45)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> MPM, being the registered proprietor of the land after executing the SPAs with the earlier purchasers and having received the full purchase price, was a bare trustee and was therefore not permitted in law to sell or transfer the land to the new purchasers (including the appellant). Consequently, the subsequent sales, transfers or conveyances of the lots by MPM to the new purchasers (including the appellant) were void <i>ab initio</i>, as MPM did not have any legal or requisite capacity to enter into such agreements. (paras 53-54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was nothing in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> which expressly or by necessary implication excluded or prohibited any equitable interest in alienated land, and the court ought to give effect to ordinary commercial transactions and not to invalidate any equitable mortgage created by contracts outside any statutory provisions for registration of title under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>. In the instant case, the undisputed facts clearly showed that the SPAs as well as the deeds of assignment with the earlier purchasers were valid and enforceable; and the subsequent SPAs with the new purchasers (including the appellant) were void <i>ab initio</i> and of no effect. It followed that their related transfer forms (Form 14A of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>) were also void and ineffective to create a registrable transfer. (paras 65 &amp; 70)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In <i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Goh Tuan Laye &amp; Ors</i>, it was held that an equitable interest in land was not affected by the absence of a caveat, "as a caveat in itself does not create an interest but merely gives notice to the world of the presence of an interest belonging to someone other than the registered proprietor". Therefore, the failure on the part of the respondent to lodge a caveat timeously, did not in any way negate or defeat its equitable rights, title and interests in respect of the lot in question. (<i>CPR v. District Registrar of Dauphin Land Titles Office (refd)</i>; <i>Ng Kheng Yeow v. Chiah Ah Foo &amp; Ors (refd)</i>; <i>Chua Hee Hung &amp; Ors v. QBE Supreme Insurance Bhd (folld)</i>) (paras 73-77)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant case, as the relevant Form 14A of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> was a void instrument, consequently, the appellant's title and interest in the lot was indisputably defeasible. The appellant was an immediate purchaser of the lot in question from its registered proprietor, MPM. That being the case the appellant clearly could not enjoy the benefit of the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3) of the NLC</LINK>. Once the court was satisfied that the transfer of the title to the appellant arose from a void instrument, "it automatically follows that they are liable to be set aside", as per <i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors</i>. Accordingly, the question posed to the court was answered in the affirmative. (paras 86-87)</p>

      <b>[5]</b> MPM, vide a Joint Venture Agreement dated 19 November 1998 appointed a company known as Bersatu Maju Properties Sdn Bhd (BMP) (the 10th defendant at the High Court), as a developer to develop the land into a mixed development project including three-storey shop offices thereon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Thereafter, on various dates (between 10 October 2001 and 21 January 2002) MPM and BMP executed various sales and purchase agreements in relation to the Lots in favour of the following purchasers - namely, Mohd Yusoff bin Baharom (Lot 3); Ong Kee Chai and Ong Lai King (Lot 4); Wong Siew Ming (Lot 5); Ong Sang Huat Holdings Sdn Bhd (Lot 6); and Lim Peng Guan and Beatrice Veronica Arulappen (Lot 7). For the purpose of the present appeal, all the abovenamed purchasers are collectively referred to as "the earlier purchasers".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The respondent, at the request of the earlier purchasers had granted loans to enable them to finance the purchase of the Lots. For that purpose various letters of offer were issued and various loan agreements were executed between the respondent and the respective earlier purchasers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> At the material time, when the sale and purchase agreements and the loan agreements were executed, the individual title for each of the Lots had not been issued yet. Thus in order to facilitate the granting of the loans the earlier purchasers executed separate deeds of assignment whereby they assigned absolutely all their respective titles, rights to and/or interest in the Lots in favour of the respondent. As an added security for the loans, MPM and BMP furnished the respondent with Letters of Undertaking, whereby MPM and BMP expressly undertook to deliver the documents of title to the Lots, upon issuance thereof, to the respondent to facilitate the execution of the relevant memorandums of transfer in favour of each of the earlier purchasers and the execution of legal charges in favour of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the strength of all the loan agreements, the deeds of assignment and the Letters of Undertaking, loans were granted and duly disbursed in full to BMP as the purchase price for the Lots in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Unknown to the respondent, the land (comprising the Lots) was subsequently sub-divided and temporary documents of title were issued by the Registrar of Land Title, Perak on or about 27 June 2003. MPM and BMP failed to notify and deliver the individual documents of title to the respondent as agreed in their Letters of Undertaking. Sometime in November 2004, the respondent discovered that MPM and BMP had sold the Lots to the 1st to 5th defendants (including the appellant herein), and executed various sale and purchase agreements with them (the new purchasers). The title to the Lots were then transferred to and registered in the name of the new purchasers, including the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Upon such discovery, the respondent, lodged private caveats on the Lots. In the meantime, the earlier purchasers defaulted in the repayments of their loans to the respondent. The respondent commenced civil suits against each of them and accordingly obtained judgment against them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The respondent commenced the present action on 26 July 2007 against MPM, BMP and the new purchasers, asking, <i>inter alia</i> for:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The respondent also prayed for other consequential reliefs and damages to be awarded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> A default judgment was entered against BMP, and a consent judgment was recorded against MPM. With regard to the other defendants (the new purchasers), the respondent applied for judgment summarily pursuant to an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application. As indicated in his Affidavit-in-Reply to encl 62, the appellant (as the 1st defendant) agreed with the respondent that the matter could be dealt with summarily under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> and need not go for full trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The legal questions for determination in the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> On 27 July 2011, the High Court after hearing the parties answered all the questions in favour of the respondent and accordingly allowed the respondent's claims. The High Court made various orders in favour of the respondent (in Bahasa Malaysia), the effects of which can be summarised as follows:</p>

      <b>At The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The appellant and two other defendants then appealed to the Court of Appeal against the above decision. On 22 March 2012, the appeal was unanimously dismissed with costs. In affirming the decision of the High Court, the Court of Appeal made, <i>inter alia</i>, the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Leave Question</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Dissatisfied with the Court of Appeal's decision, the appellant together with two other defendants filed an application for leave to appeal to this court. On 19 June 2013, this court granted leave to appeal on the following question:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, as we have said notice of appeal was filed only by the appellant and the appeals by the others are deemed discontinued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellant's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that, on the undisputed facts of the case, the decision of the High Court was erroneous, and in consequence the decision of the Court of Appeal, affirming the High Court decision, was also wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Learned counsel also submitted that "in the year 2004, following the sub-division of the subject property, and the individual titles issued therefor the appellant purchased the subject land from MPM, the registered proprietor of the subject property and BMP, the developer, named the vendor in the sale and purchase agreement; and following the transfer executed in the prescribed form the appellant became the registered proprietor of the subject land on the 6 December 2004".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Learned counsel further submitted that the respondent lodged its private caveats relating to its loan agreements with the earlier purchasers only in 2005. When the appellant purchased his Lot in 2004, the registered proprietor of the Lot was MPM and there was no other impediment for the purchase and the subsequent transfer of the Lot to the appellant. Therefore, the respondent has only itself to blame for having lost its priority over the Lot and for its failure to protect its interest immediately after the loan agreements were executed with the earlier purchasers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is also submitted by learned counsel that in purchasing the Lot from MPM, the appellant had no knowledge whatsoever of the earlier transactions involving the earlier purchasers; and therefore by virtue of the registration, the appellant had acquired a legal interest (not merely an equitable interest) and an indefeasible title in the Lot. The appellant claimed that he was a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser without notice who had paid the full purchase price as valuable consideration, and therefore his title over the Lot could not be defeated by the respondent's non-registered interest under the earlier sale and purchase agreements with the earlier purchasers in respect of the Lots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Respondent's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the appellant's registered title in the Lot was not indefeasible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)(b) of the NLC</LINK> and ought to be set aside as the registration was done by means of an "insufficient or void instrument". The respondent further argued that at the time when the appellant executed his sale and purchase agreement in respect of the Lot on 22 March 2004, the earlier purchasers (as borrowers of the loans granted by the respondent) were fully vested with the rights, titles and interests to the Lots, and such rights, titles and interests have been absolutely assigned to the respondent vide the deeds of assignment duly executed by them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The respondent further argued that since MPM and BMP as the vendor had received the full purchase price from the earlier purchasers (as disbursed by the respondent), MPM had become a bare trustee to the Lots for the earlier purchasers, and later by virtue of the deeds of assignment, for the respondent; and therefore MPM was not in a capacity to subsequently sell or transfer the Lots to the appellant and the other new purchasers. Thus MPM was not permitted to enter into the sale and purchase agreements with them in respect of the Lots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The respondent contended that the relevant Forms 14A in respect of the transfers of the titles to the Lots to the new purchasers (including the appellant) were consequently void and there can be no rights, titles or interests conveyed to the new purchasers. As a bare trustee, MPM was no longer vested with the rights to the Lots and as such did not have any legal authority to execute the sale and purchase agreements. The appellant's title was therefore defeasible. The respondent argued that being an immediate purchaser the appellant was precluded from availing himself to the protection under the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3) of the NLC</LINK> and the title ought to be set aside pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(1)(b) of the NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On the issue of the failure to lodge a caveat, the respondent submitted that a caveat does not create any interest or encumbrance in land; and the respondent's rights as equitable mortgagee of the said Lots are not prejudiced by the absence of private caveat lodged by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The respondent, therefore, urged this court to answer the leave question in the affirmative and to dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellant's Unpleaded Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Based on the pleadings as well as the statements of agreed facts between the parties, at the time when MPM entered into the sale and purchase agreements with the earlier purchasers on various dates between 10 October 2001 and 21 January 2002, MPA was the registered proprietor/owner of the land in question. This fact has been agreed upon and not disputed at all at the High Court, the Court of Appeal as well as during main submissions before us in the present appeal. Even during the respondent's application for an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> proceeding at the High Court, the appellant had clearly indicated to the truth of the fact that MPM, at the material time, was the registered proprietor/owner of the land when the sale and purchase agreements were executed with the earlier purchasers. Being an agreed issue, this point of MPM being a registered owner was not raised at all by either party at the High Court as well as at the Court of Appeal or even at the stage of the main submissions of the present appeal before us. Neither was it mentioned in the written submissions by both counsel filed before us. It was only during submission-in-reply before us that the co-counsel for the appellant, Mr Gobind Singh Deo raised this new issue by drawing our attention to Borang 11A (Suratan Hakmilik Sementara), Kanun Tanah Negara in respect of the land in question (at pp 107-109 of the Rekod Rayuan Jld 2), where he claimed that there was an endorsement to show that at the time when the respective sale and purchase agreements were executed between MPM and the earlier purchasers between 10 October 2001 and 21 January 2002, MPM was not the registered proprietor/owner of the land and thus had no right to deal with it, as the land had earlier been surrendered and vested in the State Authority on 3 September 2000. Therefore counsel claimed that the sale and purchase agreements as well as the deeds of assignments executed by the earlier purchasers were void and invalid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> This is totally a new issue raised by the appellant's co-counsel before us at the submission-in-reply stage. It was not pleaded at all. It went against the pleaded case of the appellant himself (as well as the respondent) that at the material times, MPM was the registered proprietor/owner of the land and that the existence of the sale and purchase agreements with the earlier purchasers, the deeds of assignment in favour of the respondent as well as the Letters of Undertaking issued by MPM and BMP in favour of the respondent were not disputed at all. Clearly, the respondent was caught by surprise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings On This Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It is a cardinal rule in civil litigation that parties are bound by their pleadings and are not allowed to adduce facts and issues which they have not pleaded (see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_423;"><i>State Government Of Perak v. Muniandy</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 423</LINK>; [1986] 1 MLJ 490 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1989_4_388;"><i>Anuar Bin Mat Amin v. Abdullah Bin Mohd Zain</i> [1989] 4 MLRH 388</LINK>; [1989] 3 MLJ 313). In <i>Blay v. Pollard &amp; Morris</i> [1930] 1 KB 628, Scrutton LJ ruled that: "Cases must be decided on the issues on the record; and if it is desired to raise other issues there must be pleaded on the record by amendment."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_2_6;"><i>Lee Ah Chor v. Southern Bank Bhd</i> [1990] 2 MLRA 6</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 428; [1991] 1 CLJ 239, had also emphasised the importance of pleadings and ruled that where a vital issue was not raised in the pleadings it could not be allowed to be argued and to succeed on appeal (see also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_459;"><i>Ambank (M) Berhad v. Luqman Kamil Mohammed Don</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 459</LINK>; [2012] 3 CLJ 551).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> On the same issue, HRH Raja Azlan Shah FJ (as HRH then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1974_1_176;"><i>The Chartered Bank v. Yong Chan</i> [1974] 1 MLRA 176</LINK>; [1974] 1 MLJ 157, had also pointed out that "as the trial judge had decided on an issue which was not raised in the pleadings, the judgment must be set aside and new trial ordered" (see also: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1955_1_615;"><i>Haji Mohamed Dom v. Sakiman</i> [1955] 1 MLRA 615</LINK>; [1956] 1 MLJ 45 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1964_1_546;"><i>Kiaw Aik Hang Co Ltd v. Tan Tien Choy</i> [1964] 1 MLRH 546</LINK>; [1964] 1 MLJ 99).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Based on the above observation and principle, we are of the view that the 'last minute' issue raised by Mr Gobind Singh Deo, co-counsel for the appellant, that at the time when the sale and purchase agreements with the earlier purchasers were executed, MPM was not the registered proprietor/ owner of the land must be disregarded and not to be considered at all in determining the appeal before us. In doing so, we adopt the observation by HRH Raja Azlan Shah CJM (as HRH then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_226;"><i>KEP Mohamed Ali v. KEP Mohamed Ismail</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 226</LINK>; [1981] 2 MLJ 10:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The issue raised, if accepted, would completely change the character of the appellant's defence to the respondent's claim and would be highly prejudicial to the respondent's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> For the purpose of the present appeal, we will only consider the pleaded case of the parties before us. To borrow the words of Gopal Sri Ram JCA in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_2_313;"><i>Cheong Heng Loong Goldsmiths (KL) Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor v. Capital Insurance Bhd</i> [2003] 2 MLRA 313</LINK>; [2004] 1 MLJ 353; [2004] 1 CLJ 357; [2004] 1 AMR 333, "... once a defendant takes that course, he must stand and fall on his pleaded case; we cannot simultaneously put forward an unpleaded case ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In the premise, we are of the view that the respective sale and purchase agreements executed by MPM, BMP and the respective earlier purchasers as agreed in the pleadings are valid and enforceable in law. It follows that all the related deeds of assignment executed by the earlier purchasers in favour of the respondent as well as the Letters of Undertaking issued by MPM and BMP in favour of the respondent and the loan agreements executed by the earlier purchasers and the respondent are also valid and enforceable in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Deeds Of Assignment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Clause 1 of the deeds of assignment, provides that the appellant as the borrower and the assignor, "hereby ASSIGNS ABSOLUTELY to the bank the full and entire benefit of the Assignor's rights, title and interest whatsoever in and to and under the sale and purchase agreement and the Related Document (s) and in the said Property together with the Assignor's right of enforcement thereof or thereunder as security for the said Loan".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It also provides that "the Assignor shall and hereby undertakes to continue to observe, perform and be bound by all whatever conditions covenants and stipulations therein ... contained in the sale and purchase agreement, the Related Document (s) and as contained in the loan agreement".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Under cl 3(a) thereof, if the assignor shall commit a default pursuant to the terms of the deed or if any of the events of default in the loan agreement shall happen or at any time after the loan secured shall have become immediately repayable to the respondent under the loan agreement, the respondent shall be entitled without notice to the assignor "to enter upon and take possession of the said property or any part or parts thereof and to deal with all the rights and interest of the bank in relation to the said property or otherwise in all respect as the person absolutely and beneficially entitled thereto".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> At the time when the loan agreements were signed, the earlier purchasers had no legal ownership to the Lots as the land had not been sub-divided and the documents of title had not been issued. The deeds of assignment executed in favour of the respondent were expressly for the purpose of securing the loans given to the earlier purchasers to purchase the Lots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We agree with the Court of Appeal that the deeds of assignment in the present case are treated as equitable mortgages (where the respondent was an equitable mortgagee) of the earlier purchasers' rights, titles and interests under the sale and purchase agreements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The law on assignment is governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;4.;;">s 4(3) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>, which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The effect of an absolute assignment was explained at length by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_420;"><i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 420</LINK>; [1998] 3 MLJ 97; [1999] 2 CLJ 917; [1995] 3 AMR 2331, p 425 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As the loan agreement with the appellant is in law an equitable mortgage, it follows that the respondent in the present case became an equitable mortgagee. In <i>The Law of Real Property</i>, (5th edn) by Sir Robert Megarry and HWR Wade at p 914, the learned authors state that "a mortgage is a conveyance of property legal or equitable subject to a right of redemption." This concept of equitable mortgage has been recognised by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_128;"><i>Phileoallied Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v. Bupinder Singh Avatar Singh &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 128</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 513; [2002] 2 CLJ 621; [1999] 3 AMR 3086, where it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We are in full agreement with the above principle. In the present case, the loan was fully disbursed by the respondent by 13 February 2003 to the developer (BMP), and the earlier purchasers, as the borrowers in the loan agreements defaulted in their repayments of the loans as stipulated under cl 1.1 thereof, thus triggering an event of default under cl 30.1. That being the case, the respondent was entitled to invoke cl 3(a) of the deeds of assignment, ie "to deal with all the rights and interest in relation to the said property absolutely and beneficially."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> To strengthen the respondent's rights and interests on the Lot, MPM and BMP had issued Letters of Undertaking in favour of the respondent. In the said Letters of Undertaking dated 13 December 2001, MPM consented to the deeds of assignment issued by the earlier purchasers in favour of the respondent and undertook to take all reasonable steps to obtain separate issue documents of title to the land and, subsequently, to deliver to the respondent "the Separate Document of Title to the said property upon issue thereof together with the registrable transfer in favour of the Assignor or any other documents as shall be incumbent upon us to produce to secure the registration of the Assignor as the registered proprietor of the said Property within six months from the date hereof." The terms of the undertaking are clear and unambiguous. Therefore, both MPM and BMP are legally obliged to honour their undertakings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Bare Trustee</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> It is not in dispute that the land was subsequently sub-divided into various lots and temporary documents of title in respect of the Lots were issued by the Registrar of Land Titles, Perak on or about 27 June 2003. MPM and BMP failed to notify the respondent, and to deliver to the respondent the documents of title with the registrable transfer in favour of the respondent as agreed in their Letters of Undertaking. In fact, the Lots were sold to third parties (including the appellant) after the relevant documents of title were issued. Upon discovery of the subsequent sale, the respondent lodged private caveats on the Lots. Clearly, MPM had committed a breach of the undertakings given earlier in favour of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> As indicated earlier, there were valid sale and purchase agreements in respect of the Lots between MPM, BMP and the earlier purchasers. In law, the Lots had already been sold by MPM and BMP to the earlier purchasers, who had paid the full purchase price by 13 February 2003. Therefore the earlier purchasers were fully vested with the rights, titles and interests to the Lots which rights, titles and interests were in turn absolutely assigned to the respondent as the lender.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In this regard, Jessel MR in <i>Lysaght v. Edwards</i> [1876] 2 Ch D 499 had the occasion to explain the meaning of the term "valid contract" or "valid agreement" in a sale transaction and its effect in law. At p 507 of the report, His Lordship said "Valid contract means in every case a contract sufficient in form and in substance, so that there is no ground whatever for setting it aside as between the vendor and purchaser a contract binding on both parties".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> It was clearly stated in that case that the effect of a contract for sale has been settled for centuries. At p 506, His Lordship explained the following legal doctrine:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> His Lordship (in <i>Lysaght</i>'s case) also adopted an earlier authority where Lord Justice Turner in <i>Hadley v. London Bank of Scotland</i> 12 (LT) 747 held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Back home, the above principle had been adopted and followed by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1974_1_163;"><i>Temenggong Securities Ltd &amp; Anor v. Registrar Of Titles, Johore &amp; Ors</i> [1974] 1 MLRA 163</LINK>, [1974] 2 MLJ 45 where it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> We are in full agreement and adopt the above well-founded principles of law which, according to Jessel MR in <i>Lysaght</i>'s case, "has been settled for centuries". Applying the said principles to the facts of the present case before us, we hold that MPM, being the registered proprietor of the land after executing the sale and purchase agreements with the earlier purchasers and having received the full purchase price, was a bare trustee (that is, a person without beneficial interest in the property); and to borrow the words of Jessel, MR in <i>Lysaght</i>'s case ... "the court will not permit the vendor afterwards to transfer the legal estate to a third person." In other words, MPM in the present case, was therefore not permitted in law to sell or transfer the land to the new purchasers (including the appellant).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The Court of Appeal was right in finding that MPM, after having entered in the sale and purchase agreements with the earlier purchasers and received the full payments of the purchase price, had become a bare trustee and as such was not permitted to deal with the Lots. We are in agreement with the Court of Appeal that the subsequent sales, transfers or conveyances of the Lots by MPM to the new purchasers (including the appellant) were void <i>ab initio</i>, as MPM did not have any legal or requisite capacity to enter into such agreements.</p>

      <b>Indefeasibility Of Title And Interest - <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">Section 340 Of The NLC</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> It is not in dispute that in the year 2004, after the land had been sub-divided and documents of title issued, MPM and BMP entered into subsequent sale and purchase agreements with the new purchasers (including the appellant). The appellant claimed that he had no knowledge whatsoever of the earlier dealings in respect of the land. The appellant had paid the full purchase price for the said purchase and a prescribed transfer form (Form 14A) was executed in his favour on 30 September 2004. The appellant claimed that he became the registered proprietor of the Lot purchased by him when the transfer form was registered on 6 December 2004. At the material time the respondent had not lodged any caveat on the land following its loan agreements with the earlier purchasers. The respondent only lodged its private caveats in the year 2005 after realising the fact relating to the sales and transfers of the Lots to the new purchasers (including the appellant) by which time they had already become the registered proprietors of the Lots.</p>

      <b>[56]</b> The appellant argued that as at the date of his registration as the registered proprietor of the Lot (on 6 December 2004) there was absolutely no impediment to the sale and transfer of the Lot and the registration of its title in his favour. The appellant further claimed that by virtue of the registration of the title to his name, he had acquired a legal interest in the Lot (which was a registered proprietor and not merely an equitable interest) and therefore such legal interest which was acquired by him must necessarily take precedence over any unregistered equitable interest that the respondent may possibly have in the Lot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The appellant submitted that in the circumstances his interest in the Lot was indefeasible and must stand indefeasible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>. The respondent, on other hand claimed that the appellant's sale and purchase agreement with MPM in respect of the Lot was ineffective and incapable of conferring any rights to him as the relevant transfer form (Form 14A) in respect of the Lot which was executed by MPM pursuant to the void sale and purchase agreement, was also invalid and therefore no interest could be conveyed through it to the appellant. The respondent claimed that the said Form 14A was an "insufficient or void instrument".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> The issue of indefeasibility of title and interest in alienated land is governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">Section 340(1)</LINK> provides:</p>

The subsection reads:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> The question for determination before us brings into focus the statutory rights of a registered land proprietor/owner as conferred by the statutory provisions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK> as against an equitable right of an unregistered interest of an assignee or lender under an earlier sale and purchase agreement and deed of assignment in respect of the same piece of land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The question as to what extent the rules of equity are recognised and applied by our courts was explained by the Federal Court in <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 420, where it was held that "Rules of equity in general are applicable by virtue of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;;">Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> and those rules of equity relating to equitable interests in land have no doubt always been recognised and applied in Malaysia unless they are expressly or by necessary implication precluded by the Code. This view has been asserted and reasserted in a number of cases in the appellate courts in Malaysia."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The issues of 'equitable interest in land' and 'equitable mortgagee' had been dealt with in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1936_1_175;"><i>ARRM Arunasalam Chetty Son Of Sithambaram Chetty v. Teah Ah Poh Trading Under The Style Of Mun Seng Hin Kee; Teah Soo Chew Trading Under The Style Of Teah Chin Seng</i> [1936] 1 MLRA 175</LINK>; [1937] 1 MLJ 17, where the Court of Appeal then, unanimously held that the deposit of the documents of title as security for repayment of debts, operated as an equitable charge by virtue of which the party who lent the money acquired an equitable interest in the land covered by the document of title. It was also held that the creditor therein was also an equitable mortgagee by the deposit of the document of title and decided that the security did not contravene the provisions of the Kedah Land Code, which was based on the FMS Land Enactment 1911 and the Registration of Titles Enactment 1911, all in fact based on the Torrens system of registration of titles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> It is also appropriate to refer to a passage in the judgment of Terrell Ag CJ (FMS) in that case (<i>Arunasalam Chetty</i>) where at pp 182 and 183, His Lordship said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> There is nothing in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> which expressly or by necessary implication excludes or prohibits any equitable interest in alienated land, and the court ought to give effect to ordinary commercial transactions and not to invalidate any equitable mortgage created by contracts outside any statutory provisions for registration of title under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)(b)</LINK>, the title or interest of any person for the time being registered as proprietor of any alienated land shall not be indefeasible where the registration was obtained by means of an insufficient or void instrument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> In "<i>Tenure and Land Dealings in the Malay States</i>" by David SY Wong, at p 364 the author explained the phrase "insufficient or void instrument" for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)(b) of the NLC</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> The same issue was dealt with by our court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1937_1_335;"><i>Puran Singh v. Kehar Singh Bahadur Singh</i> [1937] 1 MLRH 335</LINK>; [1939] 8 MLJ 71 where it was held that the memorandum of transfer in that case was not signed by an authorised attorney as required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;110.;;">ss 110</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;180.;;">180 of the relevant Land Code</LINK> and therefore the said memorandum of transfer was declared to be an insufficient instrument and that the registration by means of the transfer was void by virtue of the proviso of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;42.;;">s 42(iii) of the relevant Land Code</LINK> which provides that: "If the registration of any proprietor, chargee or lessee has been obtained by forgery or by means of an insufficient or void instrument, such registration shall be void."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The appellant argued that the respondent's contention that his registered title or interest in the subject Lot was defeasible because its registration was obtained by means of insufficient or void instrument was very seriously flawed on the facts of the matter as well as the law on the ground that there was nothing to suggest and there was no evidence to show that the relevant Form 14A was an insufficient or void instrument within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)(b) of the NLC</LINK>. The appellant cited the decision of the High Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_1_38;"><i>Mook Meng Sun v. Loo Aa Kau &amp; Ors</i> [2002] 1 MLRH 38</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 193; [2002] 2 CLJ 142, where Abdul Aziz J held that for an instrument to be regarded as an insufficient or void instrument, there must be something about the instrument itself that renders it insufficient or void. However in that case, as a matter of fact, the learned judge found that there was no evidence as to that as regards the instrument of transfer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> In the present case, as we have shown earlier the undisputed facts of the case clearly show that the sale and purchase agreements as well as the deeds of assignment with the earlier purchasers are valid and enforceable; and the subsequent sale and purchase agreements with the new purchasers (including the appellant) are void <i>ab initio</i> and of no effect. It follows that their related transfer forms (Form 14A) must also be void and ineffective to create a registrable transfer. The agreed and undisputed facts of the case support the finding that there is sufficient evidence to show that the said Form 14A was in fact a void instrument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Failure To Lodge Caveat</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> The appellant also touched on the respondent's failure to lodge its private caveats following its loan agreements with the earlier purchasers timeously so as to protect its interest in respect of the dealings in the Lots. The appellant contended that the respondent, by its own indolence and omission had itself to blame for having lost its priority over the Lots in question; and such failure was fatal to its case. He cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_97;"><i>Jasalam (M) Sdn Bhd v. Wong Koon Yee</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 97</LINK>; [2000] 3 MLJ 115; [2000] 2 CLJ 377; [2000] 2 AMR 1811 to support his contention that "the respondent, although being the first in time acquiring the equitable ownership to the land, has lost his priority by his indolence and omission to enter a caveat within reasonable time."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> Under the Torrens system, caveat is devised for the protection of non-registrable interest on alienated land by allowing the caveator to be notified thereon in some manner. A caveat (so long as it continues in force) has the effect that the land in question shall not be transferred, charged or leased by the proprietor until such notice shall have been served on the caveator. The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> allows a person or body of persons to lodge a private caveat for the protection of his caveatable interest which he claims he is entitled to. The right to lodge a caveat is not dependent on the validity of the particular interest claimed. It is the claim of an interest within the category of caveatable interest that alone matters. (See: "<i>Tenure and Land Dealings in the Malay States</i>" by David SY Wong at p 418).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> It must be emphasised here that in law, a caveat does not create any rights or interest. This was explained by Tritscher J in <i>CPR v. District Registrar of Dauphin Land Titles Office</i> [1956] 4 DLR (2nd) 518 in the following words:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(See also: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_340;"><i>Chua Hee Hung &amp; Ors v. QBE Supreme Insurance Bhd</i> [1990] 1 MLRA 340</LINK>; [1990] 1 MLJ 480; [1990] 1 CLJ 49).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> The proposition was lucidly affirmed and adopted by Suffian LP in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1975_1_279;"><i>United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd v. Goh Tuan Laye &amp; Ors</i> [1975] 1 MLRA 279</LINK>; [1976] 1 MLJ 169, where it was held that an equitable interest in land was not affected by the absence of a caveat, "as a caveat in itself does not create an interest but merely gives notice to the world of the presence of an interest belonging to someone other than the registered proprietor."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_87;"><i>Ng Kheng Yeow v. Chiah Ah Foo &amp; Ors</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 87</LINK>; [1987] 2 MLJ 330; [1987] CLJ 254, the Supreme Court held that even though the respondent (in that case) failed to lodge a caveat, it did not deprive him in having a better equity against the appellant (in that case) who had lodged a caveat; the reason being that the appellant had nothing to caveat as the vendors had already sold all his interest to the respondent there.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> Lee Hun Hoe CJ (Borneo), in delivering the Supreme Court's judgment in <i>Chua Hee Hung &amp; Ors</i> reaffirmed the proposition as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> Adopting the above principle to the facts of the present case before us, we find that the failure on part of the respondent to lodge a caveat timeously, does not in any way negate or defeat its equitable rights, title and interests in respect of the Lot in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> The case of <i>Jasalam (M) Sdn Bhd</i> as cited by the appellant earlier can be distinguished. The issue in that case is different from the issue in the present case. There, the Court of Appeal was considering, <i>inter alia</i>, the priority of two parties with valid equitable interest in the land in dispute. In that case, the Court of Appeal followed the principle established in an Australian case of <i>Butler v. Fairclough</i>, 23 CLR 78, that in "the case of a contest between two equitable claimants, the first in time, all other things equal, is entitled to priority".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> In our view the principle as adopted in <i>Jasalam (M) Sdn Bhd</i> cannot be applied to the present case for the simple reason that in the present case we are not dealing with two parties with valid equitable interests in the land in question; but with one party, (ie the respondent) who claimed to have an equitable interest in the said land as against the other party, (ie the appellant) who had purchased the Lot based on a void and invalid sale and purchase agreement and later registered his title thereto based on a void instrument, rendering his title defeasible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)(b) of the NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Proviso To <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">Section 340(3) Of The NLC</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> The issue of the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3) of the NLC</LINK> was also raised before us. The appellant claimed that he was a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for valuable consideration and therefore by virtue of the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(3) of the NLC</LINK>, his title to the land was indefeasible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> The proviso reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The issue of the applicability of the proviso was dealt with at great length by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_1;"><i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 1; [2010] 2 CLJ 269. In that case, the court ruled, <i>inter alia</i>, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> It is pertinent to note that, in that case (<i>Tan Ying Hong</i>) the Federal Court overuled its earlier decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2000_1_869;"><i>Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd v. Boonsom Boonyanit</i> [2000] 1 MLRA 869</LINK>; [2001] 1 MLJ 241; [2001] 2 CLJ 133; [2001] 1 AMR 665 on the ground that the Federal Court in <i>Adorna Properties</i> had erroneously misconstrued <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(1), (2) and (3) of the NLC</LINK> and came to a wrong conclusion that the proviso to subsection (3) applied equally to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2)</LINK>. At paras 51, 52 and 53 of the judgment, Arifin Zakaria CJM (as he then was) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> The principle established in <i>Tan Ying Hong</i> was adopted and followed by this Court in a recent case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_2_432;"><i>Kamarulzaman Omar &amp; Ors v. Yakub Husin &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 2 MLRA 432</LINK>; [2014] 2 MLJ 768; [2014] 1 CLJ 987; [2014] 1 AMR 493 where at para 43, Jeffrey Tan FCJ said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> In the present case, as we have stated earlier the relevant Form 14A in respect of the transfer of the title to the appellant was a void instrument and therefore the appellant's title and interest in the Lot was indisputably defeasible. The appellant was an immediate purchaser of the Lot in question from its registered proprietor, MPM. That being the case the appellant clearly could not enjoy the benefit of the proviso to subsection (3). Once the court is satisfied that the transfer of the title to the appellant arose from a void instrument, to borrow the words of Arifin Zakaria CJM in <i>Tan Ying Hong</i>, "it automatically follows that they are liable to be set aside".</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> Accordingly, for reasons already given we would answer the question posed to us in the affirmative: "that the title of registered proprietor who was a <i>bona fide</i> immediate purchaser without notice under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code (Act 56 of 1965)</LINK> can be defeated by the non-registered valid equitable interest of an absolute assignee under an earlier sale and purchase agreement in respect of the same piece of land with another purchaser who was not the appellant".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> In the premise, we dismiss the present appeal with costs. We uphold and affirm the decisions and orders made by the High Court (which were upheld and affirmed by the Court of Appeal).</p>
