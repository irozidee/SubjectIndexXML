    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The Election Commission ('EC') of Sarawak undertook a review of the division of the Federal and State Constituencies for the purpose of election in Sarawak. Eleven new State Constituencies were proposed, increasing the number to 82 from the existing 71. On 5 January 2015, the EC published a notice on the proposed recommendations ('the Notice') in four newspapers. The publication of the Notice was to comply with the requirements of s 4(a) Part II of the Thirteenth Schedule of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. There were numerous objections to the recommendations, following the publication of the Notice. The respondents objected to the recommendations but instead of filing an objection to the EC in accordance with ss 4(b) and 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>, they applied for judicial review to challenge the legality of the Notice. The application by the respondents was made on behalf of themselves and others being registered voters of Sarawak. In their application, the respondents prayed for the following orders: (a) a declaration that the publication and/or notification of the EC under cl (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;113.;;">art 113 of the Constitution</LINK> to review the division of the State of Sarawak into constituencies for the purpose of election to the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly was not in compliance with the provisions contained in the Thirteenth Schedule and was null, void and of no effect; (b) a declaration that the proposed recommendation of the EC to review the division of the State of Sarawak into Federal Constituencies for the State of Sarawak for the purpose of election to the House of Representatives was unconstitutional and was null, void and of no effect; (c) a declaration that there was a serious and considerable lack of detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations disclosed and specified in the First Schedule, the Second Schedule and the draft Constituency Plan which were open for inspection at the places specified in the Third Schedule annexed to the Notice; and (d) a mandatory order directing the EC to republish the Notice of its proposed recommendations to review the division of the State of Sarawak into constituencies for the purpose of election to the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly, in full compliance with the provisions contained in the Thirteenth Schedule. On 15 May 2015, the High Court dismissed the application for orders (a) and (b) but allowed the orders for prayers (c) and (d). However, upon clarification called by the judge on 25 May 2015, an additional order in terms of prayer (a) was made. The EC appealed to the Court of Appeal and the respondents cross-appealed. The issue for the Court of Appeal's determination was whether the EC had provided enough particulars in the Notice to enable registered voters to make an informed decision in exercising their right to make representations under ss 4(b) and 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal; dismissing the cross-appeal): </p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In holding the notice to be bad in law for lacking in detailed particulars, the judge contradicted her own view that where such details could not be published due to sheer size, the details need not be stated in the Notice itself but must be made available for inspection at the specified places. It was therefore the judge's own view that it was not a mandatory constitutional requirement for the detailed particulars to be disclosed in the body of the notice. The EC had already done what the judge expected them to do by disclosing the detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations in the First and Second Schedules to the notice, which were open for inspection during normal office hours at the places specified in the Third Schedule. It was therefore factually wrong to say that the details of the proposed recommendations had not been disclosed by the EC. (paras 33-35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The EC had no duty to disclose more details than what they have already disclosed in the First and Second Schedules to the Notice. In the instant case, the judge had stretched the meaning of the word 'effect' in s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule beyond permissible limits. The word 'effect' in s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule meant no more than the consequence or the resulting changes brought about by the proposed recommendations following the EC's determination under cl (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;113.;;">art 113 of the Constitution</LINK>. The word had no causal link to the requirement to disclose detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations, let alone particulars of the nature mentioned by the judge. Particulars were necessary to allow registered voters to know the changes affecting their constituencies resulting from the review exercise undertaken by the EC. So long as the First and Second Schedules contained such particulars, the requirements of s 4(a) would have been met. (paras 36, 38 &amp; 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> There was no ambiguity in the words 'stating the effect of their proposed recommendations' in s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule. The words mean what they say, that is: 'to state the effect or consequence of the proposed recommendations'. They do not mean to state the adverse effect or adverse consequence of the recommendations. Such construction would be to read words into the section which are not there. For all intents and purposes, this is what the respondents implored the court to do and to which the judge agreed to. (para 41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The Court of Appeal was unable to accept the trial judge's reading of s 4(a), that it required the EC to include in the Notice, the six particulars that she had listed out in para 101 of the judgment. Even if s 4(a) required detailed particulars to be disclosed, on the facts the EC had duly complied with the requirements. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant case, the High Court judge's construction of s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule would render meaningless and superfluous the enquiry procedure prescribed by s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule. registered voters who wished to object to the proposed recommendations could then short circuit the constitutional process by going directly to the court for relief instead of going through the process under s 5(b), on the pretext that the particulars in the First and Second Schedules were not detailed enough to their liking. (para 47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The enquiry under s 5 of the Thirteenth Schedule is a mandatory constitutional requirement. It must be followed. The object plainly is to hear objections, if any, to the proposed recommendations. Contrary to what the respondents seem to be suggested, there was no requirement that a person wishing to object to the proposed recommendations must know that he was adversely affected before he could make the representations. The only requirement was that he and the 99 other persons who made up a "body of one hundred or more persons" were registered voters in the constituencies in question. (paras 49-50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> Whether or not the proposed recommendations have any adverse effect on the registered voters is a fact within the knowledge of the voters themselves and not the EC. It was unrealistic to expect the EC to provide details in such format and in such a way as to suit every individual voter's need, to be alerted of the adverse effect, the proposed recommendations would have on the voters. (para 51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Despite the respondents' complaint that the notice did not, 'give the Sarawak voters sufficient information and sufficient opportunity' to know the adverse effect the proposed recommendations had on them, the Notice attracted 64 representatives objecting to the proposed recommendations. This was sufficient proof that the Notice had achieved its intended objective, which was to inform the voting public that there would be changes to the State Constituencies due to the proposed recommendations and that they had a right to object to the changes by making representations under s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule. (para 52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The particulars disclosed in the First and Second Schedules and in the copy of the proposed recommendations were sufficient materials for the registered voters to know the effect of the proposed alterations on their constituencies, based on which they would be in a position to decide whether to object or not to any of the proposed recommendations. (para 55)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> The words 'proposed recommendations' used in ss 4, 5 and 7 of the Thirteenth Schedule connote the preliminary nature of the recommendations. The delimitation exercise is a continuous process which is eventually to be decided by the House of Representatives. It is not the function of the court to conduct its own inquiry into the objections and to come to its own decision. To do so would be to usurp the powers of the EC as provided under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">the Constitution</LINK>. (para 64)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> The respondents had not shown how the alleged shortcomings in the particulars provided in the First and Second Schedules and in the draft Constituency Plan had hampered them in the exercise of their constitutional right to make a representation so much so that their right has been rendered 'ineffective and illusory'. (para 68)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> The alleged impairment of the respondents' rights was a bare allegation unsupported by evidence. There was nothing in the affidavit in support of either respondent to aver to such fact. The respondents did not even file any representation under s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule to object to the proposed recommendations. At the date of the hearing, they were out of time to do so. (paras 69, 71 &amp; 72)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(13)</b> Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the allegation of impairment of right was a red herring thrown at the court for the purpose of casting doubts on the <i>bona fide</i> of the EC in carrying out the delimitation exercise. (para 74)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(14)</b> In the instant appeal, the High Court's refusal to grant prayers (a) and (b) of the application was a decision that was adverse to the respondents and appealable at their instance. The respondents should have filed a separate notice of appeal if they wanted the decision to be reversed or set aside, and not by filing a cross-appeal as was done in the instant case. (para 81)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(15)</b> Even if the merits of the cross-appeal were to be considered, there was nothing in favour of the respondents. The backbone of the respondents' case against the EC was their allegation that the s 4(a) Notice was bad in law for lacking in detailed particulars. This was not the case. Thus, the respondents' failure to strike down the s 4(a) Notice for being bad in law left the cross-appeal hanging in mid air without any leg to stand on. (para 83)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(16)</b> The cross-appeal was also defective in that it did not set out the nature of the relief claimed. The respondents merely set out the grounds of cross-appeal. Conspicuously missing was the prayer for variation of the decision. Litigants who seek any relief from the court, must state it in clear terms. Otherwise they might get costs awarded against them. (para 85)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(17)</b> By para (3) of the grounds of cross-appeal, the respondents were actually cross-appealing against a decision that was favourable to them. Paragraph (3) referred to the additional order given on 25 May 2015, which was the subject of an appeal by the EC. There was nothing for the respondents to cross-appeal in respect of the decision to grant prayer (c), prayer (d) and the additional order. They were already decided squarely in the respondents' favour. (para 86)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(18)</b> Concerning the High Court's decision not to award costs to the respondents despite allowing their application for judicial review, since it was a matter of discretion, the Court of Appeal would not interfere with the decision. (para 87)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(19)</b> The EC must be taken to accept the respondents' submission that since no appeal was filed against the decision of the High Court granting leave on 17 May 2015, the appeal against the grant of leave was incompetent and ought not be entertained by the court. In the instant case, the judge was right to grant leave. (paras 92-94)</p>

  <JUDGMENT>
    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Pursuant to the passing of the Dewan Undangan Negeri (Composition of Membership) Bill 2014, the enactment of the Dewan Undangan Negeri (Composition of Membership) Ordinance 2014 and the gazette notification of the amendment to cl (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_SRWK_1981_000;14.;;">art 14 of the Constitution of the State of Sarawak</LINK>, the Election Commission ("the EC") undertook a review of the division of the Federal and State Constituencies for the purpose of election in the State of Sarawak. The review was undertaken after a lapse of eight years from the date of completion of the last review. Eleven new State Constituencies were proposed, increasing the number to 82 from the existing 71.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 5 January 2015, the EC published a notice on the proposed recommendations in four newspapers, namely the English language New Sarawak Tribune, the Malay language Utusan Sarawak, the New Straits Times and the Sabah Edition of the Borneo Post, both English language newspapers. It was also posted on the official website of the EC. Published together with the notice were the First and Second Schedules annexed to the notice. The notice reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The publication of the notice was to comply with the requirements of s 4(a) Part II of the Thirteenth Schedule to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution ("the Constitution")</LINK>. To provide context we reproduce below the whole of s 4:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Thus, the procedure under s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule is that where the EC has proposed to make any recommendations pursuant to cl (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;113.;;">art 113 of the Constitution</LINK>, a notice of the proposed recommendations must be published in the gazette and in at least one newspaper circulating in the constituency, and must state the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Clause (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;113.;;">art 113 of the Constitution</LINK> pursuant to which the recommendations were made stipulates as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> As to where the details of the proposed recommendations can be found, they are contained in a booklet titled "Syor-Syor yang dicadangkan bagi Bahagian-Bahagian Pilihan Raya Persekutuan dan Negeri di dalam Negeri Sarawak sebagai mana yang telah dikaji semula oleh Suruhanjaya Pilihan Raya dalam Tahun 2014" which is displayed at the counter of the EC's office. This document, which runs into 152 pages contains the notice, the First Schedule, the Second Schedule and the Third Schedule.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Since the publication of the notice on 5 January 2015, the EC has received 64 objections from community villages, longhouses and kampongs in many State Constituencies including eight from the constituency of Baram which includes Telang Usan, Long Lama and Marudi. The objections came in many forms and they were all accepted by the EC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In her supplementary affidavit, Suriani binti Saruji who is the Deputy Director of the Sarawak State Election Office confirmed that the first hearing of the local enquiry was conducted from 26 February 2015 to 6 March 2015 and the second from 11 May 2015 to 13 May 2015. According to her, both hearings have been completed and the EC is in the midst of preparing a report in respect of the delimitation to be submitted to the Prime Minister to be tabled in Parliament.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Objection By Respondents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The respondents were among those who objected to the proposed recommendations but chose a different route. Instead of filing an objection to the EC in accordance with ss 4(b) and 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule, they filed for judicial review to challenge the legality of the notice. Leave was granted by the High Court on 17 February 2015.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The 1st respondent is a registered voter in the electoral ward of Stampin Parliamentary Constituency and Kota Sentosa State Constituency, a lawyer by profession and an elected State Assemblyman for N11 Batu Lintang. The 2nd respondent on the other hand is a businessman and a registered voter in Kampung Atip, Baram. Their application for judicial review was made "on behalf of themselves and others being the registered voters of the State of Sarawak".</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prayers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The orders sought by the respondents were the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Supporting Grounds</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Nine grounds were proffered by the respondents in support of the application and they were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Having heard arguments on the substantive application, the learned judge on 15 May 2015, had dismissed prayers (a) and (b) of the application (see para 68 of the Grounds of Judgment) but found in favour of the respondents in respect of prayers (c) and (d). No order was made as to costs. The two orders that the learned judge made were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Subsequently however, upon "clarification" called by the learned judge on 25 May 2015, an additional declaratory order was made in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>

      <b>[15]</b> By this additional order, the learned judge practically reversed her earlier decision to dismiss prayer (a) of the application, which we reproduce again for comparison:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Unfortunately no reason was given for the reversal of the decision. The reference to "publication and or notification" in the above prayer (a) must be a reference to the publication of the notice under s 4(a) as only s 4(a) is concerned with "publication" or "notification" of the proposed recommendations. There was no appeal against the dismissal of prayer (a) and prayer (b) of the application. What the respondents did was filing a cross-appeal against parts of the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We shall deal with the cross-appeal later in this judgment but we must say at the outset that the decision by the respondents not to appeal against the dismissal of prayers (a) and (b) can only mean two things, namely:</p>

    <p>
      <b>The Issue For Determination</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Of the three orders that the learned judge made, it is the additional order that defines the respondents' case against the EC. The pith and substance of the judgment is that the failure by the EC to comply with the requirements of s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule by not disclosing detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations in the notice had "abridged, restricted and or impaired" the respondents' constitutional right to have notice of the effect of the recommendations, thus invalidating the notice. This is the crux of the matter and the core issue for determination in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The appeal before us therefore turns on to the question whether the EC had breached the provisions of s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule. More specifically, the question is whether the EC had provided enough particulars in the notice to enable registered voters to make an informed decision in exercising their right to make representations under ss 4(b) and 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule. This is the theme that is repeated throughout in the judgment of the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Sections 4 and 5 of the Thirteenth Schedule envisage two types of representation, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Section 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule which is the relevant provision for purposes of this appeal is couched in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The right to be heard on the proposed recommendations is therefore a fundamental constitutional right of every registered voter. The nub of the respondents' argument both in the court below and before us is encapsulated in the following submissions by Cyrus Das for the respondents:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is patently clear from the above submissions that the respondents' umbrage is with the EC's alleged failure to disclose details of the recommendations in the s 4(a) notice as well as in the draft Constituency Plan. What the argument amounts to in a nutshell is that without the detailed particulars, the voters' right to object to the proposed recommendations is impaired, thus rendering the notice defective in law and liable to be set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Cyrus Das spoke of the "Effect Doctrine" and drew our attention to the then Supreme Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_430;"><i>Dewan Undangan Negeri Kelantan &amp; Anor. v. Nordin Salleh &amp; Anor (1)</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 430</LINK>; [1992] 1 MLJ 697; [1992] 1 CLJ 72 and the decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_186;"><i>Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Anor</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 186</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 261; [1996] 2 CLJ 771. We have heard of the doctrine of double effect but we must confess this is the first time we heard of the doctrine of single effect. These cases were cited for the proposition that where the detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations are lacking to such an extent that the public cannot exercise their constitutional right to object, then their constitutional right to make representations under s 5(b) is "ineffective and illusory."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It is a repeat of the argument before the High Court and pursued with added zeal before us. In acceding to the argument the learned judge expressed her opinion as follows at para 101 of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Earlier at paras 98 and 99, the learned judge lamented at the obstacles that the voters were facing when she said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It is unclear what the "unnecessary obstacles" were, that the learned judge was speaking of, but what is clear is that Her Ladyship was of the view that the following particulars must as a matter of law be included in the notice under s 4(a):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It was argued by the respondents that these particulars ought to be disclosed in the notice as they were known to the EC. It was pointed out that the EC had supplied such information before in the previous proposed recommendations of 17 January 2005. According to the respondents, the disclosure of these detailed particulars is reasonable having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case. It was contended that without the detailed particulars, there would be a risk that the principles of re-delineation as set out in s 2 of the Thirteenth Schedule would be ignored by the EC during the re-delineation exercise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> On the draft Constituency Plan, the learned judge dealt with the issue in the following manner at para 106:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We should perhaps mention that the learned judge had also found the EC to be acting in bad faith when they omitted to disclose the detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations, a grave indictment indeed on the EC. This is what Her Ladyship said at para 118 of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Datuk JC Fong, a former State Attorney-General of Sarawak who appeared for the State Government of Sarawak and the State Legislative Assembly, being parties affected by the outcome of this appeal, submitted that the learned judge erred in law and in fact in her interpretation of s 4 of the Thirteenth Schedule. The argument is that s 4(a) does not require the notice to contain detailed particulars of the nature mentioned by the learned judge and that all that the section requires is for the notice to state the effect of the recommendations and that a copy of the recommendations is made available for inspection at the specified places.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It was submitted that the effect of the recommendations had in fact been stated in the notice and so too was the fact that a copy of the recommendation is open for inspection at the specified places. It was pointed out that the learned judge herself at para 107 of the judgment acknowledged that a notice that does not contain the detailed particulars is not necessarily invalid if the detailed particulars are made available for inspection at the specified places. To appreciate the argument, we reproduce para 107 of the judgment in its entirety:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We agree with Datuk JC Fong. In holding the notice to be bad in law for lacking in detailed particulars, the learned judge contradicted her own view that where such details cannot be published due to sheer size, the details need not be stated in the notice itself but must be made available for inspection at the specified places. It is therefore the learned judge's own view that it is not a mandatory constitutional requirement for the detailed particulars to be disclosed in the body of the notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In point of fact, the EC had already done what the learned judge expected them to do by disclosing the detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations in the First and Second Schedules to the notice, which were open for inspection during normal office hours at the places specified in the Third Schedule. The question of acting in bad faith by hiding anything does not arise as the notice itself contained the following information in paras 4 and 5:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It is therefore factually wrong to say that the details of the proposed recommendations have not been disclosed by the EC. The notice itself does not provide the details of the proposed recommendations but the First Schedule provides the names of the eleven proposed new State Constituencies and their constituency numbers, apart from providing the names of the Federal and State Constituencies with the existing names in brackets and their constituency numbers. The Second Schedule then shows the overall effect of the changes by showing:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>The Meaning Of "Effect" In Section 4(a)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In our judgment the EC has no duty to disclose more details than what they have already disclosed in the First and Second Schedules to the notice. With the greatest of respect to the learned and experienced judge, Her Ladyship had stretched the meaning of the word "effect" in s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule beyond permissible limits. There is no mystery to the word. It must be given its popular and ordinary meaning. It is a noun which in common parlance means consequence. But if at all a dictionary meaning is required, reference may be made to <i>The Major Law Lexicon</i> by P Ramanatha Aiyar where the word is defined as:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that words in a statute ought to be construed in a way in which they will best harmonise with the object of the statute. Where the meaning of words is plain and unambiguous, judges must not read words into the statute in order to give it a different meaning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In our view the word "effect" in s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule means no more than the consequence or the resulting changes brought about by the proposed recommendations following the EC's determination under cl (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;113.;;">art 113 of the Constitution</LINK>. Contextually, the word has no causal link to the requirement to disclose detailed particulars of the proposed recommendations, let alone particulars of the nature mentioned by the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Of course particulars must be given (the proposed recommendations cannot be barren of particulars) but only so much as is necessary to allow registered voters to know the changes affecting their constituencies resulting from the review exercise undertaken by the EC. So long as the First and Second Schedules contain such particulars, the requirements of s 4(a) would have been met.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We note that there is nothing in s 4 nor indeed in the whole of the Thirteenth Schedule that can be construed as to require "detailed particulars" to be stated in the notice under s 4(a), as the respondents seem to be suggesting. These are the words that the EC themselves used in paras 4 and 5 of the notice in reference to the particulars given in the First and Second Schedules annexed to the notice. It is unfortunate that their choice of words, rightly or wrongly, has triggered a chain legal reaction that threatens to forestall the review process they are undertaking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Nor do we find any ambiguity in the words "stating the effect of their proposed recommendations" in s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule. It means what it says, that is, to state the effect or consequence of the proposed recommendations. It does not mean to state the adverse effect or adverse consequence of the recommendations. To give such construction would be to read words into the section which are not there. For all intents and purposes, this is what the respondents are imploring the court to do and which the learned judge agreed to when she held at para 97 of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> There is a distinction between a requirement to state the effect of a proposed recommendation and a requirement to disclose details of the recommendation in the sense understood by the respondents. The first is a requirement of law whereas the second is a requirement of the respondents. Failure to appreciate the distinction can lead to a serious misapprehension of the law, as had happened in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We are, therefore, unable to accept the learned judge's reading of s 4(a) that it requires the EC to include in the notice the six 'particulars' that she listed out in para 101 of the judgment. Even if s 4(a) requires detailed particulars to be disclosed, we find on the facts that the EC had fully complied with the requirement by providing the details in the First and Second Schedules, over and above their statutory duty to state in the notice the following effects of the proposed recommendations:</p>

      <b>[44]</b> In our deliberation on the contentious legal issues, we have reminded ourselves that interpreting the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> requires a different approach from interpreting an ordinary statute, in that no provision of the supreme law bearing on a particular subject should be interpreted in isolation from the other provisions.

    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The learned judge's construction of s 4(a) of the Thirteenth Schedule will render the enquiry procedure prescribed by s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule meaningless and superfluous. registered voters who wish to object to the proposed recommendations can then short-circuit the constitutional process by going directly to the court for relief instead of going through the process under s 5(b), on the pretext that the particulars in the First and Second Schedules are not detailed enough to their liking.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> It is trite principle that no portion of the supreme law should be treated as superfluous: <i>Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes (supra)</i>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_148;"><i>His Royal Highness Sultan Ismail Petra Ibni Almarhum Sultan Yahya Petra v. His Royal Highness Tengku Mahkota Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra &amp; Anor And Another Case</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 148</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Enquiry Process</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> An enquiry under s 5 of the Thirteenth Schedule is a mandatory constitutional requirement. It must be followed. The object plainly is to hear objections, if any, to the proposed recommendations. Contrary to what the respondents seem to be suggesting, there is no requirement that a person wishing to object to the proposed recommendations must know that he is adversely affected before he can make the representations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The only requirement is that, he and the 99 other persons who make up a "body of one hundred or more persons", are registered voters in the constituencies in question. It is a fallacy to think that the enquiry is only to hear objections on the adverse effect the proposed recommendations have on the registered voters. The objection could be on a proposed change in the name of a constituency.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In any event, whether or not the proposed recommendations have any adverse effect on the registered voters is a fact within the knowledge of the voters themselves and not the EC. It is therefore unrealistic to expect the EC to provide details in such format and in such a way as to suit every individual voter's need to be alerted of the adverse effect the proposed recommendations will have on them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Despite the respondents' complaint that the notice does not, to quote Cyrus Das, "give the Sarawak voters sufficient information and sufficient opportunity" to know the adverse effect the proposed recommendations have on them, the truth is the notice attracted 64 representatives objecting to the proposed recommendations. This to our mind is sufficient proof that the notice has achieved its intended objective, which is to inform the voting public that there will be changes to the State Constituencies due to the proposed recommendations and that they have a right to object the changes by making representations under s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The learned counsel for the respondents however, downplayed the representations made by the 64 representatives by pointing out that the first 20 names were of Government officials and well-placed individuals. With due respect we do not find any point of significance in the argument. We do not think the intelligence quotient of the voting public nor their status in society have any bearing on the issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The undisputed and incontrovertible fact is that some of the objections came from voters in the remote constituencies of Baram, Telang Usan and Marudi and those who made the representations included those from the constituencies of Long Lama, Selirik and Sebuyau other than Telang Usan, constituencies which the respondents claimed were beyond the reach of the notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> In our considered view, the particulars disclosed in the First and Second Schedules, and in the copy of the proposed recommendations, are sufficient materials for the registered voters to know the effect of the proposed alterations on their constituencies, based on which they will be in a position to decide whether or not to object to any of the proposed recommendations. From these particulars, a voter would know that his existing State Constituency has been moved to another Federal Constituency, for example the State Constituency of N11 Batu Lintang has been moved to the Bandar Kuching Parliamentary constituency from the Stampin Parliamentary constituency.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The First and Second Schedules also show the number of electors for each Parliamentary constituency and the number of electors for each State Constituency. This should be sufficient information for a voter to raise questions on the weightage that was given by the EC, regard being had to the rule that electors for each constituency in the State ought to be approximately equal in number as required by s 2(c) of the Thirteenth Schedule.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Purpose Behind Section 4 Of The Thirteenth Schedule</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> Having regard to the legislative scheme of Part II of the Thirteenth Schedule, it is clear that the purpose behind the requirement to publish the notice under s 4(a) is merely to kick start the process of public consultation between the EC and the registered voters. The process does not end with the publication of the notice. It is only the beginning of the process. The consultation process itself will take place at the enquiry held under s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule. This is the proper forum to thrash out any objection to the proposed recommendations, not the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> This includes, if the voters so wish, to draw to the EC's attention "a surreal tale of one bed two constituencies" that happened in Segamat, Johor in 2003 which the 1st respondent related in para 34.3 of his affidavit in support (1). It is an interesting story and we reproduce below the 1st respondent's account of the incident, and perhaps the lessons to be learnt from it:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> A quick look at document 8 of the Core Bundle of Documents, which is the "Objection and Appeal to Boundary and Name of Proposed N78 Long Lama By 100 Voters" will tell us that the procedure prescribed by s 4(a) read together with s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule does provide for an effective mechanism through which registered voters can ventilate their concerns and opposition to the proposed recommendations and to make counter proposals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> In the case of the 100 voters who filed the representation through document 8 of the Core Bundle of Documents, they expressed no objection to the proposed creation of a new constituency in Baram, ie N78 Long Lama, but objected to the proposed boundary and name. They want the new constituency to be renamed N78 Mulu instead of N78 Long Lama. They have given their reasons for objecting to the proposed change to the boundary and name. The EC is legally bound to consider the objection. The process must be allowed to take its course.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> However, the learned co-counsel for the respondents made light of the representation by the 100 voters, saying that if one were to look at the way the representation was drafted, someone must have given help. With due respect to the learned counsel, we can only describe the argument as malapropos. With or without help the law applies to all asunder, be it the village idiot or a man of the world and we say this without being derogatory.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The voters' right to object to the proposed recommendations is a constitutional right guaranteed by s 4(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule which in mandatory terms provides that the EC "shall take into consideration any representations duly made in accordance with any such notice". The question of being disadvantaged by the technicalities of the law does not arise at all. Although no one is presumed to know the law, lawyers and judges included, ignorance of the law is no excuse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> It is not hard to understand why it is made mandatory for the EC to hold an enquiry under s 5(a) upon receiving any representation of objection to the proposed recommendations. It is to give the voters, who have a stake in the election process, to argue for a revision of the proposed recommendations or even to drop any of the recommendations before they are passed into law by the House of Representatives. The EC's power to revise the proposed recommendations is provided by s 6 read with s 7 of the Thirteenth Schedule which respectively provide:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> Meaning must be given to the words "proposed recommendations" used in ss 4, 5 and 7 of the Thirteenth Schedule. These words connote the preliminary nature of the recommendations. We agree with the learned Senior Federal Counsel that the delimitation exercise is a continuous process which is eventually to be decided by the House of Representatives. It is not the function of the court to conduct its own inquiry into the objections and to come to its own decision. To do so would be to usurp the powers of the EC as provided under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">the Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> Section 5 of the Thirteenth Schedule was inserted in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">the Constitution</LINK> Amendment Act 1962 (Act 14/1962).

    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> He then concluded this part of his speech by saying:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Respondents Adversely Affected?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> It will be recalled that the respondents' application for judicial review was made "on behalf of themselves and others being the registered voters of the State of Sarawak". They say that their right, and this must include the right of all the registered voters of Sarawak whom they purport to represent, to make a representation under s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule has been impaired and rendered illusory by the EC's failure to state the detailed particulars in the s 4(a) notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Is that so? We think not because if it were so, the 64 representatives and the 100 voters who made the representations would not have been able to do so without a hitch. The respondents have not shown how the alleged shortcomings in the particulars provided in the First and Second Schedules and in the draft Constituency Plan has hampered them in the exercise of their constitutional right to make a representation so much so that their right has been rendered "ineffective and illusory".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> More importantly, the alleged impairment of right is a bare allegation unsupported by evidence. There is nothing in the affidavit in support of either respondent to aver to this fact. Neither has it been stated in the supporting grounds of application for review. The truth is, the respondents did not even file any representation under s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule to object to the proposed recommendations. They are now way out of time to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> It is obvious that the allegation is based purely on their belief that the lack of detailed particulars in the notice would have such effect, not only on them but amazingly, on all other Sarawak voters. In para 34 of his affidavit in support, this is what the 1st respondent said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> But for all the strong words, the 1st respondent failed to come up with any factual basis for entertaining such belief. Such statement of belief without disclosing the source of the belief and without collaboration from anyone who is able to confirm the belief is pure conjecture. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53;SN3.;;">O 53 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>, an affidavit filed should be for the purpose of verifying the facts relied upon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> In the present case, the respondents have not made available any evidence by eligible or affected voters to confirm factually that due to the lack of detailed particulars in the notice, they have not been able to make effective representations under s 5(b) of the Thirteenth Schedule and that their right to exercise that right has been rendered ineffective and illusory.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> if any authority is required for the point, the following passage in the judgment of Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ delivering the judgment of the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_274;"><i>Lori Malaysia Bhd v. Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 274</LINK>; [1999] 3 MLJ 81; [1999] 2 CLJ 997 at p 279, is instructive:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we are inclined to think that the allegation of impairment of right is a red herring thrown at the court for the purpose of casting doubts on the <i>bona fide</i> of the EC in carrying out the delimitation exercise.</p>

      <b>[77]</b> The words we emphasise in bold indicate that a cross-appeal is only meant for variation of "the decision" appealed against and not for variation, reversal or setting aside of any other decision of the High Court unrelated to the appeal filed by the appellant. In the context of the present case, there are two different sets of the decision given by the learned judge; one, in favour of the EC and the other, in favour of the respondents. The decision that is favourable to the EC is the decision to dismiss prayers (a) and (b) of the application and the decision that is favourable to the respondents is the decision to grant prayer (c), prayer (d) and the additional order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> The learned Senior Federal Counsel contended that the cross-appeal must be dismissed outright as it does not relate to the appeal brought by the EC. Reliance was placed on the decision of this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_3_6;"><i>Leisure Farm Corporation Sdn Bhd v. Kabushiki Kaisha Ngu &amp; Ors</i> [2015] 3 MLRA 6</LINK>; [2015] 3 CLJ 489. Very briefly the facts are these. The appellant sued the respondents for specific performance of a contract for the sale of shares and in the alternative, for damages. The High Court found that a valid and binding contract had came into existence between the appellant and the 1st respondent for the sale of the shares. The court ordered compensation <i>in lieu</i> of the order of specific performance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> The appellant appealed against that part of the decision refusing the order of specific performance. The 1st respondent on his part filed a notice of cross-appeal, appealing for a reversal of the finding that there existed a valid contract. When the appeal came up for hearing, the appellant raised a preliminary issue that since the appellant's appeal was limited to the refusal to grant specific performance, the 1st respondent's appeal must likewise be limited to that issue and that the 1st respondent could not be heard on other matters not raised in the substantive appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> The Court of Appeal decided in favour of the appellant and ruled that the 1st respondent was precluded from raising any argument that there was no valid and concluded contract as held by the High Court. The gist of the judgment is captured in the following observations by Varghese George Varughese JCA who delivered the judgment of the court:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> In the appeal before us, the High Court's refusal to grant prayers (a) and (b) of the application is a decision that is adverse to the respondents and appealable at their instance. The respondents should have filed a separate notice of appeal if they wanted the decision to be reversed or set aside, and not by filing a cross-appeal as was done in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> A closer look at the notice and grounds of cross-appeal will reveal that grounds (1), (2) and (4) are in fact appealing against the High Court's decision to dismiss prayers (a) and (b) of the application. The cross-appeal is therefore unrelated to the appeal brought by the EC, which is an appeal against that part of the High Court's decision granting prayer (c), prayer (d) and the additional order. Since the respondents did not file any notice of appeal against the decision to dismiss prayer (a), prayer (b) and the decision on costs, they are precluded from raising these issues in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> In any event, even if the merits of the cross-appeal were to be considered, we do not find anything in favour of the respondents. As we have alluded to earlier in this judgment, the whole basis, the backbone of the respondents' case against the EC is their allegation that the s 4(a) notice is bad in law for lack of detailed particulars. We have found that this is not the case. Thus, the respondents' failure to strike down the s 4(a) notice for being bad in law leaves the cross-appeal hanging in mid air without any leg to stand on.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> The cross-appeal suffers from another defect. The notice does not set out the nature of the relief claimed, which must be stated in the prescribed statutory notice in Form 2, the material parts of which are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> The respondents merely set out the grounds of cross-appeal. The prayer for variation of the decision is conspicuously missing. What the notice and grounds of the cross-appeal contain are general averments that the learned judge ought to have decided the respondents' way rather than the EC's way, and that the learned judge had erred here and there without identifying with precision which part or parts of the decision that they want to be varied. Litigants must understand that if they seek any relief from the court, they must state it in clear terms. Otherwise all they get may be costs that may be awarded against them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> By para (3) of the grounds of cross-appeal, the respondents are actually cross-appealing against a decision that is favourable to them. Paragraph (3) obviously refers to the additional order given on 25 May 2015, which is the subject of an appeal by the EC. It is perplexing to say the least why the respondents would want to cross-appeal against such order, unless it is their case that the additional order should not have been made at all. The truth is, there is nothing for the respondents to cross-appeal in respect of the decision to grant prayer (c), prayer (d) and the additional order. They are already decided squarely in their favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> As for the High Court's decision not to award costs to the respondents despite allowing their application for judicial review, we are of the view that in matters of discretion such as this, we should not interfere with the decision of the learned judge. Being the judge who heard the case, she was in the best position to decide whether costs should be awarded to any party to the proceedings. It was her decision not to make any order as to costs and we see no reason to depart from that decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Leave Should Have Been Granted?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> By para 15 of the memorandum of appeal, the EC seeks to appeal against the grant of leave to the respondents to apply for judicial review. In opposing this part of the EC's appeal, it was contended by counsel for the respondents that the appeal should be rejected outright, as no appeal was filed within one month of the decision on 17 May 2015. It was pointed out that the Notice of Appeal itself states that the appeal is limited to the decisions made by the High Court on 15 May 2015 and 25 May 2015.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> for ease of reference we reproduce below the material contents of the Notice of Appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> It is clear that the EC's appeal is confined to the decisions of the High Court on 15 May 2015 and on 25 May 2015. It cannot possibly include the decision by the learned judge to grant leave on 17 February 2015 as by then the EC would have already been out of time to file the notice of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> In the course of argument, we enquired from the learned Senior Federal Counsel if the EC's failure to file an appeal against the order granting leave would bar the EC from appealing against the decision but received no answer. Nor was any submission made either written or oral on the issue. It is obvious that the learned Senior Federal Counsel was more concerned with the merits of the High Court's decision to grant leave rather than the preliminary issue of whether the EC can be heard on the merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> In the circumstances the EC must be taken to accept the respondents' submission that since no appeal was filed against the decision of the High Court granting leave on 17 May 2015, the appeal against the grant of leave is incompetent and must not be entertained by this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> That disposes of the matter but for completeness we feel obliged to say a word or two on the required threshold for the grant of leave in a judicial review application. There is sufficient adjective law on the point. Suffice it if we refer to the speech of Lord Diplock in the Privy Council case of <i>IRC v. National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd</i> [1982] AC 617, where His Lordship said at p 643:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> Applying the above principle to the facts of the present case, we are not prepared to say with conviction that the learned judge was clearly wrong in granting leave. Given the issues raised, the lengthy arguments presented and the voluminous documents laid before her, we are of the opinion that the learned judge was right in granting leave.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> For all the reasons aforesaid, we are unanimous in finding that there is sufficient merit in this appeal to justify interference with the decision of the High Court. In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed and the cross-appeal is dismissed. The two orders that the learned judge made on 15 May 2015 and the additional order made on 25 May 2015 are hereby set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> Before we end, we would like to take this opportunity to record our deepest appreciation to the counsel for all parties involved for their invaluable assistance in the disposal of this appeal and cross-appeal. Their input has made it so much easier for us to decide on this important constitutional issue. We now invite the parties to address us on the issue of costs.</p>
