    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>In the instant case, the plaintiff filed a writ and statement of claim on 15 August 2008. Judgment in default of appearance was entered against the 13th defendant on 3 February 2009, whereas judgments in default of defence were entered against the 14th and 19th defendants on 30 March 2010. All three defendants applied separately by way of summons in chambers dated 15 September 2011 to set aside the judgments in default. The Senior Assistant Registrar ('SAR') allowed the applications on 11 June 2012. The plaintiff, dissatisfied with the decisions of the SAR, appealed to the High Court, which allowed the appeal. The defendants thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court had not erred in its exercise of discretion in allowing the appeal of the plaintiff, on the principal ground of inordinate delay on the part of the defendants in applying to set aside the judgments in default. With regard to the 13th defendant, the delay was nearly three years whereas the delay in relation to the 14th and 19th defendants was more than a year. (para 5)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Delay and tardiness in litigation have to be viewed seriously. The High Court was correct to balance the interests of the defendants against the interest of the plaintiff. This was a case where at the material times the defendants were represented by solicitors. Even though the defendants were served with the default judgments, they did not act in a timely fashion. Even accepting that the default judgments against the 14th and 19th defendants were irregular, inordinate delay without reasonable justification could still in law be a factor for the court not to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicants. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court was correct in its exercise of discretion to allow the plaintiff's appeal. However, in the circumstances of this case, this court found it fair not to make any order on costs. The defendants should not be penalised further on account, partly, of the tardiness of their solicitors. (para 23)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal was brought by three out of the twenty parties who were made defendants in the High Court, namely the 13th, 14th and 19th appellants in the intitulement (Mahanom binti Abd Karim, Ibrahim bin Abdullah, Maimon binti Abd Karim). For ease of comprehension, we will refer to the appellants in this appeal as "13th, 14th and 19th defendants" and the respondent as "plaintiff" respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The writ and statement of claim was filed by the plaintiff on 15 August 2008. Judgment in default of appearance was entered against the 13th defendant on 3 February 2009, while judgments in default of defence were entered against the 14th and 19th defendants on 30 March 2010 respectively. These defendants applied to set aside the judgments in default before the senior assistant registrar who allowed the applications on 11 June 2012 (encl 55 (13th defendant), encl 56 (14th defendant), encl 57 (19th defendant)). The applications by way of summons in chambers were all dated 15 September 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Being dissatisfied with the decisions of the Senior Assistant Registrar, the plaintiff appealed to the Judge-in-Chambers (encls 71, 72, 73) on 18 June 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The High Court Judge allowed the appeal on 21 September 2012 and set aside each of the decisions of the senior assistant registrar. The three defendants appealed against the decision of the judge before this court. We dismissed the appeal on 17 February 2014. However, we made no order on costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We were of the unanimous opinion that the learned High Court Judge had not erred in Her Ladyship's exercise of discretion in allowing the appeal of the present plaintiff, the principal ground being the inordinate delay on the part of the 13th, 14th and 19th defendants in applying to set aside the respective judgments in default. As regards the 13th defendant, the delay was nearly three years, while the period of delay in relation to the 14th and 19th defendants was more than a year.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned High Court Judge held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> As evident from the quoted passage, the High Court Judge applied the principle of law that delay is a factor to consider, and the applicants is required to offer some reasonable explanation for the delay. On the facts of this case, however, there was no explanation given for the inordinate delay, nor was there any application made for extension of time. In these circumstances, Her Ladyship was of the opinion that the applications should be dismissed <i>in limine</i>, without the need to consider the merits of the applications.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Nevertheless, even though Her Ladyship adopted the position that the appeal on account of no reasons for the inordinate delay being provided by the applicants and therefore liable to be dismissed <i>in limine</i>, Her Ladyship proceeded to consider the grounds raised by the applicants individually.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> One common thread appeared in the grounds and this was the submission that there existed elements of cheating and/or misrepresentation by the plaintif/respondent in the sale and purchase transaction relating to land that was the subject matter of the dispute between the parties: "...wujudnya unsur-unsur penipuan dan/atau misrepresentasi oleh plaintiff ... di dalam transaksi perjanjian jual beli hartanah tersebut..." Further, these applicants were portrayed as senior citizens of advanced years who lacked the physical and financial capacity to defend themselves against the claim of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In addressing the application by the 13th defendant, it was argued before the High Court Judge that it was only recently that she obtained the financial means and the opportunity to obtain legal advice: "... hanya baru-baru ini setelah mendapati bantuan kewangan serta berpeluang mendapatkan khidmat nasihat perundangan berniat untuk membela diri terhadap tuntutan yang dikemukakan oleh plaintif ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Turning to the grounds raised by the 14th and 19th defendants, the High Court was informed that both were deceased and the action had been filed after their demise. In the case of the 14th defendant, he had died seven years before the date the action was filed, and as for the 19th defendant, one year from that date. The evidence disclosed their estate was represented by named beneficiaries - Nosri bin Ibrahim, the 14th defendant's son and Mariah binti Abdul Moin, the 19th defendant's daughter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned High Court Judge found the defendants had legal representation at the material times, and further, counsel for the 14th and 19th defendants had proceeded before the High Court on the basis they had the authority to act for the two deceased defendants, stating:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The facts also disclosed that both the 14th and 19th defendants had entered their respective appearances and, through their solicitors, had applied to strike out the writ and statement of claim, but the application was dismissed on 18 June 2008. Thereafter, no defence was filed by the 14th defendant, but a defence was filed by the 19th defendant on 25 March 2009. However, the 19th defendant's defence was struck out by the court on 13 October 2009 upon application by the plaintiff. When the draft judgments in default were subsequently served on their solicitors, Messrs Norfairozali &amp; Co, no action was taken by them, and this inaction continued even after the sealed copies of the default judgments were served on the same solicitors. The sealed copies were served on 9 April 2010.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> As for the 13th defendant, the sealed copy of the judgment in default of appearance was served on the same solicitors on 17 March 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The High Court Judge also noted that thereafter the court heard the assessment of damages and the order of assessment was made against all three defendants on 21 October 2010. All cause papers were duly served on the solicitors and they attended the assessment proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In these circumstances and on these facts, the High Court Judge stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the submissions before us, counsel for the three appellants/defendants revisited the grounds of old age and senility, financial incapacity and lack of legal advice coupled with the ground of cheating and misrepresentation by the respondent. The subject matter was the sale of a piece of property identified as GM 1784, Lot 275, Mukim dan Bandar Kuala Lumpur. The defendants had been pressured into signing the sale and purchase agreements without fully appreciating their effect. The plaintiff had allegedly failed to settle even the 10% of the purchase price in full. We were implored to consider the merits of the case and to exercise our discretion in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order1A.;;">O 1A of the current Rules of Court 2012</LINK> ("In administering these rules, the court or a judge shall have regard to the overriding interest of justice and not only to the technical non-compliance with these rules") and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order92;SN4.;;">O 92 r 4</LINK> (on the inherent jurisdiction of the court to have regard to justice and abuse of process of the court).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In relation to the 14th and 19th defendants, counsel argued the default judgments were irregular since these defendants had died even before the action was filed, and no application was made by the plaintiff for a substitution order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order15;SN6A.;;">O 15 r 6A of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. A short point was made in counsel's written submission as follows: "Perayu-Perayu selanjutnya berhujah bahawa adalah mustahil bagi individu yang telah meninggal dunia untuk membela diri terhadap tuntutan yang difailkan oleh plaintif." We were referred to the Federal Court decision in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_155;"><i>Tuan Haji Ahmed Abdul Rahman v. Arab-Malaysian Finance Berhad</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 155</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 30; [1996] 1 CLJ 241; [1996] 1 AMR 215 and the headnote reading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In his summary of the submissions, counsel for the defendants urged us to consider the merits of the appeal and the justice of the case, and for the appeal to be allowed since to allow the High Court's decision to stand would be to lead to oppression and injustice. We quote some pertinent parts of the summary below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As can be appreciated from the submission, counsel purported to challenge the very validity of the sale and purchase agreements signed by the defendants in the attempt to raise reasonable merits of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We considered these submissions in detail, but ultimately the issue was one of whether the High Court Judge had exercised Her Ladyship's discretion properly in the circumstances of the case. Delay and tardiness in litigation have to be viewed seriously, and we were of the opinion that Her Ladyship was correct to balance the interests of the defendants against the interest of the plaintiff. This was a case where at the material times the defendants were represented by solicitors, who even participated in the assessment of damages proceedings. The solicitors applied to strike out the writ and statement of claim for the 14th and 19th defendants but the applications were dismissed. Even though they were served with the default judgments, they did not act in a timely fashion. Even accepting that the default judgments against the 14th and 19th defendants were irregular, inordinate delay without reasonable justification could still in law be a factor for the court not to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The governing principles are stated with clarity by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_91;"><i>Khor Cheng Wah v. Sungai Way Leasing Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 91</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 223; [1997] 1 CLJ 396; [1996] 1 AMR 846, where the court stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The applicable principles are also stated with lucidity in <i>Malaysian Civil Procedure 2013</i>, and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In the total circumstances of the appeal, and after duly considering the detailed submissions of the appellants and the respondent as evaluated against the governing principles of law on delay in the context of default judgments, we were of the unanimous view that the High Court Judge was correct in the exercise of Her Ladyship's discretion to allow the respondent's appeal. We therefore dismissed the appeal before us, but in the circumstances of this case we found it fair not to make any order on costs. The litigants should not be penalised further on account partly of the tardiness of their solicitors. The deposit was ordered to be refunded to the appellants.</p>
