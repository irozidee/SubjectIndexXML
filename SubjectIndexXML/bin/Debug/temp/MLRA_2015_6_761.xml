    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant had a main contract with one Bahru Stainless Steel Sdn Bhd ("BSS"). The appellant appointed the respondent as its sub-contractor under the main contract. The contract was <i>inter alia</i>, made subject to the laws of Vietnam pursuant to cl 21 of the main contract. The respondent subsequently commenced an action against the appellant and BSS in the Johor Bahru High Court ("JB suit"). On 15 February 2013, the appellant applied for a stay of the JB suit pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the Arbitration Act 2005</LINK> for the respondent's claim to be dealt with at the Vietnamese Arbitration Centre. The appellant obtained such an order on 11 April 2013, but was ignorant of the fact that the respondent had been ordered to be wound-up by the Kuala Lumpur ("KL") High Court on 11 March 2013. On 18 July 2013, the respondent applied to set aside the stay order in the JB suit on the basis that the appellant could not have proceeded against the respondent on 11 April 2013 when there was a winding-up order in place against the respondent on that date. The appellant conceded to the setting aside of the stay order in the JB suit without prejudice to its right to apply in the winding-up proceedings in the KL High Court, and for leave to pursue a fresh order for stay of the JB suit. On 11 December 2013, the appellant applied in the winding-up proceedings vide encl 11 for leave to stay proceedings in the JB suit and to continue with arbitration of the respondent's claims in the Vietnam International Arbitration Centre. Orders were granted by the winding-up court on 13 December 2013. The respondent however applied vide encl 15, on 8 January 2014 to set aside the orders granted by the winding-up court on 13 December 2013. On 26 March 2014, the Judicial Commissioner ('JC') who heard encl 15 allowed the respondent's application, on the basis: (i) that the appellant had not complied with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;7.;;">r 7(1) and (2) of the Companies (Winding-Up) Rules 1972</LINK> ('Winding-Up Rules') for short service of encl 11 on the respondent; (ii) the appellant's encl 11 was in effect and substance an application to stay the winding-up proceedings since the appellant could not in law proceed against a wound-up company unless there was first a stay of the winding-up order; and (iii) pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;243.;;">s 243 of the Companies Act 1965 ('CA')</LINK>, the appellant who was not a liquidator, creditor or contributory of the respondent, lacked the locus standi to bring encl 11. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal only against such part of the decision that set aside the leave granted to the appellant to continue with the arbitration proceedings in Vietnam against the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> the JC had taken a wrong approach to the issues that were before him. He had wholly misdirected himself as to the nature of the application contained in encl 11 and/or the procedural requirements in respect of such an application. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The first error of the JC was to treat the orders sought for in encl 11 as tantamount to a stay of the whole winding-up order or to similar effect. There was no basis or sound reason for the JC to come to the conclusion that a stay was being applied for or intended in so far as the winding up itself was concerned. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The orders applied for under item 2 of encl 11 were necessitated by the fact that a winding-up order had already been entered against the respondent and in the instant case, firstly there was a pending proceeding, the JB Suit, initiated by the respondent which the appellant intended to have stayed. Secondly, as matters stood at that date when the application in encl 11 was made, arbitration proceedings had already been registered by the appellant at the Vietnamese Arbitration Centre against the respondent and had to be continued. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The rationale for <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK> is to protect generally the interest of the whole class of creditors and to ensure that no further liability or expenses - including unnecessary costs - are fastened on to the company ordered to be wound-up or its assets by any future or even ongoing action brought against that company. An application for leave under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK> has to be made in the court making the winding-up order and not in any other court so that the court is aware of all such suits and exercises such authority of supervision by imposing relevant terms and conditions for the proper conduct of the winding-up process. (paras 24-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Enclosure 11 was for all intents and purposes to comply with the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK>. It was obviously not an application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;243.;;">s 243 of the CA</LINK> and the JC was in further error to have treated the appellant's application in encl 11 as one being made or pursued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;243.;;">s 243 of the CA</LINK> or was akin to that. This was a total misreading of the law by the High Court. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> It was a non-issue whether the appellant was or was not a 'liquidator, creditor or a contributory' of the respondent. Once an order for winding-up had been made, it was obligatory upon, and correspondingly open, to all third parties who intended to commence or continue with any 'proceeding' already pending against the company ordered to be wound-up, to secure leave of the winding-up court before they took any further action. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> There was no requirement under the CA, the Winding-Up Rules or the rules of procedure of the court for a third party (as was the appellant in the instant case) to apply for and be formally allowed to intervene in the winding-up proceedings as a pre-requisite before seeking or obtaining the leave required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK>. There was nothing that restricted the appellant from proceeding with the appeal, namely, to reinstate only that part of the Order of 13 December 2013 which had granted them leave to institute and/or to continue with the Vietnam arbitration proceedings against the respondent. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Any non-compliance (if at all) with the requirement of the minimum two days service under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;7.;;">r 7 of the Winding-Up Rules</LINK>, did not have the effect of rendering the orders made under encl 11 a nullity, as contended by counsel for the respondent. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;192.;;">Rule 192</LINK> of the Winding-Up Rules empowered the court to abridge any time appointed by the Winding-Up Rules and by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">r 194</LINK> it was provided that no proceedings taken would be rendered invalid by any defect or irregularity unless the court was of the opinion that substantial injustice had been caused. Enclosure 11 and relevant papers had been served, in any event, the previous afternoon on the respondent and if there was a need for further time on the part of the respondent, they ought to have firstly attended court on 13 December 2013 and applied for the same. This they did not do. Hence, the respondent's contention that the winding-up court lacked jurisdiction to grant leave was wholly misconceived. (paras 29-31)</p>

      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In order to place this appeal before us in its proper context it is necessary at the outset to make reference to related antecedents and certain prior proceedings involving the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant (Zamil Steel), a Vietnamese company, had a main contract with one Bahru Stainless Sdn Bhd. Zamil Steel had appointed GTK Berhad (the respondent) as a sub-contractor under that main contract. The sub-contract was governed by Vietnamese law and cl 21 of the 'General Sub-Contract Conditions' read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>JB High Court Guaman Sivil No: 22NCVC-433-11-2012 (JB Suit)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> By a writ issued on 11 December 2012 in the JB Suit, the respondent had commenced an action, wherein Zamil Steel was named as the 1st defendant, and Bahru Stainless Sdn Bhd, as the 2nd defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 15 February 2013, Zamil Steel had applied for a stay of the JB Suit pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;10.;;">s 10 of the Arbitration Act 2005</LINK>, and for the respondent's claim against Zamil Steel to be dealt with at the Vietnamese Arbitration Centre. On 11 April 2013, the High Court at JB allowed Zamil Steel's application and ordered that the JB Suit against Zamil Steel be stayed pending arbitration between the parties in Vietnam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> When that order was obtained (11 April 2013), Zamil Steel was not aware that the respondent had been ordered to be wound-up by the High Court in Kuala Lumpur on 11 March 2013 in KL High Court Companies Winding-Up No: 28NCC-17-01/2013, on a petition presented by one International Paint Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 18 July 2013, the respondent applied to set aside the order granted in the JB Suit on 11 April 2013 on the grounds that the said order of court was invalid and/or that Zamil Steel could not in law have proceeded against the respondent on 11 April 2013 without leave of court, as there was a winding-up order in place against the respondent on that date.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> When the respondent's application came up for disposal, Zamil Steel conceded to the setting aside of the order of 11 April 2013 in the JB Suit without prejudice however to Zamil Steel's right to file an application in the winding-up proceedings itself to obtain leave to pursue with a fresh order for stay of the JB Suit against Zamil Steel on account of the intended arbitration in Vietnam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>KL High Court Companies Winding-Up No: 28NCC-17-01-2013 (Winding- Up Proceedings)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In this proceedings as noted earlier, a winding-up order had been made against the respondent on 11 March 2013 and the Official Receiver had been appointed the Liquidator in respect of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 11 December 2013, Zamil Steel filed an application (encl 11) in the winding-up proceedings together with a Certificate of Urgency. The application was fixed to be heard on 13 December 2013 and having extracted the relevant papers, solicitors for Zamil Steel managed to serve the same on the respondent's solicitors on record then and also on the Official Receiver on the afternoon of 12 December 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 13 December 2013, neither the respondent's solicitors nor the Official Receiver were present in court but upon hearing the counsel for Zamil Steel, the following orders as per the terms of Zamil Steel's application were granted by the learned judge:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 8 January 2014, the respondent through their counsel filed an application (encl 15) to set aside the orders granted by the winding-up court on 13 December 2013. The respondent's application was heard on 27 February 2014. (Meanwhile the Official Receiver was excused from further participation in the matter after confirming that the respondent had been permitted to pursue the matter through separate solicitors).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 26 March 2014, the learned Judicial Commissioner who heard encl 15 allowed the respondent's application thereto. The material part of the orders granted by the court was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal Before Us</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appeal before us by Zamil Steel was only against part of the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner and it was expressed in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Judgment Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We have perused the Grounds of Judgment issued by the court and note that there were three dominant reasons which appeared to have influenced the learned Judicial Commissioner to allow the respondent's encl 15 application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> They were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner, it was also noted, declined to consider whether or not there were merits in Zamil Steel's encl 11 application and in this regard went on to add the following puzzling observation in his grounds.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Having considered all the material available in this appeal and the submissions of the respective counsel for the parties, there was no doubt in our mind that the learned Judicial Commissioner had taken a wrong approach to the issues that were before him and had wholly misdirected himself as to the nature of the application contained in encl 11 and/or procedural requirement in respect of such an application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Before we elaborate further, it needs to be clarified and restated that the appeal of Zamil Steel before us was limited to only that part of the court order of 13 December 2013 (under encl 11), namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>be reinstated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> It was obvious that there were two parts to the orders sought under encl 11. The first prayed for Zamil Steel:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This clearly was to intervene in the winding-up proceedings. The appellant was not pursuing any longer for an order for leave to intervene in the winding-up proceedings in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The second part of encl 11 was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> There was definitely no application in encl 11 for any stay of the winding-up order, or for that matter, for the winding-up proceedings itself being halted from taking its normal course. We agree with counsel for Zamil Steel that the first error of the learned Judicial Commissioner was to treat the orders sought for in encl 11 as tantamount to a stay of the whole winding-up order or to similar effect. In our view, there was no basis or sound reason for the learned Judicial Commissioner to come to the conclusion that a stay was being applied for or intended in so far as the winding up itself was concerned.</p>
    <p>[22] Zamil Steel's encl 11 application was only:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The orders applied for under item 2 of encl 11 were necessitated by the fact that a winding-up order had already been entered against the respondent and in this case, firstly there was a pending proceeding, the JB Suit, initiated by the respondent which Zamil Steel intended to have stayed. Secondly, as matters stood at that date when the application in encl 11 was made, an arbitration proceeding had already been lodged/registered by Zamil Steel at the Vietnamese Arbitration Centre against the respondent and the latter had to be continued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">Section 226(3) of the CA</LINK> was in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The rationale for this specific provision has long been accepted as being to protect generally the interest of the whole class of creditors and to ensure that no further liability or expenses (including unnecessary costs) were fastened on to the company ordered to be wound-up or its assets by any future or even ongoing action brought against that company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> An application for leave under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK> had to be made in the court making the winding-up order and not in any other court so that the court was aware of all such suits and exercise such authority of supervision by imposing relevant terms and conditions for the proper conduct of the winding-up process. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1999_5_275;"><i>Ham Ho Seng &amp; Anor v. Aik-Aik Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor and Another Suit</i> [1999] 5 MLRH 275</LINK>; [2000] 2 MLJ 60).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In our assessment, encl 11 was for all intents and purposes to comply with the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK>. It was obviously not an application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;243.;;">s 243 of the CA</LINK> and the learned Judicial Commissioner was in further error to have treated Zamil Steel's application in encl 11 as one being made or pursued under s 243 or was akin to that. With respect, this was a total misreading of the law by the court below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It followed then that it was a non-issue whether Zamil Steel was or was not a 'liquidator, creditor or a contributory' of the respondent. Once an order for winding-up had been made, it was obligatory upon, and correspondingly open, to all third parties who intended to commence or continue with any 'proceeding' (already pending) against the company ordered to be wound-up, to secure leave of the winding-up court before they took any further action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We were also of the considered view that there was no requirement under the CA, the Winding-Up Rules or the rules of procedure of the court for a third party (as was Zamil Steel in this case) to apply for and be formally allowed to intervene in the winding-up proceedings as a pre-requisite before seeking or obtaining the leave required under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK>. There was nothing that restricted Zamil Steel from proceeding with the appeal as taken before us, namely, to reinstate only that part of the order of 13 December 2013 which had granted them leave to institute and/or to continue with the Vietnam arbitration proceedings against GTK Berhad [the respondent] ie Vietnam Arbitration Case No: 18-13 lodged with the Vietnam International Arbitration Centre.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Finally, with respect to the complaint of the respondent that there had been short service of encl 11 and related papers on them (that is prior to the orders being granted by the Court on 13 December 2013), we need only say that any non-compliance (if at all) with the requirement of the minimum two days service under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;7.;;">r 7 of the Winding-Up Rules</LINK>, did not have the effect of rendering the orders made under encl 11 a nullity, as contended by counsel for respondent. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;7.;;">Rule 7(2) of the Winding-Up Rules</LINK> in so far was in material reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this case, the date had been fixed by the court based on the Certificate of Urgency that had been filed together with encl 11, by Zamil Steel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In any event, by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;192.;;">Rule 192</LINK> of the same Rules the Court had the power to abridge any time appointed by the Rules and by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1972_289;194.;;">r 194</LINK> it was provided that no proceedings taken would be rendered invalid by any defect or irregularity unless the court was of the opinion that substantial injustice had been caused. It must be pointed out that encl 11 and relevant papers had been served, in any event, the previous afternoon on the respondent and if there was a need for further time on the part of the respondent, they ought to have firstly attended court on 13 December 2013 and applied for the same. This they did not do.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> It is also pertinent to note here that there were four reasons cited by the respondent for the setting aside application brought under encl 15. Two were related to the issue of 'short service' and consequent alleged denied opportunity to be heard, while the other two were basically that there were no provision under the CA to vest the court with jurisdiction to grant the orders for leave as applied for by Zamil Steel in encl 11. The statutory stipulation under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK> that had to be complied with once a company had been ordered to be wound-up, has been sufficiently addressed by us above. We found the respondent's contention that the winding-up court lacked jurisdiction to grant leave to be therefore wholly misconceived. Apart from those four reasons, there was no other substantive grounds raised by the respondent in encl 15 as to why Zamil Steel ought not to have been granted the leave applied for pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;226.;;">s 226(3) of the CA</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We were unanimous therefore that the appeal of Zamil Steel should be allowed and accordingly we did so with no order being made as to costs.</p>
