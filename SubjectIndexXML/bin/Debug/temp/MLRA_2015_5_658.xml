    <p>The plaintiff sued the defendant in the instant action. The defendant filed its defence and counterclaimed against the plaintiff for the sum of RM37,127,471.60. The defendant successfully applied to strike out the plaintiff's claim and applied to have its counterclaim disposed of vide encl 151, without fixing the matter for trial. In encl 151, the defendant had prayed for various reliefs, including the payment of a sum of RM37,127,471.60. The High Court ruled that the plaintiff was liable and ordered that damages be assessed. The High Court did not order the plaintiff to pay the sum of RM37,127,471.60 as claimed by the defendant. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal which only affirmed the High Court's order on the assessment of damages. The plaintiff did not cross-appeal against the High Court's order. The matter then went to the Deputy Registrar for assessment of damages. The Deputy Registrar ruled that the defendant had not proved damages and dismissed the assessment of damages. The defendant appealed to the judge in chambers, who reversed the finding of the Deputy Registrar and ordered judgment for the sum of RM37,127,471.60 and further assessed damages in the sum of RM1,019,512. The plaintiff thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with agreed costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The order to enter judgment for RM37,127,471.60 was erroneous on the face of the record as it was not consistent with the orders made in respect of encl 151 and the decision of the Court of Appeal. In consequence the judgment for RM37,127,471.60 was bad in law and ought to be set aside at <i>limine</i>. (para 12(i))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The High Court in hearing an appeal from a decision of the Deputy Registrar relating to assessment of damages must be slow to disturb the finding of facts and assessment of damages more so when the Deputy Registrar had heard the witness and observed their demeanour. (para 13(a))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The assessment procedure and the reasoning of the Deputy Registrar passed the acid test of reasonableness. It ought not to have been disturbed by the High Court judge. (para 13(b))</p>

      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/plaintiff appeals against the decision of the High Court which set aside the order of the Deputy Registrar in an assessment of damages proceeding. The appeal came up for hearing on 13 April 2015 and upon hearing we allowed the appeal and reinstated the order of the learned Deputy Registrar dated 24 September 2012 which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>My learned brother Balia Yusof Wahi JCA and learned sister Lim Yee Lan JCA have read the judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The instant case and issue of damages has a chequered history. We do not wish to set out the entire facts as it has been adequately canvassed by the parties and also set out in the 20-page judgment of the learned trial judge. Much judicial time will be saved if the issues raised to encl 151 and encl 245 which relate to assessment of damages are dealt with in the judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiff had brought an action against Kerajaan Negeri Pahang and Pengarah Perhutanan Negeri Pahang vide High Court Suit No: 21-9-2002 and obtained judgment for the sum of RM37,127,471.60 out of the sum of RM32,723,906.6 claimed (Suit No: 22-28-2003). Subsequently, the plaintiff sued the defendant in this action for RM31,160,295.00. The defendant filed defence and counterclaim. In the counterclaim the defendant sought damages against the plaintiff and also attempted to claim the sum of RM37,127,471.60 which was the judgment sum obtained by the plaintiff in the High Court Suit No: 21-9-2002 stated above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In Suit No: 22-28-2003, the defendant then filed an application to strike out the plaintiff's claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;18.;;">O 18 r 19 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK> and succeeded leaving only the defendant's counterclaim to be tried. Without fixing the matter for trial, the defendant then made an application vide encl 151 to dispose of its counterclaim. The defendant's counterclaim reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The defendant's encl 151 reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It is important to note that notwithstanding the defendant in encl 151 had <i>inter alia</i> asked for the payment of RM37,127,471.60, the High Court ruled that the plaintiff is liable and ordered assessment of damages, ie prayer 2 of the counterclaim only. That is to say the court in hearing encl 151 did not award the sum of RM37,127,471.60 but held that the defendant is entitled for damages to be assessed. (See A/R p 961).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The High Court Order dated 16 June 2011 in respect of encl 151 is at pp 961 and 962, and the relevant part of the order read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On the defendant's appeal to the Court of Appeal, the High Court Order on assessment of damages was affirmed, and the appeal was dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The broad grounds of the Court of Appeal (A/R 725) in respect of encl 151 read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It is crucial to note that the plaintiff did not file any cross-appeal in respect of encl 151, and in respect of other prayers which the High Court did not grant, in particular the sum of RM37,127,471.60.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Upon the decision of the Court of Appeal, the matter went before the Deputy Registrar for assessment of damages. The Deputy Registrar ruled that the defendant had not proved the damages according to law. The order of the Deputy Registrar dated 24 September 2012 (AR - pp 772 and 773) in particular reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Against the order of the Deputy Registrar the defendant appealed to the judge in chambers vide encl (245), the subject matter of the instant appeal. The learned trial judge reversed the finding of the Deputy Registrar and ordered judgment for the sum of RM37,127,471.60 and reviewed the evidence before the learned Deputy Registrar and assessed damages in the sum of RM1,019,512.00. The relevant parts of the Order dated 4 July 2013 read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have read the appeal records and the able submissions of the learned counsel. After giving much consideration to the submissions of the learned counsel for the plaintiff, we are of the view that the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court dated 4 July 2013 is set aside. The order of the Deputy Registrar dated 24 September 2012 is reinstated. The defendant to pay the plaintiff's agreed costs of RM10,000.00 and deposit to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We hereby ordered so.</p>
