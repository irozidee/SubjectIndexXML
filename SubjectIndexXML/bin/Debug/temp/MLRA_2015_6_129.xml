    <p>MK Associates Sdn Bhd ("MKA") was the developer of a Golf Resort built on several pieces of land ("the land") that had not been sub-divided or individual titles issued. MKA was the registered owner of the land and sold many lots to various purchasers, including the three purchasers involved in the instant appeals ("the defendants"). The defendants paid the full purchase price and each entered a private caveat on his or her respective lot. MKA went into liquidation and decided to sell the land to the plaintiff. The plaintiff applied by way of originating summons for <i>inter alia</i> the removal of the private caveats or alternatively for the defendants to issue a letter of consent allowing for the transfer of the said land into the plaintiff's name. In respect of the first two defendants, the High Court allowed the plaintiff's application. In the 3rd defendant's case, the High Court dismissed the plaintiff's application, holding <i>inter alia</i>, that there was no need for the private caveat to be removed or for the 3rd defendant to give consent since the caveat did not prevent the transfer and requisite registration of the land from MKA to the plaintiff and the subdivision thereof. The first two defendants and the plaintiff in the 3rd defendant's case appealed to the Court of Appeal. All three appeals were heard together.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the first two defendants' appeals and allowing the plaintiff's appeal in the 3rd defendant's case with costs:</p>

      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;327.;;">Section 327(1) of the National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK> confers the High Court with discretion to remove a caveat. In considering an application for the removal of a caveat, the procedure to be adopted should be a simple and summary one. At the first stage, the court ought to examine the grounds expressed in the application for the caveat to see whether they showed a caveatable interest. Once the court is satisfied that the caveator's claim amounts in law to a caveatable interest, the court must go on to consider whether the claim discloses a serious question meriting a trial. After these two stages have been crossed, the court must decide where the balance of convenience lies. The position of a caveator should be considered as equivalent to that of an applicant for an interlocutory injunction in the context of an application for the removal of a caveat. (<i>Luggage Distributors (M) Sdn Bhd v. Tan Hor Teng &amp; Anor (folld)</i>; <i>Eng Mee Yong &amp; Ors v. Letchumanan (refd)</i>; <i>American Cyanamid Co v. Ethicon Ltd (refd)</i>; <i>Re Burman's Caveat (refd)</i>). (paras 19-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> To resist an application to remove a caveat, the caveator must show on the evidence, that: (i) he has a caveatable interest in the land; (ii) there is a serious question to be tried in the interest claimed; and (iii) the balance of convenience favours the continuation of the caveat. The onus is on the caveator to show why the caveat should not be removed. The caveator must show that the caveat has not been lodged frivolously or for an improper purpose. (paras 24-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, there was more than ample evidence to conclude that the defendants had caveatable interest in the land. MKA and its liquidators merely held the lots as bare trustees and/or constructive trustees for the defendants. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The caveats lodged by the defendants over their respective lots did not affect any other part of the land. In all their caveats, the Form 19Bs and statutory declarations clearly described and identified the caveators' interest in the part of the land that the caveators sought to protect. Therefore, there was no necessity to remove the private caveats or for the defendants to give consent for the purpose of transfer of the said land - excluding their bungalow lots - to the plaintiff or for the subdivision of the said land. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The High Court judge in the 1st and 2nd defendants' cases failed to consider <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">subsection 322(5A) of the NLC</LINK> which in effect provides that no consent of the caveator was required in respect of a transaction not affecting the part of the land. The Forms 19Bs and the Statutory Declarations accompanying the forms clearly identified the land as part of the land sought to be caveated. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> It had to be considered whether the balance of convenience favoured the continuation of the caveats. The balance of convenience is an independent criterion in assessing an application for removal of a caveat. As such, the balance of convenience may justify a court to order the removal a caveat notwithstanding the existence of a "serious question" to be tried. The defendants had to show that the balance of convenience favoured the caveats to remain. (paras 36-37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> In the instant case, the relevant factors to be taken into account in determining the balance of convenience included: (i) whether the caveators' rights could be protected by a substitute or alternative security; (ii) whether the plaintiff was being prevented by the caveats from a legitimate exercise of its rights; and (iii) whether the plaintiff would suffer loss or hardship if the caveats were not removed. (para 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> In the instant case, the subdivision exercise would not only benefit the defendants but would also benefit the hundreds of parcel owners who were claiming an interest in parcels of the said land, who, like the defendants, had been waiting for more than 20 years' for the subdivision of the said land and for the issuance of separate individual titles to the parcels without any sign of progress. (para 44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> In the instant case, the removal of the caveats would not lead to the extinguishing of the defendants' interests in the said land. The balance of convenience thus favoured the removal of the caveats. (para 45)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> The court should take whatever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong. (para 46)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> There were three appeals before the court, two from the decision of Rosilah Yop JC (as she then was) in Appeal No: W-02(NCVC)(A)-1114-07-2014 (<i>Agatha</i>'s case) and Appeal No: W-02(NCVC)(A)-1120-07-2014 (<i>Ong</i>'s case) and one from the decision of Lee Heng Cheong JC (as he then was) in Appeal No: W-02(NCVC)(A)-7-01-2014 (<i>Ng Kam Poh</i>'s case).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 16 July 2014, YAA President of the Court of Appeal directed that these three appeals be heard together as they arose out of the same factual matrix and the legal issues raised were similar. Also, the parties were the same in the three appeals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the conclusion of the submissions, we unanimously dismissed the appeals in respect of <i>Agatha</i>'s case and <i>Ong</i>'s case and allowed the appeal in respect of <i>Ng Kam Poh</i>'s case with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We are now rendering a common judgment pertaining to these appeals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> For convenience, will refer to the parties as they were referred to in the High Courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> For the brief background facts to these appeals, we cannot improve upon that provided by learned counsel for the defendants/appellants in <i>Agatha</i>'s case and <i>Ong</i>'s case and the defendant/respondent in <i>Ng Kam Poh</i>'s case in their Skeleton Submission (Hujahan Ringkas), pp 1-4. The brief background facts are in these terms:</p>

      <b>Findings Of The High Courts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        <i>Agatha</i>'s Case And <i>Ong</i>'s Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned JC only wrote one Grounds of Judgment for both cases. The court was informed by learned counsel for the defendants that the said Grounds of Judgment were applicable to both appeals as the both cases arose out of the same facts and the legal issues raised were the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned JC decided in favour of the plaintiff. Her Ladyship's principal reasons for so deciding may be summarised as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>
        <i>Ng Kam Poh</i>'s Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In rejecting the application to remove and cancel the caveat, the learned JC held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Summary Of The Defendants' Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The nub of the defendants' submission is that the High Court's decision in <i>Agatha</i>'s case and <i>Ong</i>'s case should be set aside and the High Court's decision in <i>Ng Kam Poh</i>'s case should be affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was the contention of the defendants that the onus is on the plaintiff, being someone other than the registered proprietor, to satisfy the court that it is a body aggrieved by the existence of the caveat. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_143;"><i>Eng Mee Yong &amp; Ors v. Letchumanan</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 143</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 212).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The defendants strenuously argued that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">s 322(2)</LINK> and its proviso read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;323.;;">ss 323</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">322(5A)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;136.;;">136(1)(e) of the NLC</LINK> make it expressly clear that there is no need for the removal of such a caveat as it does not affect the transfer of any other part of the said land. Further, in an application for subdivision of the whole land, there is no need to obtain the consent of the owner who lodges a caveat.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The defendants posited that the learned JC in <i>Ng Kam Poh</i>'s case had canvassed all the relevant provisions in the NLC and the applicable authorities and rightly applied those provisions to the factual matrix of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Summary Of The Plaintiff's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In considering the plaintiff's application, the learned JC had adopted the correct approach as set out in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_496;"><i>Luggage Distributors (M) Sdn Bhd v. Tan Hor Teng &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 496</LINK>; [1995] 1 MLJ 719; [1995] 3 CLJ 520; [1995] 2 AMR 969 (<i>Luggage Distributor</i>'s case).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned JC was right when Her Ladyship rejected the contention of the defendants that the caveat was only lodged in relation to the parcel and not in relation to the whole land. Her Ladyship's finding was supported by the express content of the Borang B and its Schedule. The Schedule described the land affected by the caveat in question. Consequently, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">s 322(2) of the NLC</LINK>, the effect of the caveat is, <i>inter alia</i>, to prohibit the registration, endorsement or entry of any instrument of dealing and any certificate on the Register Document of Title.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned JC was also correct in holding that the existence of the caveat prevented the subdivision of the said land. This was because the subdivision of the said land was predicated upon the transfer of the said land from the MKA to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned JC had properly exercised her discretion and correctly weighted the competing interests involved when Her Ladyship granted the plaintiff's application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Finally, the plaintiff submitted that the learned JC had correctly ordered the removal of the caveat to facilitate the transfer of the said land from MKA to the plaintiff and the subsequent process of subdivision and issuance of separate individual titles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Legal Principles</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The legal principles in relation to applications to remove caveats are well established. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;327.;;">Section 327(1) of the NLC</LINK> confers a discretion to the High Court to remove a caveat. Following obiter comments from the Privy Council case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_143;"><i>Eng Mee Yong &amp; Ors v. Letchumanan</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 143</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 212, Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) stated in<i>Luggage Distributor</i>'s case (<i>supra</i>) that in considering an application for the removal of a caveat, the procedure to be adopted should be a simple and summary one. At the first stage, the court will examine the grounds expressed in the application for the caveat to see whether they show a caveatable interest. Once the court is satisfied that the caveator's claim amounts in law to a caveatable interest, it must then go on to consider whether the claim discloses a serious question meriting a trial. After these two stages have been crossed, the court must decide where the balance of convenience lies.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The analogy of the application to remove caveat with interlocutory injunction applications can be gleamed from the following passage from Lord Diplock in <i>Eng Mee Yong (supra)</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Lord Diplock went on to state that the court's power to grant such an injunction, and similarly the order for removal of a caveat, is discretionary and that the guiding principles is the 'balance of convenience'. In this regard His Lordship said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Lord Diplock cited the case of <i>American Cyanamid Co v. Ethicon Ltd</i> [1975] AC 396 as authority for that proposition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In <i>Re Burman's Caveat</i> [1994] 1 Qd R 123, the Queensland Court of Appeal held, applying the decision in <i>Re Jorss' Caveat</i> [1982] Qd R 458, that there was no sufficient reason to depart from the principle that the positon of a caveator should be considered as equivalent to that of an applicant for an interlocutory injunction in the context of an application for removal of a caveat.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Accordingly, to resist an application to remove a caveat, the caveator must show on the evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Further, the onus is the caveator to show why the caveat should not be removed. The caveator must show that the caveat has not been lodged frivolously or for an improper purpose.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Caveatable Interest</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is pertinent to note that the foremost issue which the court must address in cases relating to caveat is whether the caveator has caveatable interest for the caveat to subsist (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_165;"><i>Kundang Lakes Country Club Bhd v. Garden Masters (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 165</LINK>; [1999] 2 MLJ 537; [1999] 2 CLJ 633; [1999] 2 AMR 2440).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Upon a scrutiny of the evidence on record, we were of the view that there was more than ample evidence to conclude that the defendants have caveatable interest in the said land. The defendants entered into the Bungalow Lot's SPA and paid their respective full purchase price. MKA has delivered vacant possession of the bungalow lots to the defendants and the defendants had been in possession the same since 1995. In such circumstances, MKA/ the liquidators held the bungalow lots as a bare trustees and/or constructive trustees for the defendant. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1974_1_163;"><i>Temenggong Securities Ltd &amp; Anor v.

      <b>Width Of Caveat</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The plaintiff contended that the caveats lodged by the defendants were wider than were necessary to protect their interests in the said land. The caveats were not only lodged in relation to the parcel but also in relation to the whole land as borne out by the Borang B and its Schedule, which is a Schedule describing the land affected by the caveats in question. In the Schedule, the caveats were expressed to bind the whole Lot No PT 1391, HS(D) No 4329, with the use of the word "kesemua". (See p 196 AR Jilid 2(I)).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In support of the submission, the plaintiff referred us to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_558;"><i>Mosbert Berhad (In Liquidation) v. Stella D'cruz</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 558</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 446 where the Supreme Court held that the caveat was intended to forbid the registration of any dealing affecting the whole land and was not confined to Private Lot No 460 only (being the lots identified by the caveator in the grounds of the caveat).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The plaintiff posited that in view of the extent of the caveats, the plaintiff would be prevented from transferring the said land from MKA to the plaintiff and would also prevent the subsequent transfer of any separate individual titles from the plaintiff to the individual parcel owners.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Now, the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">s 322 of the NLC</LINK> as amended says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Subsection (5A) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">s 322 of the NLC</LINK> states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> To our mind, the words of the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">s 322(5A) of the NLC</LINK> are clear and unambiguous and give rise to no controversy. The effect of subsection is that a caveat to bind part of the land or undivided share only, actually binds the whole of the land or undivided share. However, when an application to effect registration of competing interest or entry of a competing interest is made, no consent is required in respect of a transaction not affecting that part of the land. (See <i>The National Land Code, A Commentary</i> by Judith Sihombing, Kuala Lumpur; Malayan Law Journal, Singapore: 1992, paras [2404] and [3301.1].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Applying the above cited authorities, we were of the view that the caveats lodged by the defendants over their respective Bungalow Lots did not affect any other part of the land. In all these caveats, the Form 19B and statutory declaration clearly described and identified the caveator's interest in the part of the land that the caveators sought to protect. Therefore, there was no necessity to remove the private caveats or for the defendants to give consent for the purpose of transfer of the said land (excluding the bungalow lot) to the plaintiff or for the subdivision of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We agreed with the defendants' contention that the learned JC in <i>Agatha</i>'s case and <i>Ong</i>'s case failed to consider the subsection <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;322.;;">322(5A) of the NLC</LINK> which in effect provides that no consent of the caveator was required in respect of a transaction not affecting the part of the land. The Form 19B and the statutory declaration accompanying the form clearly identified the said land as the part of the land sought to be caveated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> That, however, is not the end of the matter. We have to consider whether the balance of convenience favours the continuation of the caveats. The balance of convenience is an independent criterion in assessing an application for removal of a caveat. As such, the balance of convenience may justify a court to order the removal a caveat notwithstanding the existence of a "serious question" to be tried.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In this connection, the defendants must show that the balance of convenience favours the caveats to remain. To do this, the defendants should show the detriment they would suffer, preferably irreparable, if the caveats were removed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It is not possible to exhaustively define factors which may be taken into account in determining the balance of convenience. For the purpose of these instant appeals, factors which are relevant include:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>(a): Alternative Security</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The plaintiff, having purchased the said land, has an obligation to proceed with the subdivision of the said land, the application for subdivision and the subsequent transfer of the separate individual titles to the respective parcel owners, including the defendants, within a prescribed period. (See paras (a) to (f), Schedule 2 of the land purchase SPA, p 237 AR, Jilid 2(I)).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> By way of originating summons, the plaintiff sought an order for the removal of the caveats and an order that the defendants issue written consent to the transfer of the said land from MKA to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The plaintiff had also offered to issue an undertaking to proceed with subdivision of the said land and thereafter to transfer the separate individual titles to the respective parcel owners, including the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In the course of a meeting between representatives of the plaintiff, purchasers of parcels in the said land and the Director of the Pejabat Tanah dan Galian Selangor ("PTG"), Dato' Kamarul Zaman bin Jamil on 17 June 2013, the PTG had even proposed to enter a Registrar's Caveat on the said land, providing blanket protection to all parties claiming an interest in parcels of the land, pending the subdivision process, which proposal was acceptable to the plaintiff, as it would facilitate the subdivision exercise. (See paras 3 to 7, pp 90 and 91 AR Jilid 2(I) and pp 363 to 364 AR Jilid 2(II)).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> It would appear that the plaintiff was encountering problems with the relevant Land Office in transferring the said land from MKA to the plaintiff. The problem was due to the position maintained by the Pendaftar Hakmilik Negeri Selangor that the caveats in question bound the entire land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the circumstances, we were of the view that the subdivision exercise would not only benefit the defendants but would also benefit the hundreds of parcel owners who are claiming an interest in parcels of the said land, who, like the defendants, have been waiting for more than 20 years for the subdivision of the said land and for the issuance of separate individual titles to the parcels without any sign of progress.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Having regard to the fact that the removal of the caveats would not lead to the extinguishing of the defendants' interests in the said land, we were of the firm view that the balance of convenience favoured the removal of the caveats. In <i>Australia Property &amp; Management Pty v. Devifi Pty Ltd</i> [1997] 7 BPR 15,235 at 15.257, the court had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We have to remind ourselves that the fundamental principle is that the court should take whatever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been "wrong". (See <i>Film Rover International v. Cannon Film Sales Ltd</i> [1987] 1 WLR 670, per Lord Hoffman).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeals in <i>Agatha</i>'s case and <i>Ong</i>'s case and allowed the appeal in <i>Ng Kam Poh</i>'s case with costs in the sum of RM30,000.00. We made no order as to costs to the Pendaftar Hakmilik Negeri Selangor. Deposits refunded.</p>
