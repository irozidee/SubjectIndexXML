    <p>This appeal was against the decision of the High Court upholding the decision of the learned Magistrate setting aside the Interim Protection Order ("IPO" granted to the appellant. The appellant sought an order that the IPO be reinstated and the matter be left to the police to complete the investigation and a decision made by the Public Prosecutor whether to charge the respondent for voluntarily causing hurt to the appellant, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;321.;;">s 321</LINK> and punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;323.;;">s 323 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The IPO was granted following a police report lodged by the appellant against the respondent, a medical doctor, alleging assault on two occasions. The respondent argued that since the parties were divorced and living separately, the appellant did not need further protection and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;;">Domestic Violence Act 1994 ('DVA')</LINK> did not apply anymore; thus the hearing of this appeal would become purely academic. Further issues to be determined in this appeal were: (i) whether the Magistrate could set aside the IPO; (ii) whether the respondent's application to set aside the IPO was made out of time; (iii) whether there was a proper case to set aside the IPO; (iii) the party who would bear the legal burden of proof in a proceeding under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B of the DVA</LINK>; (iv) whether the integrity of the police investigation was compromised; (v) the lifespan of the IPO; (vi) the proper parties who should appear in the application to set aside the IPO; and (vi) whether IPO application should be heard <i>inter partes</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal should not be used to answer academic questions. The IPO that was granted to the appellant was issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK> of the DVA. Given the clear ambit of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK>, which included a "former spouse", it was incorrect to say that the IPO only subsisted in a subsisting marriage. An IPO could still be in force even where the parties were divorced and living separately. The court therefore rejected the respondent's argument that since the marriage between the appellant and the respondent had come to an end, this appeal had become academic. (paras 10 &amp; 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">Section 4(4) of the DVA</LINK> set out the circumstances in which an IPO ceased to have effect. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">Section 12B of the DVA</LINK> on the other hand provided the mechanism for the person against whom an IPO was issued to apply, within 14 days of the service of the order, to set it aside. These two provisions were unrelated and must not be read in one breadth. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">Section 12B</LINK> stood on its own and was not subjugated to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4)</LINK>. There was nothing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> that could be construed as prohibiting an application to be made, and for the court to make the order sought, during the pendency of a police investigation. In fact the application could be made immediately upon service of the IPO. To accede to the construction advocated by learned counsel for the appellant (that only in the two circumstances falling under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4)</LINK> could an IPO be set aside) would render the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> completely otiose. That could not be the result intended by Parliament when it enacted the provision. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The respondent was two months and 18 days out of time (in filing his application to set aside the IPO). An explanation must be given for the delay and an application for extension of time must be made by the respondent. The fact was the respondent had already done that, ie explaining the delay, and this was done by way of an affidavit and the learned Magistrate accepted his explanation. It was entirely for the learned Magistrate to decide whether to accept or to reject the explanation and there was no reason to interfere with that decision. Clearly therefore it was not wrong for the learned Magistrate to entertain the application although it was filed out of time. In any event the respondent had in his application prayed for an order that he be granted leave to file the application. By proceeding to hear the application to its final conclusion, the learned Magistrate must have granted the respondent an abridgement of time to file the application. In the circumstances, there was no merit in the appellant's contention that the learned Magistrate had erred in failing to take into account the respondent's failure to file the application within 14 days after service of the IPO. (paras 21, 23 &amp; 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Having given anxious consideration to the matter, the court was of the view that it was grossly unfair and oppressive to the respondent to allow the IPO to continue hanging over his head like the sword of Damocles without knowing when it would be lifted. Having regard to the ordinary course of human affairs, it was fair to assume that the respondent had been made to suffer the indignity of being labeled a violent man although there was, as yet, no criminal charge filed against him for the assault allegedly committed. The present appeal proceeded on the basis that the investigation had not been completed. The court agreed with the learned Magistrate's observation that an investigation into an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;323.;;">s 323 of the Penal Code</LINK> should not take such a long time to complete if the police report lodged by the appellant contained the truth. (paras 34-35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Apart from the relevant provisions on burden of proof in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Chapter VII of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, there were two things in particular to keep in mind when considering who would bear the legal burden of proof: first, the temporary nature of the order and second, that the IPO was related to an allegation by the appellant of criminal conduct. Having regard to the fact that the IPO was issued pursuant to an allegation of criminal conduct by the respondent, and that the respondent had no access to the police investigation to provide proof that the police investigation had been completed within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4) of the DVA</LINK>, the burden was on the appellant to satisfy the court why the interim order should be allowed to remain. (paras 36-37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> In the present case, neither the medical report nor the affidavit of the medical officer was produced by the appellant to at least give some form of assurance to the learned Magistrate that there was a basis to investigate the matter further. The affidavit of the Investigating Officer could also have been produced by the appellant, not to prove the alleged offence, but for the limited purpose of confirming whether the investigation had been completed and if so whether any recommendation had been made to the Public Prosecutor whether to charge or not to charge the respondent with any offence in connection with the report. If even that was not possible, the appellant herself could have still affirmed to those facts in her affidavit after consulting the police. But none of those things was done, and the appellant expected the court to assume that the investigation had not been completed. (paras 38-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> There was evidence that the appellant on her own initiative went to seek treatment four days after lodging the police report and five days after the alleged assault. It had not been explained why the appellant had gone to the hospital by herself unaccompanied by a police officer, given that her police report contained an allegation of a criminal act against the respondent. The standard operating procedure would be for the police to send a complainant in a physical assault case to the hospital for medical examination and not for the complainant to do so on her own without being accompanied by a police officer. A police investigation must not only be independent but must be seen to be independent. The independence and integrity of the investigation would be compromised if a complainant was allowed to gather evidence by herself. In an assault case involving an allegation of physical injury, a medical report prepared by an independent medical officer was crucial evidence. (paras 40-42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> An IPO is a temporary order. It is not meant to be permanent. Even a protection order issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;5.;;">s 5 of the DVA</LINK> has a lifespan of only 12 months unless further extended which period shall not exceed 12 months (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;6.;;">s 6(2)</LINK>). It could not be the intention of the Legislature that an IPO should be given a longer lifespan and that it could only be cut short by the occurrence of either of the two events set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4)</LINK>. In the face of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> such construction would lead to an absolute absurdity. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that there was no harm in allowing the IPO to remain in force as it merely restrained the respondent from further abusing the appellant and that it in no way deprived him of his rights or interest in the matrimonial home. This factor, however, was irrelevant in considering whether the IPO should be set aside or otherwise. (paras 43-44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> Since a proceeding under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> was strictly a private matter between two private individuals in a domestic dispute, there was no necessity to name and bring in as parties those others mentioned by learned counsel, even if it was only to give the other side notice of the application. But if any other party wished to take part in the proceedings, it was up to the party concerned to apply for a joinder. It was not the duty of the applicant to do so. In the present case the application for the IPO was made by the Social Welfare Officer but it was done on the appellant's instruction and on her behalf and for her benefit. If at all the Social Welfare Officer must be made a party, it was for such officer to apply to be joined as a party. (paras 47-48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> An IPO once issued must be served personally on the person named in the order and will only take effect upon proper service. Once served the person against whom the order is issued can then apply to set it aside within 14 days of service. This procedure provided effective safeguard against abuse of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1) of the DVA</LINK>. Since the safeguard was already in place, the appellant's failure to apply for the hearing in the Magistrates Court to be made <i>inter partes</i> would not have prejudiced the respondent. After being served with the IPO, the respondent applied to have the order set aside and in fact succeeded both in the Magistrates Court and in the High Court. Thus, no prejudice whatsoever had been occasioned by the appellant's failure to apply for the hearing to be made <i>inter partes</i>. (paras 53-54)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal is against the decision of the Ipoh High Court upholding the decision of the learned Magistrate setting aside the Interim Protection Order ("the IPO") granted to the appellant on 5 September 2012. The appellant is now asking for an order that the IPO be reinstated and the matter be left to the police to complete the investigation and a decision made by the Public Prosecutor whether to charge the respondent for voluntarily causing hurt to the appellant, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;321.;;">s 321</LINK> and punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;323.;;">s 323 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The IPO was granted following a police report lodged by the appellant against the respondent, a medical doctor, alleging assault at 11.30pm on 29 August 2012 and at 8.00am on 30 August 2012. Amongst others, she alleged that the respondent shouted at her, hit her with his shoes and threatened to beat her up if she dared to go against him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Domestic Violence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;2.;;">Section 2 of the Domestic Violence Act 1994 ("the DVA")</LINK> defines "domestic violence" to mean the commission by a person, whether by himself or through a third party, of one or more of the following acts against his or her spouse, his or her former spouse, a child, an incapacitated adult, or any member of the family:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Thus domestic violence is violence, physical or psychological, against any member of the family and is not confined to husband and wife. At the hearing of this appeal on 14 May 2015, the respondent was present but the appellant was not as according to learned counsel, she was and still is traumatised by the incident. Learned counsel requested that the appeal be heard in her absence. The respondent had no objection. So we proceeded to hear the appeal in the absence of the appellant. Having heard arguments, we reserved judgment as we needed time to consider the issues raised by the parties. We have now reached a unanimous decision and this is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The material facts relevant to the issues are these. The appellant and the respondent were in the process of a divorce and living together at their matrimonial home at the time the IPO was issued but were already divorced at the time this appeal came up for hearing. A decree nisi was ordered by the High Court on 26 November 2014 and made absolute on 26 February 2015.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We were told by learned counsel for the respondent that the learned Judicial Commissioner who heard the divorce petition found the appellant to be 60% responsible for the breakdown of the marriage. Following the divorce, the appellant vacated the matrimonial home on 25 March 2015 and has since been living separately from the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Appeal Academic?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It was argued that since the parties are now divorced and living separately, the appellant does not need further protection and the DVA does not apply any more. It was urged upon us not to waste our time hearing the appeal as the matter has become purely academic. Nevertheless we proceeded to hear full argument from both sides.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> We have also allowed, upon request, counsel holding watching brief for the Malaysian Bar and counsel watching brief for several NGOs for women including Sisters in Islam to address the court. It is a healthy display of women solidarity we must say. The Attorney General also held a watching brief and was represented by a Deputy Public Prosecutor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The record shows that at the case management, the Deputy Public Prosecutor was directed by the Deputy Registrar to file an affidavit to confirm certain material facts pertaining to this appeal but apparently this was not done. We therefore do not have the benefit of the Deputy Public Prosecutor's assistance in confirming the actual status of the police investigation against the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The principle is that the Court of Appeal should not be used to answer academic questions: See <i>Howard v. Pickford Tool Co Ltd</i> [1951] 1 KB 417 cited with approval by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_504;"><i>Datuk Syed Kechik Bin Syed Mohamed v. Government Of Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 504</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 101. The IPO that was granted to the appellant was issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1) of the DVA</LINK> which stipulates as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The word "court" in this provision refers to the Magistrates Court, being the court having jurisdiction to try the actual offence alleged against the perpetrator of the domestic violence (see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;2.;;">s 2</LINK>). This is of course on the assumption that the police have classified the report under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;321.;;">s 321 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> There is no ambiguity in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1) DVA</LINK>. It empowers the court to issue an IPO against either the husband or the wife to prevent him or her from using domestic violence against his or her spouse or his or her former spouse or a child or an incapacitated adult or any other member of the family.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Given the clear ambit of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK>, which includes a "former spouse", it is incorrect to say that the IPO only subsists in a subsisting marriage. An IPO can still be in force even where the parties are divorced and living separately. We therefore reject the respondent's argument that since the marriage between the appellant and the respondent had come to an end, this appeal has become academic.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Magistrate Can Set Aside IPO?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We take note of the fact that an IPO, as the term implies, is a temporary order which by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4)</LINK> automatically ceases to have effect in either of the following two circumstances, that is to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was contended by learned counsel for the appellant that since neither of these two events had occurred, the learned Magistrate's decision to set aside the IPO was <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4) of the DVA</LINK>. What learned counsel is saying in effect is that so long as the police investigation has not been completed and neither has any criminal proceedings been instituted against the respondent, the IPO remains in force and the court is powerless to set it aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Learned counsel for the respondent contended otherwise. It was submitted that the learned Magistrate had full authority to set aside the IPO as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B of the DVA</LINK> empowered her to do so. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">Section 12B</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We are inclined to agree with the respondent. The fallacy of the appellant's argument lies in the fact that it assumes that only in the two circumstances falling under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">subsection 4(4)</LINK> could an IPO be set aside. Both subsection <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> it will be noted are relatively new provisions having been inserted simultaneously vide Act A1414 which came into force on 20 February 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The purpose behind these two provisions must be properly understood. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">Subsection 4(4)</LINK> sets out the circumstances in which an IPO ceases to have effect. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">Section 12B</LINK> on the other hand provides the mechanism for the person against whom an IPO was issued to apply, within 14 days of the service of the order, to set it aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> These two provisions are unrelated and must not be read in one breadth. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">Section 12B</LINK> stands on its own and is not subjugated to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">subsection 4(4)</LINK>. There is nothing in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> that can be construed as prohibiting an application to be made, and for the court to make the order sought, during the pendency of a police investigation. In fact the application can be made immediately upon service of the IPO. To accede to the construction advocated by learned counsel for the appellant would be to render the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> completely otiose. That cannot be the result intended by Parliament when it enacted the provision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Question For Determination</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On the facts of the present case, we are of the view that the question is not whether the learned Magistrate had power to set aside the IPO but whether this was a fit and proper case for the court to make such order and this includes the preliminary question of whether the application should be struck out in <i>limine</i> for being filed out of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Respondent's Application Out Of Time?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We shall first deal with the issue of time lapse. There is no dispute that the IPO was served on the respondent on 24 September 2012 but the application to set aside was only made on 11 December 2012. The respondent was therefore two months and 18 days out of time. He had however given his explanation for the delay and his explanation was that he had wrongly filed the application in the High Court instead of the Magistrates Court (see para 17 of his Affidavit in Support affirmed on 5 November 2012).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The appellant does not deny that this was the reason for the delay but pointed out that the respondent's application to the Magistrates Court after the botched High Court application was still out of time and no application for extension of time was applied for nor granted by the court. It was submitted that the delay was fatal and the application for setting aside should have been dismissed outright by the learned Magistrate without hearing the merits of the application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We cannot subscribe to the learned counsel's proposition. We do however agree with her that an explanation must be given for the delay and an application for extension of time must be made by the respondent. But the fact is the respondent had already done that, ie explaining the delay, and this was done by way of an affidavit and the learned Magistrate accepted his explanation. It was entirely for the learned Magistrate to decide whether to accept or to reject the explanation and we have no reason to interfere with that decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Clearly therefore it was not wrong for the learned Magistrate to entertain the application although it was filed out of time. In any event the respondent had, by para 1 of the Notice of Application, prayed for an order that he be granted leave to file the application. By proceeding to hear the application to its final conclusion, the learned Magistrate must have granted the respondent abridgement of time to file the application. In the circumstances we see no merit in the appellant's contention that the learned Magistrate had erred in failing to take into account the respondent's failure to file the application within 14 days after service of the IPO.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Proper Case For Setting Aside?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Now the merits of the matter. In an application to set aside an IPO under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B of the DVA</LINK>, a Magistrate is vested with wide discretion whether to allow or to disallow the application. The only fetter to the discretion is that it must be exercised judiciously and based on the material before the court. In the present case the respondent's application was supported by his affidavit in which he averred, amongst others, to the following facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> These averments of fact were traversed by the appellant in her Affidavit in Opposition but it is not clear from the grounds of judgment if any of those grounds found favour with the learned Magistrate. What is clear however is that she gave two reasons for setting aside the IPO, firstly it was unfair to keep the respondent waiting for the completion of the police investigation and secondly the appellant could avoid injury as she was living separately from the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> There can be no hard and fast rule as to what in law amounts to a valid reason in an application for setting aside under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> but we must say at the outset that the second reason given by the learned Magistrate cannot be a valid reason and is irrelevant in considering whether the IPO should be set aside. We say so simply because a person can still commit an act of domestic violence against his or her former spouse even after divorce. This is not something that is unusual in our society or any society for that matter. Parliament in its wisdom must have taken this into contemplation when enacting <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK> by including within its ambit a "former spouse".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> As for the first reason given by the learned Magistrate, she noted that as of the date of hearing, there was still no news of the outcome of the police investigation. This prompted her to make the following remarks:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It was contended that the learned Magistrate had fallen into error in placing on the appellant the burden of producing the medical report and of ensuring that the police investigation was completed. It was pointed out that since the police investigation and its progress were not within the purview of the appellant, it was wrong to take away the IPO due to no fault of hers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> There is force to the argument but in our view the matter must also be looked at from the respondent's perspective. If the police investigation and its progress were not within the purview of the appellant, neither were they within the purview of the respondent. As between the two competing interests, we would think that it is the respondent rather than the appellant who will be adversely affected by the delay in the police investigation. It will be unfair in the circumstances to allow the appellant to benefit from the delay.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> An IPO by its very nature carries with it a stigma that the person against whom the order is made is a violent person although the truth or otherwise of the police report leading to its issuance has yet to be established. The present case is a good example of how an IPO can cause injustice to the person against whom it is issued. The police report was lodged by the appellant on 30 August 2012. Yet eight months later when the case came up for hearing before the learned Magistrate on 30 April 2013, there was still no news of the outcome of the police investigation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In fact it had not been shown to the learned Magistrate nor to the learned High Court Judge that the police had in fact carried out any investigation into the report and if so what was the stage of the investigation. Before us learned counsel for the appellant could only come up with a bare statement from the bar table that there is "no evidence" that the police investigation has been completed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We fail to understand why it was so difficult for the appellant to find out from the police if the investigation had been completed or to at least update the court of its progress. As the complainant, she had every right to obtain such information, more so when the information was required for the purpose of the present proceedings, unless she took the position that it was not in her interest to obtain such information. The respondent does not have the same privilege, being the target of the criminal investigation and a potential accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Having given anxious consideration to the matter, we are of the view that it is grossly unfair and oppressive to the respondent to allow the IPO to continue hanging over his head like the sword of democles without knowing when it would be lifted. Having regard to the ordinary course of human affairs, it is fair to assume that the respondent has been made to suffer the indignity of being labelled a violent man although there is, as yet, no criminal charge filed against him for the assault allegedly committed in August 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The present appeal proceeded on the basis that the investigation has not been completed, and we are now into the second half of 2015. How much longer, one may ask, will the police take to complete the investigation, if at all any investigation has been carried out? We agree with the learned Magistrate's observation that an investigation into an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;323.;;">s 323 of the Penal Code</LINK> should not take such a long time to complete if the police report lodged by the appellant contained the truth.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Burden Of Proof</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The appellant had posed the question, who bears the burden of proof in a proceeding under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B of the DVA</LINK>? Apart from the relevant provisions on burden of proof in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Chapter VII of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, there are two things in particular that we need to keep in mind when considering this question, first the temporary nature of the order and second that the IPO relates to an allegation of criminal conduct by the appellant. It is settled criminal jurisprudence that he who accuses must prove the accusation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In saying this we are of course not suggesting that the interest of the respondent takes priority over the interest of the appellant. Obviously a balance has to be struck between the two competing interests. All things said and done and having regard to the fact that the IPO was issued pursuant to an allegation of a criminal conduct by the respondent, and that the respondent had no access to the police investigation to provide proof that the police investigation had been completed within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4)</LINK>, we take the view that the burden is on the appellant to satisfy the court why the interim order should be allowed to remain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In the present case, neither the medical report nor the affidavit of the medical officer was produced by the appellant to at least give some form of assurance to the learned Magistrate that there was basis to investigate the matter further. The affidavit of the Investigating Officer could also have been produced by the appellant, not to prove the alleged offence, but for the limited purpose of confirming whether the investigation had been completed and if so whether any recommendation had been made to the Public Prosecutor whether to charge or not to charge the respondent with any offence in connection with the report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> if even that was not possible, the appellant herself could still affirm to those facts in her affidavit after consulting the police. But none of these was done, and the appellant expects the court to assume that the investigation has not been completed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Integrity Of Police Investigation Compromised?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> There is evidence that the appellant on her own initiative went to Hospital Raja Permaisuri Bainun, Ipoh to seek treatment four days after lodging the police report and five days after the alleged assault. It has not been explained why the appellant had gone to the hospital by herself and not accompanied by any police officer, given that her police report contained an allegation of a criminal act against the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We believe the standard operating procedure would be for the police to send a complainant in a physical assault case to the hospital for medical examination and not for the complainant to do so on her own without being accompanied by any police officer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The reason for this is obvious. A police investigation must not only be independent but must be seen to be independent. The independence and integrity of the investigation will be compromised if a complainant is allowed to gather evidence by herself. In an assault case involving an allegation of physical injury, a medical report prepared by an independent medical officer is crucial evidence to determine if the complainant has indeed suffered any injury, if so how serious is the injury, on which part of the body was the injury inflicted and so on and so forth.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Lifespan Of IPO</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As we said, an IPO is a temporary order. It is not meant to be permanent. Even a protection order issued pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;5.;;">s 5 DVA</LINK> has a lifespan of only 12 months unless further extended which period shall not exceed 12 months: See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;6.;;">s 6(2)</LINK>. It cannot be the intention of the Legislature that an IPO should be given a longer lifespan and that it could only be cut short by the occurrence of either of the two events set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(4)</LINK>. In the face of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> such construction will lead to an absolute absurdity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant argued that there is no harm in allowing the IPO to remain in force as it merely restrains the respondent from further abusing the appellant and that it in no way deprives him of his rights or interest in the matrimonial home. With due respect, we do not see the relevance of this factor in considering whether the IPO should be set aside or otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In any event, even without the protection accorded by the IPO, there are other laws that can provide adequate protection to the appellant. One such law is the Penal Code itself. Surely it will be a criminal offence under the Penal Code if the respondent were to commit any violent act or threat of violence against the appellant. If that were to happen, the appellant is at liberty to lodge a fresh police report against the respondent. Not all is lost merely because no IPO is in place. The sad reality is that if a person is violent by nature, he will still commit domestic violence irregardless, with or without an IPO.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Proper Parties Before The Court?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant posed the questions: Who are the proper parties to an application to set aside an IPO? Ought the application be served on the police, the Public Prosecutor and the Social Welfare Officer? Should they be made parties? The DVA unfortunately is silent on the procedure with regard to these matters.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In our view, since a proceeding under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> is strictly a private matter between two private individuals in a domestic dispute, there is no necessity to name and bring in as parties those others mentioned by learned counsel, even if it is only to give the other side notice of the application. But if any other party wishes to take part in the proceedings, it is up to the party concerned to apply for a joinder. We do not think it is the duty of the applicant to do so. All that he is interested in is to have the order set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> It is true that in the present case the application for the IPO was made by the Social Welfare Officer but it was done on the appellant's instruction and on her behalf and for her benefit. If at all the Social Welfare Officer must be made a party, it is for such officer to apply to be joined as a party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether IPO Application To Be Heard <i>Inter Partes</i>?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The respondent on his part raised the point that the appellant should have applied for the hearing in the Magistrates Court to be made inter partes and that her failure to do so had prejudiced him in that he was given no opportunity to ventilate his case before the IPO was extended beyond 21 days. It was submitted that since an IPO is a form of interim injunction obtained by way of an <i>ex parte</i> application, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29;SN1.;;">O 29 r 1(1)(2B)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29;SN1.;;">O 29 r 1(1)(2BA) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> ("the Rules") would take effect. We reproduce below <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29;SN1.;;">O 29 r 1(1)(2B)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29;SN1.;;">O 29 r 1(1)(2BA)</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> There are no equivalent provisions in the DVA but <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;1;SN2.;;">O 1 r 2(2) of the Rules</LINK> expressly provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In the light of this provision, we agree with learned counsel for the appellant that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29.;;">O 29 of the Rules</LINK> has no application. The procedure has been prescribed by the DVA itself, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK> for the grant of the IPO and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;12B.;;">s 12B</LINK> for the setting aside of the order. Whilst we agree that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29.;;">O 29 of the Rules</LINK> does not apply, there appears to be a lacuna in the law as to what happens to an IPO if it is not set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> There is no provision in the DVA to prescribe its lifespan unlike <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29;SN1.;;">O 29 r 1(1) (2B) of the Rules</LINK> which stipulates that an interim injunction order obtained on <i>ex parte</i> application automatically lapses twenty one days from the date it was granted unless earlier revoked or set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> An IPO once issued must be served personally on the person named in the order and will only take effect upon proper service. Once served the person against whom the order is issued can then apply to set it aside within 14 days of service. To our mind this procedure provides effective safeguard against abuse of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1994_521;4.;;">s 4(1)</LINK>. For all practical purposes it is similar to the safeguard provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;29;SN1.;;">O 29 r 1(1)(2BA) of the Rules </LINK> except that it is for the person against whom the order is issued to make the application to set it aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> Since the safeguard is already in place, we do not see how the appellant's failure to apply for the hearing in the Magistrates Court to be made <i>inter partes</i> had prejudiced the respondent. The truth of the matter is, after being served with the IPO the respondent applied to have the order set aside and in fact succeeded both in the Magistrates Court and in the High Court. Thus no prejudice whatsoever had been occasioned by the appellant's failure to apply for the hearing to be made <i>inter partes</i>. The point raised by the respondent is therefore without substance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Whether Appellant To Pay Costs In The High Court?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Lastly, counsel for the appellant questioned why costs in the sum of RM600 should be awarded against the appellant by the High Court after dismissing her appeal. Again this is a matter of discretion and we shall say no more.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Summation And Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> To recapitulate, the law allows for an IPO to be set aside on application and in this case the learned Magistrate after considering the respondent's application and the appellant's opposition thereto decided that the IPO should be set aside. It is not for us sitting in our appellate jurisdiction to differ from the learned Magistrate unless it can be shown that the way in which she exercised the discretion was manifestly wrong: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_143;"><i>Eng Mee Yong &amp; Ors v. Letchumanan</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 143</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 212.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We are not convinced that the learned Magistrate had erred in the exercise of her discretion. Her error in finding that the IPO was no longer needed because the appellant could avoid injury as she was living separately from the respondent is not such a manifest error as to render the whole of her judgment defective and liable to be set aside. Nor do we think the learned High Court Judge was wrong in affirming her decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> For all the reasons aforesaid, we are unanimous in finding that there is no merit in the appellant's appeal. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs. We shall now proceed to hear the parties on costs.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
