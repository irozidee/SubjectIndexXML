    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant's claim arose out of its discovery upon an inspection that the respondent's electricity meter had been tampered with. As a result of the tampering, the meter had failed to record the correct usage of electricity at the respondent's premises. The appellant calculated that for the period from 1 September 2006 to 15 May 2008, usage amounting to RM443,598.77 was not recorded. The respondent failed to settle the amount and the appellant sued to recover the amount in the High Court. The High Court dismissed the appellant's action, and the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The issues for the Court of Appeal herein were <i>inter alia</i>: (i) whether a document - P2 - was admissible as evidence, even though the officer who had keyed in the data in that document was not called to testify and neither was any certificate tendered under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>; (ii) whether the appellant had proved the quantum of its loss; and (iii) whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 ("the Act")</LINK> - pertaining to the appellant's right to recover loss of revenue - was applicable only where the consumer had been charged and convicted of an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37(1), (3) or (14) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> PW2's testimony explained lucidly how the estimates were arrived at. PW2 was clearly a person with the necessary knowledge of how the estimates were calculated. In the instant case, the failure to call as a witness the person who keyed in the data (into P2) should not attract adverse inferences. Whether or not a particular adverse inference is drawn must necessarily be drawn from the nature, relevance and the surrounding circumstances, and not solely from the failure alone. (paras 22-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> P2 demonstrated how an estimate was arrived at in calculating backcharges to be imposed. An estimate, compared to actual evidence, would appear as sketchy, hazy and confusing. If the estimate resulted in imposing an additional charge of 27% to what had been billed and paid, it was not so necessarily beyond the bounds of reasonability that it must be rejected. If it was established that a meter had been tampered with and its readings did not reflect the actual consumption of electricity, and the additional charge or back charge imposed upon the consumer was not demonstrated to be manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong, the amount due was proved upon a balance of probabilities. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant, upon whom the burden of proof lay to prove its case upon a balance of probabilities, had adduced evidence of the estimate and how it was arrived at. The burden thus shifted to the respondent to show that the estimate was in fact manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong. However, there was a lack of evidence to show that the estimate of 27% was manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong. Thus the High Court should have held that the amount claimed as the estimate had been successfully proven upon a balance of probabilities. (paras 29-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> A licensee does not require <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> of the Act to ground a cause of action against a consumer for losses suffered from the tampering of the consumer's electricity meter. All that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> does is to enable the licensee to rely on a conviction, if any, obtained by the prosecutor, and as provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(5)</LINK>, to rely upon the written statement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the loss of revenue suffered and the consumer liable for the payment thereof.

    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 21 February 2011, the High Court dismissed the claim by the plaintiff Tenaga Nasional Berhad ("the appellant") against the defendant AWP Enterprise (M) Sdn Bhd ("the respondent").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent is the registered user of the account 0-12100512670 for the supply of electricity to its premises at Lot 9672, Jalan Desa Aman 13, Batu 11, Jalan Kuala Selangor, 47000 Desa Aman Sungai Buloh, Selangor Darul Ehsan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Having heard the parties, this court allowed the appeal, entered judgment for the appellant in terms of the prayers (a) and (b) at para 16 of its statement of claim with costs fixed at RM30,000.00 here and below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant's claim arose out of the discovery upon an inspection conducted at 11.10pm on 15 May 2008 that the meter had been tampered with. The inspection was conducted in the presence of the respondent. It was found that as a result of the tampering, the meter failed to record the correct usage of electricity. The meter was repaired by the appellant, who lodged a police report DESA JAYA/00317 8/08 on 16 May 2008. It was calculated that for the period from 1 September 2006 to 15 May 2008, usage amounting to RM443,598.77 was not recorded. The respondent failed to settle this amount and litigation was commenced to recover:</p>

      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In its grounds of judgment, the High Court summed up the appellant's claim, the respondent's defence, the appellant's case and witnesses' testimony, the respondent's case and witnesses before proceeding to its finding and analysis on the issue of tampering, whether the tampering was carried out by the respondent, burden on the respondent as defendant on facts asserted in support of the defence, absence of notice for the intended inspection, the relationship between the respondent and Bright Rims, that all monthly bills issued had been settled by the defendant, whether the appellant had proved the quantum of its loss, findings and analysis on the issue of quantum, issues of law on the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;;">Electricity Supply Act 1990 ("Act 447")</LINK> and the Licensee Supply Regulations 1990 ("PU(A) 384/1990"), the effect of reg 11(2) of PU(A) 384/1990, and holding that reg 11(2) limits claims for back charges one to three months from the date of the service of notice to the consumer of such undercharges, that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(3) of Act 447</LINK> applies only where that consumer has been charged and convicted of any such offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">subsection 37(1), (3) or (14)</LINK>. The High Court dismissed the appellant's claim with costs of RM25,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal Before This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Eleven grounds were set out in the memorandum of appeal and addressed in the written submissions for the appellant. For the respondent, the submissions were presented as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Consideration And Conclusions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It was submitted by the respondent that in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_432;"><i>Sivalingam Periasamy v. Periasamy &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 432</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 395; [1996] 4 CLJ 545; [1996] 3 AMR 3506, a decision of the Court of Appeal, it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We observe the quotation is incomplete. The Court of Appeal in fact held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The reason for reluctance by an appellate court to intervene with the findings of a trial court is that the parties had the opportunity to analyse pleadings as to what facts are relied upon, of those facts what are and what are not disputed. Where facts are disputed but the disputing party did not utilise the process of interrogatories and discovery to check and verify the facts, it must be concluded that the dispute was a bare dispute or denial, and it is unfair and unjust to allow a second bite of the cherry. Indeed, only when in respect of a disputed fact in a trial court a dispute remains after the evidence relied upon has been checked and verified by the parties, does it warrant the time of the trial court to hear, and evaluate the evidence, and to consider the submissions thereon. But where on the spur of the moment, off the cuff or impromptu questions are asked without prior checking is objected to, the trial court is entitled to disallow the questioning on the grounds that it is unsafe and unfair to rely upon the answers as the other party had not had the opportunity to check and verify it. The objective of trial remains always to get the facts right by giving parties the opportunity to check and verify every dispute. A trial is not a refereeing of a contest of words to be won by <i>argumentum ad hominems</i> and surprises. Decisions in such cases cannot be described as judicial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The trial court, a court of first instance, has the advantage over an appellate court in the assessment of the relative credibility of oral evidence, in other words, of the witnesses who testified and were tested on their testimony before the trial court. The trial court is said to have an audio visual advantage in respect of the assessment of oral evidence or testimony to determine whether it is safe to rely upon the evidence of one witness rather than another witness or other evidence. But that advantage is an advantage only if it is prevailed upon, in other words if facts from audio or visual observations of the judge are set out in the grounds of decision as reasons for accepting the evidence of one witness rather than other evidence or witness. If no such reasons are set out, it means the trial court did not rely upon the audio visual advantage, but merely made evaluation of the content of his testimony against other evidence. In such a case, the appellate court is in the same position as the trial court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Scrutiny of the grounds of judgment offered no excuse to hold intervention is not possible because of any audio visual advantage depended upon by the trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> This case concerned electricity supply. We bear in mind:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The High Court did not err in applying common sense to hold that giving notice before an inspection makes the inspection an act of futility. Further, once tampering is established, the party who did so is, upon a balance of probabilities, the consumer who pays the electricity bill. Who else would gain by doing so? The arguments as to who actually used the electricity, and the giving of notice before an inspection, are arguments with no merit, and probably only to lead the trial astray from focusing on the relevant issues. Likewise, the argument that electricity bills had been regularly paid as billed every month. What difference does that make as the meter reader merely reads what the meter shows. It does not preclude that the meter was not recording actual consumption. The germane question is how to determine the amount of electricity consumed when a meter has been tampered not to read it or to read it correctly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> For the electricity supplier, it is impossible to turn back the clock and remeter the consumption. The determination is necessarily by an estimate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was held by the High Court, relying upon <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_58;"><i>Ahmad Najib Aris v. PP</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 58</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 613; [2009] 2 CLJ 800 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_1_251;"><i>Malayan Banking Bhd v. Dr Betharajoo Krishnasamy</i> [2000] 1 MLRH 251</LINK>; [2000] 3 MLJ 391; [2000] 3 CLJ 141, that the appellant should have either called the officer who had keyed in the data to testify or to produce a certificate under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> from an officer of the appellant who is responsible for the management of the computer that these documents were prepared from the plaintiff 's computer in the course of its ordinary use.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">Section 90A of the Evidence Act 1950 (Act 56)</LINK> provides admissibility of documents produced by computers, and of statements contained therein:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> There was no certificate under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A</LINK> and therefore the appellant could not prevail upon the provisions relating to the weight that can be attached to the document.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The High Court considered the evidence of PW2:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> On perusal, we find that PW2's testimony explained lucidly how the estimates were arrived at. He was clearly a person with the necessary knowledge of how the estimates are calculated. Whether the data in the computer is correct is another matter. It is possible that data had not been correctly read and collected, or that the data had been wrongly keyed in.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The relevance of the reasoning that the person who keyed in the data should have been called must be tested against the purpose for which the person is to be called. Essentially calling a witness to testify is to give the respondent an opportunity, in this case, to put the question whether the witness keyed in the data correctly. If such witness admitted the possibility of errors in keying in the data, it does not address the accuracy of the data in the first place. In our view, the failure to call as witness the person who keyed in the data should not attract adverse inferences. While the law permits the drawing of adverse inferences from certain failures, whether or not a particular adverse inference is drawn must necessarily be drawn from the nature, relevance and the surrounding circumstances, and not solely from the failure alone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The germane consideration, in our view, is that the document demonstrates how an estimate is arrived at in calculating back charges to be imposed. An estimate, compared to actual evidence will appear as sketchy, hazy and confusing. Statistical mathematics and analysis is not a subject within the expertise of lawyers and judges. If the estimate results in imposing an additional charge of 27% to what had been billed and paid, it is not so necessarily beyond the bounds of reasonability that it must be rejected. In our view, if it is established that a meter had been tampered with and its readings does not reflect the actual consumption of electricity, and the additional charge or back charge imposed upon the consumer is not demonstrated to be manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong, the amount due is proved upon a balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In the final analysis:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1975_1_555;"><i>International Investment Ltd v. Comptroller-General Of Inland Revenue</i> [1975] 1 MLRA 555</LINK>; [1973] 2 MLJ 10, Raja Azlan FJ (as His Majesty then was) had occasion to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> This was referred to by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_714;"><i>ALF Properties Sdn Bhd v. Ketua Pengarah Jabatan Hasil Dalam Negeri</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 714</LINK>; [2005] 5 MLJ 717; [2005] 3 CLJ 936; [2005] 6 AMR 709.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Likewise, excessive demands on technicality and specific evidence as proof overlooks other relevant facts and evidence. That it results in benefiting the wrongdoer is a greater inequity and injustice than the wrongdoer having to pay a back charge upon an estimate that is not shown to be manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The appellant, upon whom the burden of proof lay to prove its case upon a balance of probabilities, having adduced evidence of the estimate and how it is arrived at, the burden shifts to the respondent to show that the estimate is in fact manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> That the electricity bills subsequent to the repairs having been effected after the tampering was discovered, are "roughly the same", is on the face of it a relevant consideration, but only so provided it is established the actual consumption of electricity remained the same. This is because reduced consumption, such as by monitoring wastage or improved and more efficient equipment, or reduced production due to adverse markets, would also keep the post tamper-repair electricity bills down.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The party in whose hands is the evidence from which actual usage may be derived is the consumer. Equipment used and their wattage specifications are in the hands of the consumer. The hours of use may be recorded, or may be estimated by correlation with the product and quantities produced, or the manhours used to determine wages and allowances for workers. These are evidence in the respondent's records. We find the evidence before the court lacking in showing that the estimate of 27%, totalling RM443,598.77 for about 191/2 months (or about RM22,750.00 per month) was manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We, therefore, hold that the High Court should have held that the claimed amount of RM443,598.77 as an estimate that is not manifestly unreasonable, excessive or wrong has been successfully proved upon a balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We turn to the question of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> It arises from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">ss 37</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">38 of Act 447</LINK>, and reg 11(2) the PU(A) 384/1990. The question is whether taking into consideration reg 11(2), a conviction under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK> for tampering is a necessary precondition to a claim made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4) of Act 447</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[38]</b> The first literal interpretation results in an apparent absurdity that the licensee is denied the right to claim for the loss unless there is a conviction by a third party, the prosecutor, and a consumer who tampered with the meter is not obliged to pay if it is not convicted of an offence. Such a literal interpretation not only alters the standard of proof to recover outstanding payments due from upon a balance of probabilities to proof beyond reasonable doubt, but also upon the proving of the case by a third party, the prosecutor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The inequity and injustice from such a literal interpretation is also evident from a slightly different angle. It may be said that the remedy to losses from tampering is to eliminate tampering itself. To eliminate tampering altogether is, however, well-nigh impossible. It arises from the honesty or lack thereof of the consumer in whose premises the meter is necessarily located to record his consumption of electricity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The alternative is steps to minimise such offences. To minimise tampering, for example, with monthly inspections, would increase the costs that will only be passed on to consumers. Is it fair that consumers be effectively penalised by having to pay higher costs because of the acts of those who try to benefit by tampering with the meters. Are they also to be doubly rewarded by limiting claims for back charges only to when they are successfully convicted, ie the case against them is proved beyond reasonable doubt, when the burden of proof in a civil claim is upon a balance of probabilities? Who has ever heard of a third party entering a consumer's premises, and tamper with the meter to the benefit of the consumer? It cannot be overlooked that the meter is located in the consumer's premises to record electricity consumption in the premises. Is it rightly suggested that he need not pay for what he had consumed on the argument that through no fault of his, the amount consumed could not be metered?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The question follows: Should the court apply an interpretation that makes Parliament look incompetent, and makes the courts appear to be dancing with those who benefit from tampering? The second interpretation would not interfere with the licensee's rights to seek and recover payments for electricity supplied and consumed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Furthermore, it is trite that statutory interpretation is to give effect to the statute according to the intent of Parliament. An absurdity cannot be the intent of Parliament. Hence, if a literal interpretation results in an absurdity, then an interpretation is applied so that it enables the intent to be realised. Such an interpretation has been termed a purposive interpretation. Regardless of whether the interpretation is "literal" and "purposive", the objective is to give effect to the statute according to the intent of Parliament without any absurdity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> On the most basic level, a licensee does not require <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> for a cause of action against a consumer for losses suffered from tampering of the electricity meter recording the consumer's consumption of electricity. We bear in mind that the licensee has neither authority to prosecute nor control over prosecutions for offences under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;37.;;">s 37</LINK>. All that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> does therefore is to enable the licensee to rely on a conviction, if any, obtained by the prosecutor, and as provided by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(5)</LINK>, to rely upon the written statement under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;38.;;">s 38(4)</LINK> as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the loss of revenue suffered and the consumer liable for the payment thereof.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The reg 11 of PU(A) 384/1990, made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_447;53.;;">s 53 of Act 447</LINK>, provides:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The effect of reg 11(2) is to extend a similar power to make adjustments to the payments due arising from undercharging or overcharging as a result of meter inaccuracy, malfunctioning of the meter or its associated installation or part thereof, incorrect meter reading; incorrect application of a meter multiplying constant, cross-connection of installation to different accounts or faulty installation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we allowed the appeal and made the orders set out in para 3 above.</p>
