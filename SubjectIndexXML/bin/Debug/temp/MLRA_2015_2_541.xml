    <p>On 23 May 2012, officers of the 1st appellant, without warrant, prior notice or objection, conducted a search at a bookstore belonging to the 1st respondent ("the bookstore") and seized several books ("the books"). The officers came to the bookstore with a group of reporters and photographers. The officers of the 1st appellant then examined the 2nd respondent - a non-Muslim and the General Manager Operations and Merchandising of the 1st respondent - and the 3rd respondent - a Muslim, the bookstore manager and employee of the 1st respondent. Both the 2nd and 3rd respondents were then issued orders compelling them to be present at the 1st appellant's office for further examination and investigation. When the 2nd and 3rd respondents attended the office of the 1st appellant on 30 May 2012, the 3rd respondent was arrested and charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the Syariah Criminal Offences (Federal Territories) Act 1997 ("the SCO Act")</LINK> for the offence of "disseminating and distributing by way of selling the books deemed contrary to Hukum Syarak". At the time of the search and seizure of the books by the 1st appellant's officers, ie on 23 May 2012, the books were not subject to any Prohibition Order issued by the 2nd appellant. Neither was there any fatwa, declaration, announcement or circular issued by the 1st appellant or by any other religious authority banning the publication and sale of the books on the ground that the books were in breach of Hukum Syarak. Further, the 3rd respondent was not in any way responsible for the selection of the books for sale at the 1st appellant's bookstore. On 29 May 2012 - almost a week after the search and seizure of the books, the 2nd appellant issued a Prohibition Order, published vide Gazette Notification PU(A) 162 on 14 June 2012, known as the Printing Presses and Publications (Control of Undesirable Publications) (No 3) Order 2012 under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 ("the PPP Act")</LINK>, banning the publication and sale of the said books. On 18 June 2012, the respondents applied for leave for judicial review and served cause papers on the appellants. The application was heard <i>inter partes</i> on 25 June 2012 and notwithstanding the appellants' contention that the High Court had no jurisdiction to hear the judicial review application, the High Court allowed the respondents leave. The appellants did not appeal against the decision on granting leave. The High Court subsequently allowed the appellants' application for judicial review and granted the declarations and <i>certiorari</i> orders prayed for. The appellants thus appealed to the Court of Appeal. In the Court of Appeal, the two main grounds of appeal pursued by the appellants were: (i) the High Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the judicial review; and (ii) the High Court judge erred in law and in fact in allowing the judicial review application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The appellants did not appeal against the decision of the High Court judge on the grant of leave thereby impliedly or expressly conceding that the High Court did have jurisdiction in the matter and that the decision of the judge was a final order in the circumstances. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> While the threshold in an application for leave for judicial review may be lower in terms of facts, the threshold on matters of law is the same as in the hearing of the judicial review itself. This is because the issue of jurisdiction of the court goes to the root of the matter before the court. It is a fundamental issue. It cannot be that a question of law will be decided on a lower standard in a leave application and then the same issue decided again but on a higher standard in the full judicial review hearing. (para 40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court judge could not, after having granted leave in the leave application on the basis that the High Court was seized with jurisdiction, change her mind, overrule her decision and rule that the High Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the substantive judicial review application. In the instant case, there were no prevailing circumstances to justify the reopening of the issue of jurisdiction given that the issue had been fully canvassed before the judge and that the appellants had chosen not to appeal against the said decision. The appellants could not at the instant appeal raise the issue of lack of jurisdiction. They ought to be estopped from pursuing such point further in the instant appeal. However, even if <i>res judicata</i> and issue estoppel did not apply and the appellants ought not be estopped from raising the issue of jurisdiction, the High Court would have still possessed the jurisdiction to adjudicate the judicial review application for the following reasons: (i) the 1st appellant by its actions was enforcing Syariah Law against the respondents; (ii) the appellants were public authorities performing a public duty and the respondents were aggrieved parties; (iii) the application by the respondents related to purported breaches of fundamental and constitutional rights of the respondents; (iv) the personal law of the 2nd respondent was not Syariah Law as he was a non-Muslim. There was also no "personal" law of the 1st respondent as it was a creature of statute and did not profess any religion; (v) there could be two jurisdictions on the same subject matter existing side by side namely, the secular law of the Federation and Syariah Law; (vi) although the SCO Act was a law for Muslims, the law did not take away the jurisdiction of the civil court to interpret it; (vii) it was a fallacy to think that generally a High Court exercising civil jurisdiction could not review the prosecution of cases under criminal law; (viii) in matters relating to fundamental and constitutional rights, the High Court exercised a supervisory role and it was the duty of the court to interpret the civil law and Syariah Law harmoniously; and (ix) the respondents' cause of action should not be confined to a claim of damages by way of writ action because the 1st appellant had gone beyond mere tortious liability and had instead breached the fundamental and constitutional rights of the respondents. (paras 41-46(l))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The proper approach to be taken in adjudicating the matter would be the pith and substance approach. The pith and substance approach was the correct approach as it was wide enough to include the consideration of both the subject matter of the case and the reliefs sought. (para 46(m))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The High Court judge was correct in her finding that the appellants had acted in excess of their powers and that their conduct was unreasonable and unlawful in the circumstances within what is commonly understood as the limits of the Wednesbury principle. <i>Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation (folld)</i>. (para 50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The circumstances in the present case in which the court was entitled to investigate the actions of the appellants, with a view to seeing if they had taken into account any matters that ought not to be taken into account or disregarded matters that ought to be taken into account were as follows: (i) as at the date of the search and seizure, <i>viz </i>23 May 2012, there was no fatwa, declaration, announcement or circular issued by the 1st appellant or by any other religious authority banning the publication and sale of the books by the respondents or by anyone else, for being in breach of Hukum Syarak; (ii) as at the date of the search and seizure,<i>viz</i> 23 May 2012, there was no Prohibition Order issued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7 of the PPP Act</LINK> by the 2nd respondent against the publication and sale of the books; (iii) it offended the sense of fair play and justice to accuse the 3rd respondent for being in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK>, when there was no fatwa, public notification or Prohibition in place on 23 May 2012 to alert the public on the "unlawful" status of the books; (iv) although an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK> was not contingent on a fatwa or even a Prohibitory Order, since the books had been in circulation internationally and locally, it would offend the sense of justice to charge a person for an offence for acts being contrary to Islamic Law when there was no reference point for members of the public to refer to in order to know the nature of the offence, such as if there had been a fatwa, Prohibition Order or any other form of notification;(v) since the offence was only an offence against the precepts of Islam and covered Muslims only, and there was no similar offence in the Federal Law - the "offence" could not be categorised as "criminal law" under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution ("the FC")</LINK>; (vi) the hearing in the High Court was not a judicial review of a criminal case but constituted the respondents challenging the action of the 1st appellant as being in breach of the provision on fundamental liberties under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;7.;;">art 7 of the FC</LINK>; (vii) the fact that the officers of the 1st appellant had gone to the bookstore with photographers and reporters showed conduct calculated to publicise the search and seizure, embarrass the respondents and was not a spontaneous raid conducted on receipt of a complaint; (viii) although the 1st appellant had sufficient time to apply for and obtain a search warrant, it did not do so; (ix) in the instant case, the officers of the 1st appellant had searched and seized the books when it was not illegal to publish and/or sell them in the first instance; and (x) the English edition of the books had been published internationally and were available in the international market for some time before the search and seizure at the 1st respondent's bookstore. The Bahasa Malaysia version of the books was published for the Malaysian market not too long before the search and seizure. (para 52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> This court, having evaluated the evidence and having considered the relevant law, reached the following conclusions: (i) the High Court exercising its supervisory civil jurisdiction was at liberty to interpret laws on fundamental liberties and to adjudicate on unconstitutional conduct by public authorities; (ii) the civil court had the jurisdiction and power to judicially review the improper institution of criminal proceedings when the impugned conduct was in fact not criminal in nature; (iii) the respondents were entitled to their legitimate expectation that the actions of the 1st appellant be carried out properly and lawfully; (iv) the civil court had the jurisdiction to adjudicate on the legal status of the 3rd respondent as it was a matter within the province of administrative law and the case did not cease to be within the jurisdiction of the civil court just because it had an Islamic Law element in it; (v) the 2nd respondent who was a non-Muslim could not be the subject of enforcement actions by the 1st appellant under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_560;;">Syariah Criminal Procedure (Federal Territories) Act 1997 as the SCO Act</LINK> applied to Muslims only. Non-Muslims could not be compelled to appear before the Syariah Court. Even if they consented, the Syariah Court had no jurisdiction over them. Jurisdiction was a matter of law, not of consent, acquiescence or convenience; (vi) no action could be taken against the 1st respondent as it was a corporate entity and incapable of professing a religion; (vii) the court was duty-bound to "uphold, protect and to ensure that justice is administered in a regular and effective manner according to law"; (viii) the appellants' actions against the 3rd respondent were unreasonable, irrational and tainted with <i>mala fides.</i> Since the 1st respondent and the 2nd respondent could not be subjected to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK> to take action against the 3rd respondent for an infringement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13</LINK> in the same transaction just because she was a Muslim would run counter to the principle of fairness and justice; and (ix) the 2nd respondent had successfully shown that the actions of the 1st appellant were illegal and irrational. The actions were an abuse and an unreasonable exercise of discretionary power, unconstitutional and procedurally improper. (para 53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> In the instant case, the High Court was constitutionally duty bound and seized with jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues and to grant the reliefs prayed for. (para 55)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Mah Weng Kwai JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The 1st appellant, Jabatan Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan (JAWI), is the department in charge of Islamic Affairs in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. The 2nd appellant is the Minister of Home Affairs while the 3rd appellant is the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Islamic Affairs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 1st respondent, a duly incorporated company under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">Companies Act 1965</LINK>, is the owner of Borders Bookstore (the Bookstore). Borders is an internationally renowned chain of bookshops. The 2nd respondent, Stephen Fung Wye Keong, a non-Muslim, was the General Manager of Operations and Merchandising of the 1st respondent and was fully responsible for the selection of titles and stock of books and publications displayed and sold at the Bookstore. The 3rd respondent, Nik Raina binti Nik Abdul Aziz was an employee of the 1st respondent. She was employed as the Store Manager of the Bookstore. The 3rd respondent was junior to and answerable to the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 23 May 2012, the 1st appellant conducted a search at the Bookstore at the Gardens, Mid Valley Mall, Jalan Syed Putra, Kuala Lumpur. Officers of the 1st appellant were accompanied by a group of reporters and photographers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The 1st appellant seized several books under two titles by an internationally known author, Irsyad Manji, entitled "Allah, Kebebasan dan Cinta" and "Allah, Liberty and Love" (the Books) after checking them at the Bookstore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The 1st appellant then examined the 2nd and the 3rd respondents at the premises and issued orders compelling them to be present at the 1st appellant's office for further examination and investigation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 29 May 2012, a Prohibition Order against the publication and sale of the Books was issued by the 2nd appellant. The Prohibition Order was published vide Gazette Notification PU(A) 162 on 14 June 2012, known as the Printing Presses and Publications (Control of Undesirable Publications) (No 3) Order 2012 under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 (the PPP Act)</LINK>, banning the publication and sale of the Books.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 2nd and 3rd respondents and another employee, Farihna binti Mohamed Fadhlullah attended the office of the 1st appellant on 30 May 2012 for the purpose of being examined and investigated further by the 1st appellant under the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_560;58.;;">s 58 of the Syariah Criminal Procedure (Federal Territories) Act 1997</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The 3rd respondent was arrested by the 1st appellant on 30 May 2012 and was charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the Syariah Criminal Offences (Federal Territories) Act 1997 (the SCO Act)</LINK> for the offence of "disseminating and distributing by way of selling the Books deemed contrary to Hukum Syarak (Islamic Law)".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> At the time of the search and seizure the Books were not subject to any Prohibition Order issued by the 2nd appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The 3rd respondent was not in any way responsible for the selection of titles of books to be sold at the Bookstore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> As at 23 May 2012, there was no fatwa, declaration, announcement or circular issued by the 1st appellant or by any other religious authority banning the publication and sale of the Books on the ground that it is in breach of Hukum Syarak. No prior notice of any objections was given by the 1st appellant and no search warrant was issued to the 1st appellant to conduct the search and seizure of the Books.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Proceedings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 18 June 2012, the respondents filed an application for leave for judicial review. Notice of the leave application and cause papers were served on the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Notwithstanding the pending hearing of the leave application, the 1st appellant charged the 3rd respondent under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK> at the Syariah Court, Kuala Lumpur on 19 June 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On 25 June 2012, the application was heard <i>inter partes</i> and leave was granted by the learned judge to the respondents. At the hearing, the Senior Federal Counsel for the appellants had argued that the High Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the judicial review application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> However, the appellants did not file a Notice of Appeal against the order of the learned judge granting leave for the judicial review application to be heard.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned judge heard the respondents' judicial review application on 11 March 2013 and on 22 March 2013, allowed the respondents' application for <i>inter alia</i>, <i>certiorari</i> orders to quash the decision and actions of the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Order Of The High Court Of 22 March 2013</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> After hearing the parties, the learned judge allowed the respondents' application in encl 15. It will be useful to set out here in full the terms of the order against which the appellants are appealing:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Being dissatisfied with the decision of the learned judge, the appellants' filed their Notice of Appeal on 2 April 2013 to the Court of Appeal on the main grounds <i>inter alia</i>, that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Decision Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Upon reading the written submissions of the Senior Federal Counsel for the appellants and counsel for the respondents and upon hearing oral submissions of the parties aforesaid on 21 August 2014 and 22 August 2014, this court reserved its decision to a date to be fixed by the Registrar.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We now deliver our decision and the grounds of our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> After a careful consideration of the written and oral submissions of the parties to this appeal and upon a careful analysis of the law and evaluation of the facts herein, we are of the unanimous view that there are no merits in the appeal and accordingly the appeal is hereby dismissed subject to the consequential orders as set out later in this judgment with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Judgment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellants' Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Central to the appellants' argument was that the High Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the judicial review application as the impugned actions of the 1st appellant dealt with Syariah Law and therefore came within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The Senior Federal Counsel submitted that the learned judge should have adopted the "subject based approach" and not the "remedy based approach" when considering and determining the issue of jurisdiction, with the subject matter here being the alleged commission of an offence by the 3rd respondent under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK>. It was contended that as the enforcement of the Syariah Law was by the 1st appellant, thus the subject matter "belonged" to the Syariah Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In support of his argument, the Senior Federal Counsel cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_173;"><i>Haji Raimi Abdullah v. Siti Hasnah Vangarama Abdullah &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 173</LINK>; [2014] 4 CLJ 253 which had recently reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_6_687;"><i>Siti Hasnah Vangarama Abdullah v. Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad &amp; Ors</i> [2012] 6 MLRA 687</LINK>; [2012] 7 CLJ 845; [2012] 6 AMR 485. The Federal Court in its decision, made after the decision of the learned judge in this case, held that the court in <i>Siti Hasnah</i> had to consider the subject matter of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The Senior Federal Counsel further submitted that the learned Judge had ignored the subject matter approach when she did not fully consider the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_257;"><i>Sulaiman Takrib v. Kerajaan Negeri Terengganu; Kerajaan Malaysia (Intervener) &amp; Other Cases</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 257</LINK>; [2009] 6 MLJ 354; [2009] 2 CLJ 54, which had decided to adopt the subject matter approach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The Senior Federal Counsel also cited the cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_570;"><i>Azizah Shaik Ismail &amp; Anor v. Fatimah Shaik Ismail &amp; Anor</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 570</LINK>; [2004] 2 MLJ 529; [2003] 4 CLJ 281; [2002] 4 AMR 4437 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_847;"><i>Latifah Mat Zin v. Rosmawati Sharibun &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 847</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 101; [2007] 5 CLJ 253; [2006] 4 AMR 591 both of which seemed to decide that the correct approach to be followed is the "subject based" approach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The appellants' case was that if there was any complaint by the respondents on the ground that the search and seizure of the Books were wrongful then the respondents' cause of action would be in tort and by way of a writ action and not by way of a judicial review. And although the 1st and 2nd respondents being non-Muslims were not charged in the Syariah Court, they could be called as witnesses in the case against the 3rd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The second ground relied on by the Senior Federal Counsel was that the learned judge had erred in holding that the actions of the 1st appellant were unlawful and in excess of their powers. The Senior Federal Counsel submitted that the issue of "irrationality" should be dealt with by a Syariah Court as it encroached onto issues of fact and in any event the judicial review jurisprudence is not suitable for criminal cases. The Senior Federal Counsel contended that the offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK> is very distinct from offences under the PPP Act and that significantly, there is no requirement for a Prohibition Order before a person can be charged for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The Senior Federal Counsel submitted that there was no <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the 1st appellant when it conducted the search and seizure of the Books at the Bookstore and that there was neither malicious intent nor collateral purpose envisaged on the part of the officers of the 1st appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondents' Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The response of the respondents' counsel to the submission by the Senior Federal Counsel that the subject based approach ought to have been followed by the learned judge was that the Senior Federal Counsel had failed to consider instead the "pith and substance approach" which was the correct and proper approach to be adopted when dealing with this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The "pith and substance approach" to the case according to counsel was that any alleged offence against the precepts of Islamic law is not a criminal offence as was upheld in the case of <i>Sulaiman Takrib (supra)</i>. It was argued by counsel that as Syariah Law is a personal law it should apply to Muslims only and not to non-Muslims such as the 2nd respondent in this instance when he was examined by officers of the 1st appellant under the provisions of the SCO Act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The pith and substance approach would not be confined to Syariah issues and to the sections of the law but importantly to consider the breach of the constitutional rights of the respondents occasioned by the search and seizure of the Books and the examination of the 2nd respondent in particular, at the office of the 1st appellant. It is not just about the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK><i>per se</i> but rather it was about the powers of the 1st appellant and the conduct of its officers at the search and seizure at the Bookstore and the subsequent examination of witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Counsel relied on the Federal Court case of <i>Latifah (supra)</i> and submitted that the Federal Court did not follow the subject based approach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> On the issue of jurisdiction, counsel for the respondents invoked the principle of <i>res judicata</i> and submitted that the appellants should be estopped from revisiting the issue as the learned judge had already determined that the High Court had the jurisdiction to hear the case when leave to file the judicial review application was allowed and that the appellants did not file a Notice of Appeal against the said order. The <i>ex parte</i> application was in fact heard<i> inter partes</i> and the issue of jurisdiction had been fully ventilated before the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The respondents in their <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53.;;">O 53 Rules of Court 2012</LINK> application was not challenging the validity of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK> or that the State has no power to enact laws on Islamic matters but were maintaining that the State cannot enact laws on matters which come within the purview of the Federal Government and that the application for declaratory reliefs was not in violation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4(4) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. The respondents merely sought the reliefs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;53.;;">O 53</LINK> to bind the parties only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> At the commencement of this appeal we saw it proper to remind ourselves that the case before the learned judge was a judicial review application and not an appeal against the actions and decisions of the respondents. In doing so we had in mind what Lord Roskill said in the case of <i>Council of Civil Service Unions &amp; Ors v. Minister for the Civil Service</i> [1985] 1 AC 374 to wit:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We were further mindful of what was said by the Federal Court of Ireland in <i>Caslow Kilkenny Radio Ltd v. Broadcasting Commisioner</i> [2003] 3 IR 528 that a judicial review was not concerned about the correctness of a decision but rather with the way that decision was arrived at (see also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1990_1_34;"><i>Harpers Trading (M) Sdn Bhd v. National Union Of Commercial Workers</i> [1990] 1 MELR 34</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 417; [1991] 1 CLJ 159).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Thus, the focus of these grounds of judgment, in the later part of the judgment will be on the manner in which the decision was made by the appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The <i>Res Judicata</i> And Issue Estoppel Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The issue of jurisdiction was seriously challenged by the appellants in the High Court at the stage of hearing of the leave application. Notwithstanding the strong objections of the appellants, the learned judge ruled that the High Court had the jurisdiction to hear and grant the leave application. It is significant to note that the appellants did not appeal against the decision of the learned judge on the grant of leave thereby impliedly and/or expressly conceding that the High Court did have jurisdiction in the matter and that the decision of the learned judge was a final order in the circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> It was argued by the Senior Federal Counsel that in an application for leave, the threshold applicable is a low threshold (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_2_390;"><i>Abdul Rahman Abdullah Munir &amp; Ors v. Datuk Bandar Kuala Lumpur &amp; Anor</i> [2008] 2 MLRA 390</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 704; [2008] 6 CLJ 805). We agree generally with this proposition of law but we wish to add that we take the view that while the threshold in an application for leave may be lower in terms of facts, the threshold on matters of law would be the same as in the hearing of the judicial review itself. This is because the issue of jurisdiction of the court goes to the root of the matter before the court. It is a fundamental issue and it cannot be that a question of law will be decided on a lower standard in a leave application and the same question of law will be decided on a higher standard in the full hearing of the judicial review application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Examining the same objection by the Senior Federal Counsel from a different perspective, the following question may be asked and that is, can the learned judge change her mind and overrule her own decision and hold that the High Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the judicial review application after having in the first instance granted leave on the basis that the High Court was seized with jurisdiction? The answer to the question in our view must surely be a resounding no.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> During the hearing of the appeal, it was submitted by the Senior Federal Counsel that the doctrine of issue estoppel cannot be relied on in an application for judicial review. The Senior Federal Counsel referred to the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Abdul Rahman Abdullah Munir (supra)</i> in support of his proposition where Abdull Hamid Embong JCA (as he then was) speaking for the court held that the doctrine of issue estoppel had no application in the appeal. The court had agreed with the submission of counsel for the appellants in <i>Abdul Rahman</i>. There, counsel had merely referred to a line in the judgment of Sir John Donaldson MR who stated that the doctrine of issue estoppel "has no place in public law and judicial review in the case of <i>R v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Ex parte Hackney London Borough Council and Anor</i> [1983] 3 AER 358 (see also <i>Ali v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [1984] 1 AER 1009)".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> While we agree issue estoppel is not absolute and there may be special circumstances, (eg change in material facts or law) which may allow a court to reopen the issue in a subsequent proceeding, (see <i>Arnold v. National Westminster Bank Plc</i> [1991] 1 AC 93), we are clearly of the view that there are no prevailing circumstances in this case to justify the reopening of the issue of jurisdiction in this appeal given that the issue had been fully canvassed before the learned Judge and that the appellants had chosen not to appeal against the said decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> We are thus of the view that the appellants cannot now raise the issue of lack of jurisdiction. They are estopped from pursuing this point further in the hearing of this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> However, in the event we are wrong to hold that <i>res judicata</i> and issue estoppel do apply in the circumstances of this case and that the appellants should not be estopped from further raising the issue of jurisdiction of the High Court in this appeal, we are nonetheless, of the view that the High Court did possess the jurisdiction to adjudicate in the judicial review application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We say the High Court has the jurisdiction to hear the judicial review application for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;128.;;">Article 128 Of The Federal Constitution</LINK> Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> At the outset of his submission, the Senior Federal Counsel informed the court that he would not be taking the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;128.;;">art 128</LINK> argument on the jurisdiction of the Federal Court although he had submitted on it in his written submissions. Thus this issue will not be dealt with in these grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Paragraphs (f) And (g) Of The Order Of The High Court Of 22 March 2013 Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The Senior Federal Counsel informed the court that if the court was not with him in the appeal, counsel for the respondents had agreed to strike out paras (f) and (g) from the Order of the High Court of 22 March 2013, by consent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Hence, in view of our decision in this appeal we will not be discussing on whether the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK> are in excess of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">art 74</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;;">Ninth Schedule, List II of the Federal List</LINK> to the extent 'that it purports to prescribe offences relating to "printing, publishing, producing, recording, distributing or in any other manner disseminating any book, pamphlet, documents or any form of recordings", which are not matters capable of being legislated thereunder' and whether the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_559;13.;;">s 13 of the SCO Act</LINK> are <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">art 74</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Ninth Schedule List I of the Federal List</LINK> to the extent 'that it purports to prescribe matters relating to "newspaper, publishing, publisher, printing and printing press" which are expressly reserved to be legislated by the federal law to be within the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts and not the Syariah Courts'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The <i>Wednesbury</i> Principle</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In so far as the second main ground of appeal by the appellants is concerned, we are of the view that the learned judge was correct in her finding that the appellants had acted in excess of their powers and that their conduct was unreasonable and unlawful in the circumstances within what is commonly understood as the limits of the <i>Wednesbury</i> principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In <i>Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation</i> [1948] 1 KB 223, the English Court of Appeal held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The circumstances in the present case in which the court was entitled to investigate the actions of the appellants with a view to seeing if they had taken into account any matters that ought not to be taken into account or disregarded matters that ought to be taken into account were <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Having evaluated the evidence and considered the law pertaining to this case, we are of the view that the following conclusions may be stated or restated, as the case may be, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> On a final note we would like to emphasise that Malaysia has subscribed to the doctrine of constitutional supremacy and all judges have taken the oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Any law whether it is Federal or State Law which is in breach of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> must be struck down when challenged and the Federal or any State Government and/or its agencies which apply the law wrongfully must be corrected through the judicial review process. In consequence and in addition to the <i>Wednesbury</i> principle which relates to administrative action, the court is obliged to provide relief when the fundamental guarantee provisions are breached.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> For reasons stated above we maintain that the High Court is constitutionally duty bound and seized with jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues and to grant the reliefs prayed for. (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_362;"><i>Nik Noorhafizi Nik Ibrahim &amp; Ors v.
