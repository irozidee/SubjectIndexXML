    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant commenced arbitration when the 2nd respondent terminated its contract with the appellant for the upgrading of schools in Sarawak. The appellant's proposed arbitrator, Tan Sri Datuk Amar Steve Shim Lip Kiong ('TSDASS'), was disputed by the 2nd respondent. As a result of that, the appellant had written to the Director of the Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration ('KLRCA') to appoint an arbitrator, which led to the appointment of the 1st respondent. The appellant however disputed the 1st respondent's appointment on the ground that the 1st respondent was not qualified as he was not from Sarawak and therefore lacked geographical knowledge of Sarawak to hear the dispute. The appellant then applied to the High Court, <i>inter alia</i>, for a declaration that the 1st respondent's appointment as an arbitrator be terminated with immediate effect and that the arbitration be held in Sarawak. The High Court dismissed the application and the appellant now appealed. There were two main grounds in this appeal: (i) that KLRCA breached its duties to act fairly and to consult the appellant before appointing the 1st respondent; and (ii) that the learned judge erred in fact and in law in failing to appreciate that the seat of arbitration should be in Sarawak where the dispute had the closest and real connection and where the contract was executed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Though arbitration was intended for a voluntary process, once a dispute had arisen, even parties acting <i>bona fide</i> find it difficult to agree, <i>ex post facto</i>. Parties might attempt to obstruct the appointment to delay the arbitration. That could frustrate the agreement. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">Subsections 13(3) and (5) of the Arbitration Act 2005 ('the Act')</LINK> were a means of breaking deadlocks that render the agreement inoperable. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> By virtue of cl 59(h) of the contract, the parties had agreed that in the event the 2nd respondent and the appellant failed to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, the Director of the KLRCA should appoint an arbitrator. As regards the qualification of an arbitrator to be appointed, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsection 13(8) of the Act</LINK> provided that the Director of the KLRCA should have regard to any qualification required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and other considerations that were likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator, amongst others. It was clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsection 13(8)</LINK>, that the Director of the KLRCA was empowered to appoint a sole arbitrator. The section did not stipulate that before the appointment of a sole arbitrator, the consent of the parties was required nor did it stipulate that before the arbitrator was appointed, the Director of the KLRCA was required to seek the consent of the parties. (paras 14-16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The power exercised by the Director of the KLRCA under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsections 13(4) and (5) of the Act</LINK> was an administrative power. The Director of the KLRCA was not required to determine the question of the validity of the arbitration agreement, the maintainability and arbitrability of the claim and other jurisdictional matters. The subsections merely provided for the Director of the KLRCA to appoint arbitrator(s) in the event the parties failed to agree on the arbitration. The Director's function was not a judicial function where he had to afford the right to be heard to the parties before an arbitrator(s) was appointed. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was no pre-agreement between the parties on the qualification of an arbitrator in the present appeal. It could not be denied that TSDASS, being a Sarawakian, was in a better position to appreciate the geography of the project site, particularly its remoteness and accessibility but that was not to say that the 1st respondent could not acquire the same knowledge. If the need arose, evidence could be led to show the geographical impediments that were of concern to the appellant and the parties could always suggest to the arbitrator to visit the project site. The knowledge was not impossible to acquire and was not such that it was dependent on the inherent capability of the appellant's arbitrator of choice. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> If a party had agreed with open eyes and full knowledge and comprehension of a clause in the contract that in the event they failed to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, an arbitrator should be appointed by the Director of the KLRCA, such a party could not subsequently turn around and contend that it agreed to the settlement of disputes by arbitration but only by the arbitrator of his/her own choice. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The court could not interpose and interdict the appointment of an arbitrator whom the parties had agreed to be appointed by the named appointing authority under the terms of the contract, except in cases where it was proved that there were circumstances which gave rise to justifiable doubt as to the 1st respondent's impartiality, independence or that the 1st respondent did not possess the qualification agreed to by the parties. The appellant failed to persuade the court that the 1st respondent should be disqualified on those grounds. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The parties had agreed in the contract that the arbitration be conducted at the KLRCA in Kuala Lumpur. The learned judge was correct in holding that the court had to respect what the parties themselves had intended and agreed in writing. Arbitration was a matter of contract and the court must rigorously enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms, including terms that specified the appointment of an arbitrator that would arbitrate their disputes.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court at Kuching in which the appellant's originating summons seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, for a declaration that the 1st respondent's appointment as an arbitrator in the dispute between the appellant and the respondent be terminated with immediate effect and for an order that the seat of arbitration to be in Sarawak was dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant and the 2nd respondent are entangled in a disagreement over the appointment of an arbitrator by the Director of the Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration ("KLRCA") to hear and decide their dispute related to the alleged unlawful termination of the contract by the 2nd respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> For the purpose of appreciating the competing contentions urged on behalf of the parties, the brief facts may be stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned High Court Judge found the originating summons bereft of merit and dismissed the same with costs. The learned judge in a very detailed and well-reasoned judgment set out carefully the arguments of the parties and explained her reasons for rejecting the appellant's case and accepting the respondent's submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We do not propose to rehearse the grounds of judgment except to highlight the learned judge's key findings as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We find no cogent reasons to disturb the learned judge's findings and determination. The learned judge interpreted and applied the law correctly, and therefore, we affirm the decision of the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Nonetheless, for the sake of completeness, we will address the grounds raised by the appellant in this instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Before us, counsel for the appellant confined his submissions to two main grounds as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Ground (i)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As regards the first ground, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the KLRCA had appointed the 1st respondent unilaterally without considering the appellant's request by way of letters dated 15 May 2013 and 11 June 2013 respectively to appoint TSDASS as a sole arbitrator. It was the contention of learned counsel that the choice of arbitrator should or ought to be that of the parties in dispute. Both parties must have equal rights in selecting their arbitrator(s). It is important that parties have confidence in the arbitrator(s) and the proceedings, which means they must have the right to challenge an arbitrator who does not inspire confidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In support of his submissions, reliance was placed on the case of <i>Hindustan Steel Works Construction Ltd v. Chotanagpur Mining Corporation</i> [1973] AIR Pat 416, <i>State v. DC Degara</i> [1984] 58 Cut LT 643, <i>State of Orissa v. Gangaram Chhapolia</i> [1982] 54 Cut LT 214. According to learned counsel, the principle of all these cases is that parties have to be heard not only regarding the appointment but also the person to be appointed as arbitrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> As regards the second ground, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the seat of arbitration should be in Sarawak as the material witnesses are from Kuching, Kapit and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Analysis And Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> As we have alluded to earlier, the parties could not agree on any person to be appointed as an arbitrator to arbitrate the dispute between them. As suggested by the 2nd respondent, on 3 June 2013, the appellant's advocate sent a letter to the Director of the KLRCA requesting him to appoint a person to be the arbitrator of the dispute pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsection 13(5)(a) and (b) of the Act 646</LINK>. The Director of the KLRCA had appointed the 1st respondent as sole arbitrator in the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It bears reiterating that though arbitration is intended for a voluntary process, once a dispute has arisen, even parties acting <i>bona fide</i> find it difficult to agree, <i>ex post facto</i>. Parties may attempt to obstruct the appointment to delay the arbitration. This can frustrate the agreement. In our view, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsections 13(3) and (5) of Act 646</LINK> are a means of breaking deadlock that render the agreement inoperable. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">Subsections 13(4) and (5)</LINK> are in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In this instant appeal, by virtue of cl 59(h) of the contract, the parties had agreed that in the event the 2nd respondent and the appellant failing to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, an arbitrator shall be appointed by the person named in the Appendix to the conditions of the contract, ie the Director of the KLRCA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> As regards qualification of an arbitrator to be appointed, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsection 13(8) of Act 646</LINK> provides that the Director of the KLRCA shall have regard to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It is clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsection 13(8)</LINK>, that the Director of the KLRCA is empowered to appoint a sole arbitrator. The section does not stipulate that before the appointment of a sole arbitrator, the consent of the parties is required nor does it stipulate that before the arbitrator is appointed, the Director of the KLRCA is required to seek consent of the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It should be noted that the power exercised by the Director of the KLRCA under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;13.;;">subsections 13(4) and (5) of Act 646</LINK> is an administrative power. The Director of the KLRCA is not required to determine the question of the validity of the arbitration agreement, the maintainability and arbitrability of the claim and other jurisdictional matters. The subsections merely provide for the Director of the KLRCA to appoint arbitrator(s) in the event the parties fail to agree on the arbitration. The director's function is not a judicial function where he has to afford the right to be heard to the parties before an arbitrator(s) is appointed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We are in full agreement with the findings of the learned judge that there was no pre-agreement between the parties on the qualification of an arbitrator in this instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant forcefully argued that TSDASS is a fit and proper person to hear the matter because, <i>inter alia</i>, he is the former Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak and has held high judicial office before he retired and he has acquired local knowledge that are relevant in understanding the appellant's claim to resolve the differences in a just and impartial manner. With respect, we agree with the learned judge when she observed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Before we conclude the discussion on the first ground, we must say that if a party had agreed with an open eyes and full knowledge and comprehension of a clause in the contract that in the event they fail to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, an arbitrator shall be appointed by the Director of the KLRCA, such a party cannot subsequently turn around and contend that it agrees to the settlement of disputes by arbitration but only by the arbitrator of his/her own choice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In our view, the court cannot interpose and interdict the appointment of an arbitrator whom the parties have agreed to be appointed by the named appointing authority under the terms of the contract, except in cases where it is proved that there are circumstances which give rise to justifiable doubt as the 1st respondent's impartiality or independence or that the 1st respondent did not possess the qualification agreed to by the parties. The appellant fails to persuade us that the 1st respondent should be disqualified on those grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground (ii)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As regards the second ground, it is not in dispute that the parties had agreed in the contract dated 27 February 2009 in cl 54(c) that the arbitration to be conducted at the KLRCA in Kuala Lumpur. The learned judge was correct in holding that the court had to respect what the parties themselves had intended and agreed in writing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Arbitration is a matter of contract and the court must rigorously enforce arbitration agreement according to their terms, including terms that specify the appointment of an arbitrator that will arbitrate their disputes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> For the reason set forth above, we find that the appeal is sans merit and therefore should be dismissed with costs of RM10,000.00. Deposit to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The arbitrator has already been appointed. He should proceed in the matter and decide the dispute expeditiously.</p>
