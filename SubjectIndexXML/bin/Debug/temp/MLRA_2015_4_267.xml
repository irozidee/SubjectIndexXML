    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant sued the respondent in the High Court, <i>inter alia</i>, to annul the transfer of his property ("the property") to the respondent. The appellant's case was that he had deposited the title deed to his property with the respondent for a RM25,000 loan, repayable at installments of RM1,250 over a period of 36 months. He had signed several blank forms at the material time, thinking that those forms were part of the loan agreement. However, the appellant later discovered that he had in fact signed forms to transfer the property over to the respondent. The respondent maintained that he had purchased the property and had paid the full purchase price. The respondent further alleged that the appellant had in fact been paying a monthly rental for the property until March 2010 when he defaulted. The High Court dismissed the claim and the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. At the hearing of the appeal, the respondent raised a preliminary objection, contending that the appeal was incompetent and ought to be struck out since no leave had been obtained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the preliminary objection and allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The preliminary objection was based upon a technical non-compliance, a term meaning a non-compliance that did not affect the justice of the case. It was a technical non-compliance in this case because the Record of Appeal was complete. The court and parties, but for the preliminary objection, were ready to proceed with the appeal. It was not shown how the non-compliance adversely affected the fair and just disposal of the appeal. (para 3)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The High Court's view concerning the application for a caveat had no place in the judgment dismissing the appellant's claim and where the respondent had already entered upon the register of titles as the registered proprietor of the property. The High Court's views concerning the non-production of the loan agreement or documentation overlooked the appellant's case that he had deposited his title deed to the property and signed blank documents for the loan, and not the sale and purchase agreement or documents associated with a sale and purchase. The appellant thus could not be expected to produce any loan agreement. Further, the High Court's reasoning as to the appellant being bound by the blank forms signed, failed to consider that the appellant signed the blank forms thinking they were to be used for a loan agreement. (para 10)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The reasoning of the High Court missed the forest for the trees. The transaction was by no means a sale and purchase and a rental back. The terms were consistent with a loan for a specific term, supporting the appellant's version that the transaction was a loan agreement for 36 months. The registration of a transfer through forms signed in blank, whilst the appellant was led to believe that the documents were for a loan, was clearly a fraud. (paras 11 &amp; 15)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The plaintiff Udiya Chandran Subramaniam ("the appellant") appealed against the dismissal with costs of his claim against the defendant Loo Tak Lam ("the respondent").</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminary Objection</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It was submitted for the respondent that since: (a) there was no appeal against the dismissal of the prayer for damages for loss of the said land and special damages of RM202,000.00 for loss of income and loss of rental; and (b) the market value of the land is RM37,000.00, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;18.;;">r 18(1) of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994</LINK> requires that the appellant must obtain leave to appeal. Thus, because no leave had been obtained, this appeal is incompetent and ought to be struck out with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We dismissed the preliminary objection with agreed costs fixed at RM2,500.00 on the grounds that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant commenced the civil suit for, <i>inter alia</i>, the annulment of the transfer of the property known as PM 7, Lot 3225, Mukim Jimah, Daerah Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan ("the property") to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The case for the appellant was that he deposited the title deed with the respondent for a loan of RM25,000.00 and that the repayment of the said loan was for a period of 36 months, but discovered that the document he signed was to transfer the said property to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In resisting the civil suit, the respondent maintained that he had purchased the said property and that he had already paid the full purchase price. In resisting the appellant's averment that the appellant had been paying RM1,250.00 until March 2012 when he defaulted, the respondent maintained that the payments were a monthly rental for the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The High Court summed up the appellant's claim as, <i>inter alia</i>, for the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The High Court arrived at its decision to dismiss the claim as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Reasoning</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We allowed the appeal with costs, set aside the order of the High Court, entered judgment in terms of prayers A, B, C and D, and fixed costs in the sum of RM30,000.00 here and below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Our reasons are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> With respect, the reasoning in the grounds of judgment of the High Court missed the forest for the trees. The appellant's claim was based on the assertion of facts that he had sought a loan of RM25,000.00, had obtained it from the respondent and to whom he was making repayments of RM1,250.00 per month until March 2012 when he faced difficulties to make payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant had asserted that he:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The defence by the respondent was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> At first sight we were inclined to agree with the High Court. On closer examination, we realised that the defence assertion of having no knowledge that the appellant went to work in New Zealand is no answer to the appellant's assertion that he went to work in New Zealand. The evidence produced before the High Court supported the appellant's assertion he went to work in New Zealand. This, the High Court failed to take into consideration. Had the High Court taken this into consideration, it would be led to question the respondent's version that there was a sale and purchase and the appellant rented back the property from the respondent. If one were to believe it, the respondent's version is that it was unimportant if the appellant was on the property. If the appellant had to sell the property and went to New Zealand, there was no reason to rent it back at a substantial rent of RM1,250.00 considering the sale and purchase at RM25,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Furthermore, accepting that monthly payments were RM1,250.00, then over 36 months it would amount to RM45,000.00. If RM1,250.00 is taken for rental of the RM25,000.00 property, it amounts to 5% of the property value per month or 60% per year. Another way of looking at it is that payment at RM1,250.00 per month means the RM25,000.00 purchase price is recovered in 20 months of such rental. On such lucrative terms, it defeats reason why no rental agreement was signed. In our view, the transaction was by no means a sale and purchase and a rental back. The terms were consistent with a loan for a specific term. This supports the appellant's version that it was a loan agreement for 36 months. That being so, the registration of a transfer through forms signed in blank, while the appellant was led to believe the documents were for a loan, was clearly a fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Accordingly, we allowed the appeal, and made the orders set out at para 9 above.</p>
