    <p>The respondents were directors of Ganad Media Sdn Bhd ("GM") and signatories to its bank accounts. Both respondents were responsible for and managed GM's finances. The respondents were charged with 14 offences relating to their breach of trust or misappropriation of two sums of money - RM6,500 and RM85,000. The money represented payments to landowners for rentals of sites for the placement and erection of outdoor advertising billboards. The moneys were paid out to fictitious landowners who were not parties to the contracts GM had with the actual landowners upon whose lands the billboards were erected. The respondents were acquitted and discharged at the end of the prosecution's case in the Sessions Court. The Public Prosecutor appealed against the acquittal but the appeal was dismissed. The Public Prosecutor appealed to the Court of Appeal against the acquittal on three charges under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409.;;">s 409 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the Public Prosecutor's appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondents were indeed agents of GM within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;402A.;;">s 402A of the Penal Code</LINK> and were entrusted with or had dominion over the funds of the company, specifically the RM85,000 and the RM6,500 which formed the subject matter of the charges against them. (para 5)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondents' actions in disposing of the company's funds in violation of the rental contracts GM had with the landowners in their capacity as agents of the company fell squarely within the ambit of the second limb of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409B.;;">s 409B of the Penal Code</LINK>. The RM85,000 and the RM6,500 were meant for the actual owners of the lands and not for strangers or non-parties to the contracts. By making the unauthorised payments, clearly the respondents were in violation of the legal contracts touching on the discharge of the company's funds. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> By operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409B.;;">s 409B(1)(b)(ii) of the Penal Code</LINK>, the respondents were presumed to have acted dishonestly when they caused payments to be made to the unauthorised individuals. The presumption could be rebutted by the respondents' own evidence but there was none in the instant case. The respondents therefore had to adduce evidence to rebut the presumption on a preponderance of probability. This could only be done if they were to enter their defence. (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In a prosecution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409.;;">s 409 of the Penal Code</LINK> it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove dominion by establishing control or power of disposal over the property. There is no requirement to prove dominion to the exclusion of all other persons. Being the directors of GM and having power to sign the company's cheques, the respondents clearly had control and power of disposal over the company's funds. The fact that there were others in the company who had power to sign the company's cheques did not dilute the respondents' control and power of disposal over the funds. The court was not concerned with the power of others over the funds but whether the respondents were actuated by dishonest intention when they disposed of the company's property. Under the law it is not even a defence to show that the property was openly appropriated or that the appropriation was duly recorded and entered in the books and accounts of the company. (paras 17-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> This court was unable to agree with the High Court's affirmation that the manner in which the activities of GM were carried out would preclude any other person from having control over the company's funds and affairs without the knowledge and approval of PW2 - GM's Chief Executive Officer. There was no evidence that PW2 knew about the unauthorised payments and secondly there was no evidence that the respondents had obtained PW2's approval prior to making the payments. Therefore, the question of PW2 having approved the payments did not arise. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> An appellate court will always be slow to interfere with findings of fact made by the trial court where such findings depend on the credibility of witnesses. However, an appellate court can and will interfere if the trial court's finding of fact is perverse and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or is against the probabilities of the case. In the instant case, the Sessions Court Judge's rejection of PW20's evidence on the premise that the respondents had no opportunity to give the oral instructions due to GM's stringent procedure in approving the payment vouchers was perverse and did not stand up to reason. (paras 22 &amp; 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, not beyond the shadow or flicker of a doubt. In the instant case, both the Sessions Court and the High Court were wrong in finding that no <i>prima facie</i> case had been established against the respondents in respect of the charges. Thus the order of acquittal ought to be set aside and substituted with an order that the defence be called. (paras 34 &amp; 36)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In the Sessions Court the respondents were charged with 14 offences but for purposes of this appeal only the following three charges under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409.;;">s 409 of the Penal Code</LINK> are relevant for consideration:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the close of the prosecution case, the respondents were acquitted and discharged without their defence being called. The learned Sessions Court Judge found that no <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out against either of them. The Public Prosecutor appealed to the High Court against the order of acquittal but their appeal was dismissed. Hence this appeal before us. Having heard arguments from both sides on 23 September 2014 we unanimously allowed the Public Prosecutor's appeal and ordered the case to be remitted back to the Sessions Court for the respondents to enter upon their defence before the same judge. These are our grounds for allowing the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Leaving out the minute details, the evidence led by the prosecution can be summarised as follows. Until their resignations on 20 June 2000 and 16 May 2000 respectively, the 1st and 2nd respondents were directors of Ganad Media Sdn Bhd (Ganad Media ) which is a subsidiary of Ganad Corporation Bhd of which Gan Kok Beng (PW2) is the Chief Executive Officer. As directors of the company the respondents were signatories to the bank accounts of Ganad Media.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It is the evidence of PW2 that he had entrusted the daily management of Ganad Media to the 1st respondent since 1994 and that after the 1st respondent's discharge as a bankrupt in 1997, he was made the Managing Director of the subsidiary company. The 2nd respondent was the 1st respondent s right hand person. Both she and 1st respondent were responsible for the company's finance and accounts. Prosecution witnesses PW7, PW15, PW16 and PW19 who were employees of Ganad Media confirmed that the company's finances were managed by the two respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On these facts there can be no doubt in our view that the respondents were agents of Ganad Media within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;402A.;;">s 402A of the Penal Code</LINK> and were entrusted with or had dominion over the funds of the company, specifically the RM85,000.00 and the RM6,500.00 which form the subject matter of the charges against them. The question left to be considered is whether the respondents had committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The lynchpin of the prosecution's case is the testimony of Yew Hui Mei (PW20). Her position in Ganad Media at the material time was as Acquisition Manager. Her immediate boss was the 1st respondent to whom she reported. The crucial part of PW20's evidence in relation to the first and third charges is that it was the two respondents who instructed her to prepare the five payment vouchers (P6, P7, P9, P10, P11) for payment of the RM85,000.00 to the following individuals:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> These payouts were purportedly as payments for the rentals of Site No MLK 0109, Site No JHR 0074, and Site No SEL 0676 which Ganad Media rented from the landowners in the course of carrying on their business of outdoor billboard advertising. These individuals were fictitious landowners as they were not parties to the contracts Ganad Media had with the actual landowners on whose lands the advertising billboards were erected. The real landowners (or children of the owners) were called to give evidence and they confirmed that they did not know the recipients of the payments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The evidence of PW3 and PW7 is that it was the two respondents who signed the approved columns of the payment vouchers at P7, P9 and P10 and it was also the two respondents who signed the cheques at P24, P25(a), P29, P32 and P33. All five cheques had been cashed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> With regard to the criminal breach of trust charge against the 2nd respondent, the <i>modus operandi</i> was identical. The evidence of PW20 is that she was instructed by the respondents to prepare the payment voucher at P8 for payment of the sum of RM6,500.00 to one Ibrahim bin Jonid who again was a stranger to the rental contract between Ganad Media and the landowner and was not supposed to receive the payment. The RM6,500.00 was meant for one Jasman bin Jonid, the land owner of the other advertising site. PW7 confirmed that the 2nd respondent was one of the signatories to the cheque that was paid out to Ibrahim bin Jonid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Criminal breach of trust is defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;405.;;">s 405 of the Penal Code</LINK> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> By the terms of the provision a person entrusted with property or with dominion over the property commits criminal breach of trust in respect of the property if he does any of the following acts, <i>viz</i>: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The offence does not count as one of its factors, the loss that is the consequence of the act; it is the act itself, which in law, amounts to an offence. The offence is complete when there is dishonest misappropriation or conversion to one's own use, or when there is dishonest user in violation of a direction, express or implied, relating to the mode in which the trust is to be discharged: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1970_1_166;"><i>Sathiadas v. PP</i> [1970] 1 MLRH 166</LINK>; [1970] 2 MLJ 241 per Raja Azlan Shah J (as his late Highness then was). In relation to paras (1), (3), (4) and (5) above, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409B.;;">s 409B(1)(b) of the Penal Code</LINK> is relevant and stipulates as follows: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The learned High Court Judge in affirming the order of acquittal held the view that the above statutory presumption has no application as there was no violation of law involved. With due respect to the learned judge it appears that she was only focusing her attention on the first limb of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) without addressing her mind to the second limb.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It is our considered view that the respondents act of disposing of the company's funds in violation of the rental contracts Ganad Media had with the landowners in their capacity as agents of the company falls squarely within the ambit of the second limb of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii). The RM85,000.00 and the RM6,500.00 were meant for the actual owners of the lands and not for strangers or non-parties to the contracts. By making the unauthorised payments, clearly the respondents were in violation of the legal contracts touching the discharge of the company's funds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Therefore by operation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409B.;;">s 409B(1)(b)(ii) of the Penal Code</LINK> the respondents were presumed to have acted dishonestly when they caused payments to be made to the unauthorised individuals. The presumption can of course be rebutted by the respondents' own evidence but there is none in this case. It behooves the respondents therefore to adduce evidence to rebut the presumption on a preponderance of probability and this can only be done if they were to enter their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In her judgment the learned Sessions Court Judge found that the respondents had no exclusive power or dominion over Ganad Media's funds as such power was in the hands of PW2, being the Chief Executive Officer and the brain and mind of the company. She described PW2 as the most powerful person in Ganad Media.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned Sessions Court Judge used such words as 'ekslusiviti dan/ atau dominasi', 'ekslusif kuasa', 'dominasi kuasa penuh', 'kuasa ekslusif ' in determining whether the respondents had dominion over Ganad Media's funds. We consider this to be a misdirection. In a prosecution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409.;;">s 409 of the Penal Code</LINK> it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove dominion by establishing control or power of disposal over the property. There is no requirement to prove dominion to the exclusion of all other persons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Being the directors of Ganad Media and having power to sign the company's cheques, clearly the respondents had control and power of disposal over the company's funds. The fact that there were others in the company who had power to sign the company's cheques does not dilute the respondents control and power of disposal over the funds. The court is not concerned with the power of others over the funds but whether the respondents were actuated by dishonest intention when they disposed of the company's property. Under the law it is not even a defence to show that the property was openly appropriated or that the appropriation was duly recorded and entered in the books and accounts of the company: see <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409A.;;">s 409A of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We are also unable to agree with the learned High Court Judge who affirmed the order of acquittal that the manner in which the activities of Ganad Media were carried out would preclude any other person from having control over the company's funds and affairs without the knowledge and approval of PW2. First of all, there is no evidence that PW2 knew about the unauthorised payments and secondly there is no evidence that the respondents had obtained PW2's approval prior to making the payments. Therefore with all due respect to the learned judge, the question of PW2 having approved the payments does not arise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We shall now deal with the way the learned Sessions Court Judge handled PW20 as a witness. She described PW20's testimony as 'penuh dengan kepurapuraan, penipuan dan rekaan' (full of pretence, deceit and inventions). She also found PW20 to be an interested and bias witness. By using such strong words against PW20 it is fair to assume that in the mind of the learned Sessions Court Judge, PW20 was incapable of telling the truth and would lie at the drop of a hat.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Her finding in relation to the evidence of PW20 is that there was no opportunity for the respondents to have given the oral instructions to PW20 in view of the stringent procedure in Ganad Media with regard to the approvals for the issuance of payment vouchers. It therefore follows, going by the learned Sessions Court Judge s reasoning, that PW20 could not have been telling the truth when she testified that the respondents gave the oral instructions. In other words PW20 had deliberately lied to the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The credibility of a witness is primarily a matter for the trial court to decide. In this regard we are mindful of the principle that the appellate court will always be slow to interfere with findings of fact made by the trial court where such findings depended on the credibility of the witnesses. We must hasten to add however that it is also entrenched principle that the appellate court can and will interfere if the trial court's finding of fact is perverse and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence or is against the probabilities of the case. We do not find it necessary to cite any authority for this trite proposition of law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In finding PW20 to be an untruthful witness, it is clear to us that the learned trial judge's opinion was influenced and shaped by the following factors:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In our view these factors taken cumulatively or individually are not justifiable reasons for finding PW20 to be deceitful. As to the first factor, we need only say that PW20 was not an accomplice or <i>particeps criminis</i>, whose evidence required independent corroboration. Even then the requirement of corroboration in such cases is more a matter of prudence rather than a strict requirement of law. Neither was PW20 a child witness. It was therefore wrong for the learned Sessions Court Judge to require corroboration when none is required by law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As for the second factor, it is our view that the learned Sessions Court Judge had given undue and unwarranted weight to the fact that PW20 was given a double promotion and triple pay. She surmised that this was a reward to PW20 for giving evidence against the respondents. With due respect to the learned Sessions Court Judge this is pure conjecture and should not have been made, particularly in the face of evidence that PW20's promotion was due to the outflow of key employees at the material time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In any case there is no law to say that the evidence of an interested witness must not be believed. Every witness who has taken oath to tell the truth must be presumed to be worthy of credit unless he proves or is shown by the evidence to be otherwise. Nothing can be more repulsive than for a witness to lie under oath in order that the accused may be convicted of the offence charged. Such witness is liable to contempt proceedings or to prosecution for perjury under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;195.;;">s 195 of the Penal Code</LINK>. Be that as it may the court should only make such finding on any witness upon clear proof and on being satisfied that the witness had deliberately lied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As for the discrepancies and lapses of memory within and between the testimonies of PW20 and some of the other prosecution witnesses, especially PW1 and PW2, we find that they relate to insignificant and trivial matters such as the actual date PW20 was appointed the Acquisition manager, the details pertaining to the preparation of the payment vouchers, the time and the date the oral instructions were given by the respondents and whether the respondents had given the oral instructions together or individually.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Discrepancies such as these should be ignored as more often than not they are a result of honest mistakes or lapses in memory rather than falsehood. It must be remembered that the witnesses were recalling events that took place long before they were called to give evidence. Memories do fade with the passage of time and the courts do recognise human fallibility in recollection. Absolute unadulterated truth is not possible. Perfect testimony is an illusion, in fact a sure sign of concoction. It is only when a witness has demonstrably and undoubtedly lied on material points (and not just on any point) that his evidence must be treated with caution or discarded altogether.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In determining whether a witness is telling the truth or otherwise on any material issue the best guide is for the court to see whether his testimony passes the test of probability. There may be discrepancies in his testimony or between his testimony and the testimonies of other witnesses or he may even have lied on one or two points, but if his testimony on a point that really matters, ie a point that determines the guilt or otherwise of the accused is not inherently improbable and is consistent with the truth having regard to the totality of the evidence and the probabilities of the case, his evidence must be accepted unless for some other reason or reasons it is unsafe to be acted upon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is the probative value of a witness's testimony that the court is concerned with. It is important to keep this in mind so as to avoid being sidetracked by trivialities and non-issues and in the process missing the trees for the forest. In the present case we found nothing inherently improbable in the testimony of PW20 that it was the respondents who orally instructed her to prepare the payment vouchers. There is nothing unusual about giving such oral instructions. The fact that stringent procedures were in place in Ganad Media for the approval and issuance of payment vouchers does not mean that the respondents could not issue the instructions orally, given their dominant positions as company directors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> There is therefore no basis in our view for counsel in the courts below and before us to question why such important instructions were given orally and not in writing and why PW20 did not take down notes as to the date and nature of the instructions. In all likelihood PW20 would have done just that, if indeed her intention was to frame up the respondents as alleged, with the written notes as proof of the respondents' wrongdoing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Contrary to the concurrent findings of the Sessions Court and the High Court, PW20's evidence does not stand alone. It is supported by the documentary evidence and the surrounding circumstances. For the payments to be made, someone in authority in Ganad Media must have given the instructions. Having regard to the totality of the evidence and the probabilities of the case, PW20 could not have been lying when she said that it was the two respondents who gave the oral instructions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The learned Sessions Court Judge being the trial judge was no doubt in a better position than us to judge PW20's credibility as a witness but in our view her rejection of PW20's evidence on the premise that the respondents had no opportunity to give the oral instructions due to the company's stringent procedure in approving payment vouchers is perverse and does not stand up to reason.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We wish to reiterate that the burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, not beyond the shadow or flicker of a doubt. That is the degree of proof required and there is no dearth of authority on what constitutes reasonable doubt. Unless this is properly understood, there is the danger that in giving maximum evaluation to the evidence of the prosecution at the close of its case or in considering the evidence of the accused at the close of the defence case, a burden that is heavier and more onerous than what the law requires is demanded of the prosecution. Justice is not better served by acquitting a guilty man than it is to convict an innocent one.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Perhaps we should reproduce the oft-quoted pronouncement of Lord Denning in <i>Miller v. Minister of Pensions</i> [1947] 2 All ER 372 to better understand the correct burden that the law places on the prosecution:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> For reasons aforesaid we found that both the Sessions Court and the High Court were wrong in finding that no <i>prima facie</i> case had been established against the respondents in respect of the three charges. In the result we set aside the order of acquittal and substituted it with an order that the defence be called.</p>
