    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal in affirming the High Court's decision which found that the appellant's registered trade mark had been wrongly entered or entered without sufficient cause and as a result should be expunged pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act 1976 ('the Act')</LINK>. At the material time, the respondent had been entrusted by the Ministry of Youth and Sports with all responsibilities over the rights, ownership and management of the tiger stripes design for sports attire to be worn by all Malaysian athletes representing the country. Consequently, the respondent appointed a manufacturer by the name of Antioni to produce and supply the sports attire bearing the tiger stripes design. Following that, the appellant was appointed as contract supplier by the respondent to produce sports attire bearing the tiger stripes design. Three years later, the appellant claimed to be the first user of the tiger stripes design as a trade mark in the course of trade and applied for registration of the design under the Act, while it was still a supplier of sports goods to the respondent. Following the discovery of the registration of the tiger stripes design trade mark in the name of the appellant, the respondent commenced proceedings for, amongst others, common law passing off; and rectification of the appellant's registered trademarks from the register. In this appeal, there were two parts to the question of law posed by the appellant, ie whether a claim for common law ownership over an indicator as a trade mark could be answered by asking (i) who designed the said indicator and (ii) who was first in time to use the said indicator as a trade mark in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The common law proprietorship of a trade mark was not based on who first designed or created the trade mark or source identifier in question. It required that the claimant establish its entitlement to it by reason of its use as a trade mark on goods in the course of its trade rather than by showing that it was the creator of the identifier. In the present case, it was not the law that by it having created the tiger stripes design and irrespective of its activities, the respondent was automatically the common law owner it created as a trade mark. Thus, the fact that the respondent had created the said design did not of itself give it the right to the design as a trade mark. (paras 37-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> From the evidence adduced, the appellant came into the picture only because of its appointment to produce and supply sports attire bearing the tiger stripes design to the respondent in 2006. The appellant first used the tiger stripes design as a supplier upon orders from the respondent. Therefore, the appellant was no more than a contract manufacturer who affixed the tiger stripes design to the sports attire made to the respondent's order, whereas the respondent was directly involved in business activity for commercialisation of the tiger stripes design through its contract suppliers. In the result, the respondent was in fact and in law the first user of the tiger stripes design. (paras 59, 60 &amp; 63)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> It was self-evident the respondent had used the tiger stripes design 'in the course of trade' when it appointed Antioni and later the appellant as a contract supplier of the goods bearing the tiger stripes design. Further, from a perusal of the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;3.;;">s 3 of the Act</LINK>, there was no word in it to support the restrictive interpretation that the use in 'a trade mark sense' could only be achieved through the manufacturing and sale of sports attire with the tiger stripes design embodied and that goodwill could only be achieved through such business activities. To agree to such a contention would mean disregarding other forms of use in the course of trade such as obtaining sponsorships, granting merchandising rights and other licensing rights over the use of the tiger stripes design. (paras 65-66)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Undeniably, the respondent was a non-trading entity. However, the respondent being a sports organisation with the statutory duties under the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_29;;">National Sports Council of Malaysia Act 1971</LINK> was fully empowered and entitled pursuant to acquire, hold and enjoy movable and immovable assets and properties of every description including those over the trade marks namely of the tiger stripes design and to further deal with such rights including to deal with or to develop such rights belonging to the respondent. The respondent was also empowered and entitled to enter into any contract including any or all such contracts for commercialisation of the tiger stripes design as well as to deal with it by way of appointment and engaging contractors, including the appellant, for the manufacture and supply of all such goods using the tiger stripes design under contract. Hence, the respondent did not need to be a 'trading entity' before it could be said that the respondent had used the tiger stripes design 'in the course of trade'. (paras 69-73)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant case, the respondent had established goodwill and reputation through sports promotional and advancement activities in the purchase and distribution of the sports goods bearing the tiger stripes as early as in 2005 and had this intention to use the design as a mark in the course of trade, even if there was no evidence of any immediate use. Accordingly, on the factual matrix of the case, the respondent had enjoyed goodwill and reputation in the sports attire bearing the design even before the appellant applied for registration. (paras 75, 78 &amp; 79)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Azahar Mohamed FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant, Mesuma Sports Sdn Bhd (the defendant in the High Court), pursuant to leave of this Court to Appeal against the whole decision of the Court of Appeal that affirmed the judgment of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The subject matter of the dispute between Mesuma Sports Sdn Bhd and the respondent, Majlis Sukan Negara Malaysia (the plaintiff in the High Court) revolved around 'the tiger stripes design' over goods such as sports attire for the use of all Malaysian athletes representing the country in various sports events held within the country and beyond. This case concerned the tort of passing off, which is a common law tort that can be used to enforce unregistered trade mark rights. To a large extent what is in contention in the present appeal is the common law ownership right to the tiger stripes design as an unregistered trade mark in a trade mark sense in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We shall be referring to parties in this judgment in the capacity as they were in the High Court, namely the appellant as the defendant and the respondent as the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff is a statutory body established under the provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_29;;">National Sports Council of Malaysia Act 1971 (Act 29)</LINK>. Its main responsibility is the promotion of sports in the country.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The defendant is a private limited company and is in the business of supplying sports apparel, equipment, accessories and sports goods generally. It had been a contract supplier of the same to the plaintiff since 1990.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In 2005, the Ministry of Youth and Sports (the Ministry) with the cooperation of the plaintiff and a company known as 59 icons Sdn Bhd organised a New Jersey Design Competition (Competition) to design a new motif and colour for sports attire to be worn by all Malaysian athletes representing the country in sports events held within the country and internationally. The Ministry reserved its right to claim ownership of all drawings, artwork or concepts submitted by participants in the Competition and to use them for any purpose. The tiger stripes design was selected as the winning design of the Competition. After final selection, the Ministry on 14 November 2005 officially launched the said design. Subsequently, the Ministry entrusted the plaintiff with all responsibilities over the rights, ownership and management of the tiger stripes design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> What happened next, was that, all Malaysian athletes who took part in the SEA Games held in Manila, Philippines in 2005 wore the sports attire incorporating the tiger stripes design for the first time. The plaintiff had appointed a manufacturer by the name of Antioni to produce and supply the sports attire bearing the tiger stripes design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Not long afterwards, the defendant was appointed as contract supplier by the plaintiff to produce sports attire bearing the tiger stripes design to be worn by Malaysian athletes for the 2006 Asian Games in Doha.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It is important to keep in mind that some three years later, on 9 July 2009, the defendant claimed to be the first user of the tiger stripes design as a trade mark in the course of trade applied for registration of the design under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;;">Trade Marks Act 1976 (the Act)</LINK>, while it was still a supplier of sports goods to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 11 February 2011, the tiger stripes design was registered as a trade mark by the Registrar of Trade Marks in the name of the defendant as the proprietor in the register for a period of ten years from 9 July 2009 to 9 July 2019 in Class 18 and Class 25 under the Act and in respect of "sporting apparels, equipment and accessories and sports clothing" vide Trade Mark No: 09011365 and Trade Mark No: 09011366, respectively. The defendant admitted that its registered trade mark was entirely adapted from the plaintiff's tiger stripes design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In relation to this, the Court of Appeal observed that whilst the plaintiff had expended time, effort and expense to develop the tiger stripes design, the defendant had hardly expended any <i>bona fide</i> effort to design it, as the defendant merely copied the design of the plaintiff. Indeed, there was no material difference or distinction between the plaintiff's tiger stripes design and the defendant's trade mark. They were almost identical, as the defendant had copied the tiger stripes design of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Going back a little, on or around 15 January 2010, the plaintiff filed for registration under the Act the same tiger stripes design as a trade mark. As it turned out, the Registrar of Trade Marks objected to the plaintiff's application on the ground that the defendant had earlier claimed to be the first user of the tiger stripes design as a trade mark. The plaintiff's trade mark applications remained pending at the time of commencement of the High Court action filed by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The dispute in the present appeal arose as soon as the plaintiff was made aware of the registration of the tiger stripes design trade mark in the name of the defendant. As events unfolded, on or about 13 January 2012, the plaintiff commenced a High Court action against the defendant. The plaintiff asserted the following causes of action, namely, (i) common law traditional passing off (ii) registered design infringement (iii) copyright infringement and (iv) rectification of the defendant's registered Trade Marks No: 09011365 (Class 18) and No: 09011366 (Class 25) from the register, which was premised on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">ss 45(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">46(1) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It must be noted at this juncture that of the causes of action pleaded, the plaintiff did not pursue its copyright and industrial design infringement claims in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In its defence, the defendant, among others, maintained that it was the true legal owner of said trade mark registration on the basis that it was the first user of the said tiger stripes design as a trade mark on sports attire in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The High Court found in favour of the plaintiff. The High Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to rightful proprietorship and use of the tiger stripes design as the plaintiff together with the Ministry was the first conceiver and first user of the said design, and thereafter, since 14 November 2005, had earned substantial goodwill and reputation over the design which was distinctive to the plaintiff and never of the defendant in any manner whatsoever. In allowing the plaintiff's claim, the High Court held that the defendant had invaded the plaintiff's intangible property right in its product by misappropriating the tiger stripes design which had become recognised by the public as distinctive of the plaintiff; on the evidence, the public would only associate the tiger stripes design with the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The High Court also found that the defendant's registered trade mark had been wrongly entered or enteredwithout sufficient cause and as a result, should be expunged pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. Consequently, the register of Trade Mark was rectified by the removal of Trade Mark No: 09011365 (Class 18) and No: 09011366 (Class 25) registered under the name of the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> On appeal by the defendant, the Court of Appeal unanimously agreed with the decision of the High Court and dismissed the defendant's appeal with costs. In dismissing the defendant's appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the defendant's registration of the tiger stripes design as its trade mark was wrongfully made without sufficient cause and wrongfully remained on the Trade Mark Register pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> and that the application was filed in bad faith pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">s 46(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Court of Appeal found that the owner and first user of the tiger stripes design was the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had used the design as its trade mark in the course of trade, in the broader sense. When the defendant supplied the sports attire bearing the tiger stripes design for the plaintiff, it had supplied them solely for the business of the plaintiff and none other. Accordingly, it was held that the High Court was correct in expunging the defendant's trade mark from the register of Trade Mark for the reason that the defendant was neither the proprietor nor the first user of the tiger stripes design. The defendant did not have a good title to the design and the registration thereof was without any legal basis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Question Of Law On Appeal To The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> This court had granted the defendant leave to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal relating to common law ownership right to the tiger stripes design as a trade mark, and the principal question of law is:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The appeal to this court only relates to the plaintiff's application in the High Court to expunge the defendant's registered trade mark. As can be seen, there are two parts to the question of law posed. First, whether a claim for common law ownership over an indicator as a trade mark could be answered by asking who designed the said indicator. And secondly, whether a claim for common law ownership over an indicator as a trade mark could be answered by asking who was first in time to use the said indicator as a trade mark in a trade mark sense in the course of trade. The second part of the question is very factual; it clearly would depend on the facts of a particular case as to who was first in time to use said indicator or source identifier as a trade mark in a trade mark sense in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It is noteworthy that, as stated by learned counsel for the defendant, the question posed in this appeal requires this court's determination on the requisites for common law ownership's entitlement to an identifier as a trade mark and the nature and type of goodwill that must be attached to such goodwill and reputation for the enforcement of such common law trade mark ownership against others by an action of traditional passing off. The question would therefore address the principle of common law proprietorship over a trade mark for purposes of commencement of a passing off cause of action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The prayer asked for by the plaintiff in the High Court action, among others, was a relief based on its allegation of passing off of the traditional kind, which essentially was misrepresentation of sports attire of the defendant as and for the same of the plaintiff by the use of tiger stripes design. It has to be emphasised that the law of passing off governs the protection of common law or unregistered trade marks. The tort of passing off is a common law wrong. Passing off does not protect the use of a mark, name, get up or any other sign which is distinctive of a business, but the goodwill of the business that uses them. Goodwill accumulated through use is the property right that is protected (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_313;"><i>McCurry Restaurant (KL) Sdn Bhd v. McDonald's Corporation</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 313</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 774; [2009] 3 CLJ 540 and <i>The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Muller &amp; Co's Margarine Limited</i> [1901] AC 217).

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In our jurisdiction, if the proprietor of common law or unregistered trade mark does not wish to file for registration under the Act, which he is entitled to, his common law right to the mark is nevertheless preserved by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;82.;;">s 82(2) of the Act</LINK> which provides "... notwithstanding subsection (1) nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the right of action against any person for passing off goods or services as those of another person or the remedies in respect of thereof".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> As we shall see later in this judgment, the determination of the question posed is crucial in the present appeal as it was the plaintiff's contention that the defendant had no such valid claim to registration under the Act of the tiger stripes design based on the plaintiff's ownership and use, and who initiated this rectification action as a result, to remove or expunge the same. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's trade mark registration was entry which was wrongfully made without sufficient cause and/or was wrongfully remained on the Trade Mark Register and was filed in bad faith.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Two provisions of the Act are relevant, which provide a good starting point. The first is <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a)</LINK>, which prescribes, with the necessary emphasis, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> There was not much dispute that the plaintiff was a person aggrieved and therefore had sufficient <i>locus standi </i>to initiate this present cause of action against the defendant for rectification of the defendant's tiger stripes design trade mark. In fact, the point as to whether the plaintiff was a person aggrieved had been settled by this court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_742;"><i>McLaren International Ltd v. Lim Yat Meen</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 742</LINK>; [2009] 5 MLJ 741; [2009] 4 CLJ 749 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_211;"><i>LB (Lian Bee) Confectionery Sdn Bhd v. QAF Limited</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 211</LINK>; [2012] 4 MLJ 20; [2012] 3 CLJ 661 (see also <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_3_879;"><i>Agricultural And Processed Food Products Export Development Authority; Of India (Apeda) &amp; Ors v.

    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> A person aggrieved is a person who has used his mark as a trade mark or who has a genuine and present intention to use his mark as a trade mark in the course of a trade which is the same as or similar to the registered trade mark that the person wants to be removed from the register. The person must be someone who has some element of legal interest, right or legitimate expectation in its own mark which is being substantially affected by the presence of the registered trade mark. The interest and right must be legal or lawful.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Proprietorship Of Trade Mark</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The more difficult question in this case is whether the defendant's tiger stripes designs trade mark was in fact an entry which had been wrongly made or entered without sufficient cause in the register under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1) of the Act</LINK>. It was the contention of the plaintiff's learned counsel that the defendant's trade mark registration was wrongly made or entered without sufficient cause in the register based on any or all of the following facts: the defendant was never the creator or designer and was not the lawful common law proprietor of the tiger stripes design device and therefore had made a wrongful claim to be proprietor and had practised fraud on the Trade Mark Registrar. At all material times, the plaintiff was the common law proprietor of the tiger stripes design. The plaintiff took the stand that on account that it was the common law owner of the tiger stripe trade design, which it said was similar to the defendant's registered trade mark, the defendant's trade mark should therefore be expunged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">ss 45</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;46.;;">46 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The contending views of the defendant may be summarised as follows. The defendant was at all material times, the common law owner of the tiger stripes design. Relying on the case of <i>Al Bassam Trade Mark</i> [1995] RPC 511, common law ownership to a trade mark required the plaintiff to establish its entitlement to it, not by showing that it was the creator or the identifier of the tiger stripes design, but rather, by reason of its use as a trade mark on goods in the course of its trade. The plaintiff's case, which was wrongly premised according to the defendant, was that, by it having created the tiger stripes design and irrespective of its activities, it was automatically the common law owner of the tiger stripes design that it had created as a trade mark. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff was the creator and lawful owner of the tiger stripes design but the defendant contended it was the lawful holder of the tiger stripes design trade mark on the ground that it was the first user of it as a trade mark in the course of trade. The defendant was a common law owner of the design by reason of its first and extensive use of the same in respect of sports attire.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The rival contentions of the parties bring into focus the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;25.;;">s 25(1) of the Act</LINK>, which provides that any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used or proposed to be used by him may make application to the Registrar for the registration of that mark in the register in the prescribed manner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The issue raised and argued by both sides turned upon this fundamental question: who can rightfully claim to be a proprietor of a trade mark under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;24.;;">s 25(1) of the Act</LINK>. The plaintiff was the creator of the tiger stripes design. That much was not in dispute. On this point, as submitted by learned counsel for the defendant, it was evident from the judgment of the High Court that it had also applied the copyright law concept and principle of there being expended skill effort and time in the creation of the disputed tiger stripes design to give to the plaintiff a common law right to title and ownership of the disputed identifier as a trade mark for the purposes of sustaining a cause of action in passing off. It appears that in justifying its finding that the plaintiff was the common law and unregistered trade mark owner of the disputed identifier of the tiger stripes design, the High Court relied upon and accepted the history surrounding the conceptualisation and creation of the tiger stripes design without bearing in mind that the dispute was one over the common law trade mark ownership rights over the disputed identifier. It was further argued by learned counsel for the defendant that the High Court had been unwarily influenced by the act of creation and conceptualisation of the disputed tiger stripes design in its determination of common law rights and ownership of a trade mark.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In the present case, it is pertinent to note that the evidence surrounding the conceptualisation of the disputed tiger stripes design had been put forward initially by the plaintiff to support its contention that it was the copyright owner (not trade mark owner) of the said design. It must be remembered that the copyright ownership claim had subsequently been dropped by the plaintiff in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We pause to observe at this point that conceptualisation of any works falling within such category of works protectable by copyright and subject to there being sufficient effort, skill and time having been expended in its conceptualisation, creation and reduction into material form is a statutory requirement under our Copyright Act 1987 (see<i>Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v. William Hill (Football) Ltd</i> [1964] 1 All ER 465 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_1_249;"><i>Radion Trading Sdn Bhd v. Sin Besteam Equipment Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRH 249</LINK>; [2010] 9 MLJ 648; [2010] 6 CLJ 334). It appears that the High Court had not properly considered and appreciated this and made no distinction between the legal requisites for copyright ownership and common law ownership of unregistered trade mark.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We note in this regard that the Court of Appeal in the instant case, whilst in agreement that the ownership of a trade mark to qualify for registration "is determined by first use which is a question to be determined by the court", further held there is a second element that must be met to satisfy "first use" it being the need to show authorship of the mark as well when it said "... Thus, it is important to determine who in fact and in law is the rightful proprietor of the design, the entity that has the proprietary right to the design in the sense that it has the absolute right to it".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> This part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal raised some vexing issues on the question as to what is the basis for trade mark proprietorship. The Court of Appeal also made no such distinction between copyright ownership of the tiger stripes design and common law ownership of it as a trade mark.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the defendant to this extent. Whilst the creator or designer of an indicator as a trade mark or source identifier may well be the copyright owner or registered design owner, the person is not automatically the trade mark owner. He may enforce his copyright or industrial design right but not necessarily his trade mark rights. There is a clear distinction between the creator of a mark and user of a mark. To put the point differently, common law proprietorship is not based on who first designed or created the trade mark or source identifier in question. The common law ownership to a trade mark requires the claimant establishing its entitlement to it not by showing that it is the creator of the identifier but rather, by reason of its use as a trade mark on goods in the course of its trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> To be more specific, in the context of the present case, it is not the law that by it having created the tiger stripes design and irrespective of its activities, the plaintiff was automatically the common law owner it created as a trade mark. The fact that the plaintiff had created the said design did not of itself give it the right to the design as a trade mark. It must be borne in mind that the assertion of who conceptualised the tiger stripes design was initially put forth with a view of supporting the plaintiff's contest for copyright ownership of the same. The plaintiff subsequently dropped its copyright ownership claim. This point has been made earlier but deserves to be reiterated. That aspect of intellectual property right is separate and distinct from common law ownership of the tiger stripes as a trade mark, the latter of which is determined by first 'user' of the tiger stripes design in a distinctive way as a trade mark in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The law governing the foundation, which led to common law proprietorship over a trade mark or source identifier, as we have summarised above, has been well settled. The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1996_3_247;"><i>Fazaruddin Ibrahim v. Parkson Corporation Sdn Bhd</i> [1996] 3 MLRH 247</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 685; [1997] 2 CLJ 863 reiterates the established legal position under common law that a first user of a mark is lawfully entitled to use the said mark. In the case of <i>Fazaruddin Ibrahim v. Parkson Corporation Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, the court held that in common law, the first person who uses a trade mark becomes the proprietor of the mark. Abdul Malik Ishak J (as he then was) said the following:</p>

      <b>[40]</b> In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_696;"><i>Lim Yew Sing v. Hummel International Sports &amp; Leisure A/S</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 696</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 7; [1996] 4 CLJ 784, the Court of Appeal held that there was nothing unlawful under the Act for a Malaysian trader to become the registered proprietor of a foreign mark used for similar foreign goods provided that the foreign mark had not been used at all in Malaysia.

      <b>[42]</b> This principle is consistent with other jurisdictions. The principle of law was explained in the UK Court of Appeal decision in <i>Al Bassam Trade Mark (supra)</i> where the court affirmed the principle that proprietorship under common law is not defined by the trade mark legislation but from first use. The provisions of the Act are broadly <i>in pari materia </i>with the UK legislation at the material time. Ward LJ held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Ward LJ further held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In a separate concurring judgment, Morritt LJ also emphasised that proprietorship of an unregistered trade mark is determined by first use:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The case of <i>Al Bassam Trade Mark (supra)</i> was followed by a Singapore case, that is, '<i>DALIC Trade Mark; Sifco Industries Inc v. Dalic SA</i> [1998] 2 SLR 231. It was held in that case, among others, that a trade mark was not registrable unless the person claiming to be the proprietor had first used it in relation to goods or services in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In <i>North Shore Toy Company Limited v. Charles L Stevenson Limited</i> [1974] RPC, the Supreme Court of New Zealand held that a person may become the owner of a common law trade mark by usage. On this, McMullin J said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Thus, the well-settled legal requisites necessary for the acquisition of common law trade mark rights over an indicator and identifier for the commencement of any passing of cause of action has always been premised on a factual requirement for the distinctive use of the indicator or identifier in a trade mark sense in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> So we would hold that he who first uses a trade mark owns the said trade mark under common law and that such common law ownership would in turn entitle him to file for trade mark application as a <i>bona fide</i> applicant, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;25.;;">s 25(1) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The central question which we must then ask here is: Who was the first in time to use the tiger stripes design as a trade mark in the course of trade?</p>
    <p>
      <b>First And Prior User Of The Tiger Stripes Design</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> On this, the key issue to be determined by this court is whether the plaintiff had used the tiger stripes design as a trade mark in the trade mark sense and in the course of trade, at any time before the defendant's application for registration of the tiger stripes design on 9 July 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The question must be approached on the basis of the definition in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;3.;;">s 3 of the Act</LINK>, which provides that trade mark means, except in relation to Part XI, a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods or services for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services and a person having the right either as proprietor or as registered user to use the mark whether with or without an indication of the identity of that person, and means, in relation to Part XI, a mark registrable or registered under the said Part XI.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The construction of the definition of a trade mark contained in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;3.;;">s 3 of the Act</LINK> is a matter of importance in this case. The task of the court is to give full effect to the provisions, which the legislature has enacted. The court must begin its task of interpretation by carefully considering the language used.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The operative words are 'in the course of the trade'; the mark must be used in the course of trade to indicate that the goods bearing the same mark originate from the same source. These are undeniably very wide-ranging words. The term 'trade' is very wide. The word 'trade' used in the provision is not defined. In constructing and interpreting the meaning of a word used in the Act, the ordinary meaning of the work must be applied unless there is a clear ambiguity (see <i>Duport Steels Ltd v. Sirs</i> [1980] 1 WLR 142). We do not see anything ambiguous in the provision. The word in question therefore should be given its plain and ordinary meaning (see<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_407;"><i>Chin Choy &amp; Ors v. Collector Of Stamp Duties</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 407</LINK>; [1979] 1 MLJ 169 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_239;"><i>Calamas Sdn Bhd v. Pentadbir Tanah Batang Padang</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 239</LINK>; [2011] 5 CLJ 125. Its scope of meaning and application can be seen by referring to the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i>, 9th edn: Trade, is defined as, among others, business conducted for profit, business of a specified nature, a transaction with a person for a thing. In <i>Aristoc Ltd v. Rysta Ltd</i> [1945] RPC 65, Lord MacMillan in the course of his judgment said 'trade' is no doubt a wide word but its meaning must vary with and be controlled by its context.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In asserting its position that the plaintiff was not the first in time to use the tiger stripes design as a trade mark in the course of trade, the main thrust of the arguments of the defendant's learned counsel was grounded on the basis that the plaintiff was not a profit making organisation; hence the plaintiff was not an entity connected in the course of trade. He strenuously argued that both the High Court and the Court of Appeal were plainly wrong in having found that the plaintiff had used the disputed tiger stripes design as a trade mark in the course of trade in a distinctive way so as to have acquired goodwill in the tiger stripes design in the absence of any evidence that the plaintiff had at any material time used the disputed tiger stripes design as a source indicator in relation to goods despite there being no manufacturing and commercial sales of the goods of the disputed tiger stripes design in the conduct of the admitted activities of the plaintiff, which activities related to branding activities. He relied on the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;3.;;">s 3 of the Act</LINK> to support the argument that the mark must be used in the course of trade to connect the goods with that mark. He contended that the use in 'a trade mark sense' can only be achieved through the manufacturing and sale of goods with the tiger stripes design embodied and goodwill can only be achieved through business activities such as 'manufacturing, supplying and selling' the sports attire it had produced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The position taken by the plaintiff was quite straightforward. Learned counsel had put forward an argument as follows. As evidenced from the documentary exhibits, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that since 2005 the plaintiff had appointed manufacturers to supply sports attire bearing the said design. It claimed to be the first user of the tiger stripes design. He added that the appointment of these manufacturers was an act in the course of trade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> We now need to turn our attention to the judgment of the courts below, and look more closely at their findings on issues relating to the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> On the question whether the plaintiff was first in time to use the tiger stripes design in the course of trade, the High Court answered it in the affirmative and made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We also observe that the High Court held that the tiger stripes design was used by the plaintiff in a trade mark sense to indicate origin of the sports attire worn by Malaysian athletes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> The Court of Appeal upheld the findings of the High Court. Having carefully considered the facts of the case, the Court of Appeal expressed its conclusion that the plaintiff was the first user of the tiger stripes design in the course of trade in the following passage of its judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> In deciding on this issue, the point to note is that it was in evidence that upon the launch of the tiger stripes design in 2005, a manufacturer by the name of Antioni had been appointed by the plaintiff to produce and supply the sports attire bearing said design. From the irrefutable evidence, the defendant came into the picture only because of its appointment to produce and supply sports attire bearing the tiger stripes design to the plaintiff in 2006. The defendant first used the tiger stripes design as a supplier upon orders from the plaintiff. The point to be made here is that the defendant was appointed by the plaintiff to manufacture sports attire carrying the tiger stripes design with the first invoice issued on 11 December 2006 by the defendant all of which was paid by the plaintiff for the Asian Games in Doha.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> It is against the above background, the business transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant must be looked at. Bearing these matters in mind and so considered, it is plain for us to see that the defendant was no more than a contract manufacturer who affixed the tiger stripes design to the sports attire made to the plaintiff's order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In <i>Trade Mark Licensing </i>by Neil J Wilkof and Daniel Burkitt - 2nd edn, the learned authors at p 156 referred to situations of goods made to order as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned authors also stated at p 166 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Further at pp 167 to 168, the learned authors explained the scope of contract manufacturing arrangement:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> On the issue of the contract manufacturer's rights with respect to the trade mark, the learned authors added:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In the result, therefore, the plaintiff was in fact and in law the first user of the tiger stripes design. At all material times, the contractual position of the defendant was that of a supplier to the plaintiff through the defendant's appointment to manufacture and produce the tiger stripes design trade mark over sports attire ordered by the plaintiff. As a matter of fact, the plaintiff was directly involved in business activity for commercialisation of the tiger stripes design through its contract suppliers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> There is no doubt that the defendant's "first use" of the tiger stripes design arose from appointment as a contract supplier of goods bearing the same design to be worn by all Malaysian athletes for the Asian Games in 2006. By that we mean, as things stood, while the defendant might have manufactured the goods, and therefore it could very loosely be said that the goods "originated" from them, this does not by any stretch of the imagination, to equate with bestowing the right as proprietor of the mark on to the defendant. It is important to note the last point because bearing in mind that the defendant was only appointed as a contract supplier for the plaintiff, the defendant could not claim proprietorship of the tiger stripes design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> More significantly, it is self-evident and it stands to reason that the plaintiff had used the tiger stripes design "in the course of trade" when it appointed Antioni and later the defendant as a contract supplier of the goods bearing the tiger stripes design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The plain and natural interpretation of the phrase "in the course of trade" does not bear out the proposition advanced by learned counsel for the defendant that the use in 'a trade mark sense' can only be achieved through the manufacturing and sale of sports attire with the tiger stripes design embodied and goodwill can only be achieved through such business activities. We are quite unable to agree with his contention. From a perusal of the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;3.;;">s 3 of the Act</LINK>, we can find not a word in it to support the restrictive interpretation of learned counsel. An implication of learned counsel's contention, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal in the present case, and we respectfully agree, would mean disregarding other forms of use in the course of trade such as obtaining sponsorships, granting merchandising rights and other licensing rights over the use of the tiger stripes design. With respect, we would be wrong if we were to hold so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> In its activities, the plaintiff had used the tiger stripes design since 2005. Both the High Court as well as the Court of Appeal found that the use of the design was intended to be used by the plaintiff to indicate the origin of the sports attire supplied by the plaintiff to Malaysian athletes. We see no reason to doubt these concurrent findings of the courts below; we accept these findings. The plaintiff had used the tiger stripes design as an indicative of the origin of the sports attire.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> This is consistent with the definition of 'trade mark' provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;3.;;">s 3 of the Act</LINK>. Trade mark indicates source origin of goods to distinguish such goods from the like goods of others. Trade marks are always taken as indicative of the origin of the goods. The fundamental of a trade mark has always been it is a badge of origin and indicator of source origin (see <i>Irving's Yeast-Vite Ltd v. Horsenail</i> [1934] 51 RPC 110 and <i>Unidoor Ltd v. Marks &amp; Spencer PLC</i> [1988] RPC 275). It indicates trade source as stated by Lord Nicholls on behalf of the House of Lords in the case of <i>R v. Johnstone</i> [2003] 3 All ER 884, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Undeniably, the plaintiff is a non-trading entity. The plaintiff is not, in the normal sense, a trader. The plaintiff was created by Act 29 and is entrusted with various functions and duties thereunder. However, the plaintiff being a sports organisation with the statutory duties under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_29;4.;;">s 4(1)(d) of Act 29</LINK> to promote sports locally and internationally, as well as to participate in the development of sports in Malaysia was fully empowered and entitled pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_29;4.;;">s 4(2)(g)</LINK> to acquire, hold and enjoy movable and immovable assets and properties of every description including those over the trade marks namely of the tiger stripes design and to further deal with such rights including to deal with or to develop such rights belonging to the plaintiff. Flowing from the provisions, we should add that the plaintiff was also empowered and entitled to enter into any contract including any or all such contracts for commercialisation of the tiger stripes design as well as to deal with it by way of appointment and engaging contractors, including the defendant, for the manufacture and supply of all such goods using the tiger stripes design under contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The result is that pursuant to the above provisions, the plaintiff was duly and fully empowered to enter into any equity participation for the benefit of development of sporting enterprises, including the activity of commercialisation of the tiger stripes design for purposes of raising much needed sports development funds through receipt of funds from endorsements, sponsorships and other sports branding and commercialisation efforts in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> It is plain from the reading of the relevant provisions of Act 29 that the plaintiff was authorised to engage in commercial business that was incidental to its primary statutory objects; the plaintiff need not be a 'trading entity' before it can be said that the plaintiff had used the tiger stripes design 'in the course of trade'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The unreported case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2014_1058;"><i>ST John Ambulans Malaysia v. PJ Uniform Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] MLRHU 1058</LINK>, which was brought to our attention by learned counsel for the plaintiff is illustrative of the approach the court takes on this issue. There, the plaintiff, which was not at all material times engaged in commercial business, was recognised as a nonprofit charitable statutory body regulated by the St John Ambulance (Malaysia) Incorporation Act 1972 akin to the plaintiff's organisational status as a nonprofit sports governing body established and empowered under Act 29. On the issue of whether St John Ambulans was an entity connected "in the course of trade", the High Court correctly held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> In the same way, it is quite clear that the plaintiff need not be a 'trading entity' before it could be said that it had used the tiger stripes design 'in the course of trade'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> This leaves us to consider one final point. We have stated earlier that passing-off does not protect the use of a mark, name, get up or any other sign which is distinctive of a business, but the goodwill of the business that uses them. It is settled law that goodwill is an essential element of the tort. In the absence of any goodwill, a plaintiff has no cause of action. Goodwill comes in various forms, depending on the nature of the activities. Whether or not there is goodwill attached to a product in a particular case is a question of fact to be determined by the court. The degree or amount of goodwill will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence adduced at trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> As held by the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff had established goodwill and reputation through sports promotional and advancement activities in the purchase and distribution of the sports goods bearing the tiger stripes design to Malaysian athletes when worn during domestic, regional or international sporting competitions. The plaintiff by using the tiger stripes design in the course of trade owned the goodwill generated thereby in relation to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> In this regard, it has to be noted that goodwill has been liberally construed to include non-commercial business or undertakings. It is seen from the case of <i>British Diabetic Association v. Diabetic Society Ltd and Ors</i> [1995] 4 All ER 812 that the notion of trade in passing off action is given a wide context and that included activity of charitable organisations. This case elucidates the wide scope of a passing off action and element of goodwill. In the words of Walker J:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>More difficult questions arise as to whether a charity, trading or not, can maintain a passing-off action against another charity or against any other defendant who cannot properly be called a trader. In Australia, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales has stated: "We see no reason why an element essentially indistinguishable from commercial goodwill should not be attributed to a charitable organisation and be equally entitled to protection from the law."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> There follows a passage in the judgment of Walker J, which we accept as a correct statement of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> In all the circumstances, we reach to the conclusion that as early as 2005, the plaintiff had acquired goodwill and had this intention to use the design as a mark in the course of trade, even if there was no evidence of any immediate use.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> Therefore, at all material times, the use of the design as a mark by the plaintiff was not merely to 'evoke amongst Malaysians a feeling of trust, reliability, loyalty and recognition forthe work, activities and objectives' of the plaintiff and the Ministry as contended by the defendant. On the factual matrix of the case, the plaintiff had enjoyed goodwill and reputation in the sports attire bearing the design even before the defendant applied for registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> In consequence, our answer to the first part of the question posed, is in the negative and the second part is in the affirmative, in favour of the plaintiff. This appeal must therefore fail. We accordingly dismiss it with costs.</p>
