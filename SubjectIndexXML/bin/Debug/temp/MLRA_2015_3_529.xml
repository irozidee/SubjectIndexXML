    <p>The plaintiff - a Member of Parliament - had sued the defendants in the High Court following the publication of a news report in a newspaper edited, published and printed by the defendants. The report alleged the misbehavior of the plaintiff in challenging another Member of Parliament to a fist fight outside Parliament, during a debate in Parliament. The defendants raised the defences of justification and qualified privilege. The High Court rejected the defences and allowed the plaintiff's claim with general and aggravated damages. The defendants appealed to this court against both liability and quantum of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Although one of the grounds of appeal was that the news about the plaintiff was not defamatory, this court would agree with the plaintiff and the High Court judge that the news was defamatory of the plaintiff. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> On the evidence and established facts there was no justification to interfere with the findings of the High Court judge and his rejection of the defence of justification. Far from stating the truth, the report in the newspaper was nothing but a distortion of what actually transpired in Parliament. (paras 24 &amp; 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, this court, although bearing in mind the importance of the role of the press in disseminating information to the public and the importance of freedom of speech, was inclined to dismiss the defence of qualified privilege. On the facts of the present case, the following factors pointed in favour of the plaintiff. Firstly, the allegation against the plaintiff was a serious one, considering that he was a Member of Parliament and it was about his alleged unruly and aggressive behavior in Parliament. Secondly, although the reporter (DW1) said that the atmosphere then in Parliament during the debate was chaotic, yet neither DW1 nor the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as an editor, took steps to verify the facts by waiting for the <i>Hansard</i> report. Thirdly, there was no urgency to publish the news. Fourthly, the defendants made no effort to seek comments from the plaintiff on the incident, particularly, to obtain his version of what actually transpired. Fifthly, the news was not a matter of public importance. There was clearly malice on the part of the defendants as shown by the manner the incident was reported: there was a deliberate act of 'pick and choose', and 'blacking out' of facts that were favourable to the plaintiff. <i>Reynolds v.

      <b>(4)</b> Considering the status of the plaintiff as a Member of Parliament and his senior position in the PAS party, the seriousness of the allegation, and the fact that there was malice on the part of the defendants, the award of RM110,000 as aggravated damages was fair. (para 38)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants were the defendants at the High Court of Shah Alam, and are now appealing before this court against the High Court's decision. The respondent was the plaintiff at the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 19 August 2009, the learned High Court Judge of Shah Alam after a full trial found the defendants liable for defaming the plaintiff and had awarded the latter damages: RM20,000 in general damages, to be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant; RM20,000 in general damages, to be paid by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant; aggravated damages of RM110,000, to be paid by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Hence the appeal to this court. The appeal is against both liability and quantum of damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 21 May 2014, after having heard submissions, we had unanimously dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the High Court Judge on both liability and damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We shall now explain the grounds of our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the material time the plaintiff was a Member of Parliament (MP), an Opposition MP. He was also the head of the youth wing of the political party, known by the acronym 'PAS', and a member of the party's central working committee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Dato' Rejal Ahmad Arbee, was an employee of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad: he was the Group Editor of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant's newspaper, Berita Harian.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the publisher and printer of the Berita Harian.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The Berita Harian newspaper enjoys a nationwide circulation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The subject matter of the plaintiff 's defamation action is a piece of news published in the Berita Harian on 9 November 2002 under the heading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The undisputed facts, including the offending part of the news, are set out in paras 5 to 7 of the statement of claim. Briefly, the news alleged that the plaintiff had misbehaved himself and created a nuisance during a debate in Parliament on 8 November 2000 by challenging another Member of Parliament to a fist fight outside the Parliament building. The incident occurred during the debate on the plaintiff 's motion in Parliament on the alleged abuse of power on the part of the police force when taking action against a public gathering at Kampung Jalan Kebun, Kelang. The plaintiff avers in his statement of claim:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In para 8 of the statement of claim, the plaintiff explains why he alleges that the news is defamatory. He avers:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Is The News Defamatory?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Although in the present case one of the grounds of appeal is that the news about the plaintiff is not defamatory, we find no difficulty in agreeing with the plaintiff and the learned High Court Judge that the news is defamatory of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> So, we propose not to labour on this issue but to proceed to consider the two defences raised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Of Justification</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> One of the two defences raised by the defendants is the defence of justification. The defendants claim that what was published about the plaintiff in the newspaper report was a true account of what transpired in Parliament during the debate on 8 November 2000, in that the plaintiff did challenge a Member of Parliament of the constituency of Tampin, from the Barisan Nasional party (the ruling party), namely, one YB Shahziman Abu Bakar to a fist fight outside Parliament. The defendants relied on the following excerpts from the report in the <i>Hansard</i> that state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The plaintiff admits having uttered these words in Parliament. In fact, the parties in the action accept that the report in the <i>Hansard</i> on the Parliamentary proceedings was an authoritative report of the proceedings. However, the plaintiff in his evidence denied making the alleged challenge. It is the assertion of the plaintiff that the person who actually made the challenge (to a fight) to him was the said YB Shahziman; and that this is borne out by the <i>Hansard</i>. The plaintiff complains that the newspaper report in the Berita Harian was made in a selective manner and did not narrate in full of what had actually transpired in Parliament during the debate. In other words, the words (the alleged challenge) attributed to the plaintiff was not reported in the Berita Harian in the proper context. This is what the plaintiff said in evidence.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In order to appreciate fully the plaintiff 's evidence, we shall set out the relevant parts of the report in the <i>Hansard</i>. They read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The reporter of the Berita Harian who wrote the news in question, one Wan Hazmir Bakar (DW1), in his evidence, said that he was present in Parliament during the debate and he witnessed the incident. He said the atmosphere then was chaotic (riuh rendah). He admitted during cross-examination that at the time when he wrote his report for the Berita Harian he did not have the benefit of the <i>Hansard</i> report, which was only published a few days later after the event.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> If we are to scrutinise the above <i>Hansard</i> report and were to compare it with the newspaper report in question, we will find that there are obvious omissions of material facts in the latter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Besides DW1, the defence also called YB Shahziman as a witness (DW2). DW2 denied that he had behaved in a provocative manner. In his evidence he alleged that it was the plaintiff who made the challenge to a fight.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Thus there was conflicting evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (the Group Editor of Berita Harian) was not called by the defence to testify.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned trial judge, having evaluated the evidence, rejected the defence of justification. In the words of the learned judge, in his grounds of judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[24] With respect, we find that on the evidence and the established facts there is no justification to interfere with the above findings of the learned trial judge and his rejection of the defence of justification.</p>
    <p>[25] In our judgment, looking at the scenario in totality as to what really were the exchanges of words that took place between the plaintiff and YB Shahziman in Parliament, as revealed by the report in the <i>Hansard</i>, the learned trial judge was correct in rejecting the defence of justification.</p>
    <p>[26] Having examined the evidence, in particular the <i>Hansard</i>, we note - as did the learned trial judge - that there is failure on the part of the defendants to mention in their newspaper report on the following provocative conduct of YB Shahziman.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The defendants had also omitted from the newspaper report the following words uttered by the plaintiff in Parliament as reported in the <i>Hansard</i> which clearly show that the plaintiff was not the party that had acted in a provocative manner. He was merely responding to the challenge for a fight by the said YB Shahziman; and that the plaintiff had said twice that he came to Parliament not to fight with anyone but to participate in the debate:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Thus, as we see it, in the light of the <i>Hansard</i>, via the news in the Berita Harian under the heading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>the defendants had placed the plaintiff, wrongly, in a bad light, instead of YB Shahziman. In other words, far from stating the truth, the news in the Berita Harian is nothing but a distortion of what actually transpired in Parliament.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Of Qualified Privilege: The Reynolds Principles</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The other defence of the defendants is the defence of qualified privilege on the principles as enunciated in the House of Lords case of <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd</i> [2001] 2 AC 127 ('the Reynolds principles').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> This defence was also rejected by the learned trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Prior to the formulation of the <i>Reynolds</i> principles in 2001 by the House of Lords, the common law principles on qualified privilege are as stated by the English courts in a number of cases. For instance, in <i>Harrison v. Bush</i> [1855] 5 E &amp; B 344, Lord Campbell CJ stated the law as follows (at p 348):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In <i>Pullman v. Hill &amp; Co</i> [1891] 1 QB 524, Lord Esher MR said (at p 528):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In <i>Adam v. Ward</i> [1917] AC 309, Lord Atkinson emphasised the importance of reciprocity in the following words (at p 334):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Then came <i>Reynolds</i> case in 2001 which further develops the common law principles on qualified privilege. The scope of the defence of qualified privilege is now extended to what is known as 'responsible journalism'. This defence is best explained by <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i>, 12<sup>th</sup> edn (at pp 533-535, para 14.2):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In <i>Reynolds</i> Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead lists out the factors to be taken into account by the court in deciding as to whether or not an author of an impugned publication claiming responsible journalism is entitled to avail himself the defence of qualified privilege based on the <i>Reynolds</i> principles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> This is what the learned law lord said (at p 255):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Now, applying the factors above as enumerated by Lord Nicholls to the facts of the present case, but bearing in mind the importance of the role of the press in disseminating information to the public and the importance of freedom of speech, we are inclined to dismiss the defence of qualified privilege. For, on the facts of the present case, the factors point in favour of the plaintiff. Firstly, the allegation against the plaintiff is a serious one, considering that he is a Member of Parliament and it was about his (alleged) unruly and aggressive behavior in Parliament. Secondly, although DW1 said that the atmosphere then in Parliament during the debate was chaotic, yet neither the reporter (DW1) nor the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as an editor, took steps to verify the facts by waiting for the <i>Hansard</i> report. Thirdly, there was no urgency to publish the news. Fourthly, the defendants made no effort to seek comments from the plaintiff on the incident, particularly, to obtain his version of what actually transpired. Fifthly, the news is not a matter of public importance. In any event, on the facts, we find that clearly there was malice on the part of the defendants as shown by the manner the incident was reported: there was a deliberate act of 'pick and choose', and 'blacking out' of facts that were favourable to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>On Damages</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The only complaint of the defendants is on the award of aggravated damages. The defendants contend that the award of RM110,000 is excessive. On our part, considering the status of the plaintiff as a Member of Parliament and his senior position in the PAS party, the seriousness of the allegation, and the fact that there was malice on the part of the defendants, we are of the view that the award of RM110,000 as aggravated damages is fair.</p>
