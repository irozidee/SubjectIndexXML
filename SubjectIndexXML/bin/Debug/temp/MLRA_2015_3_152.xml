    <p>The appellant was an officer in the administrative service of the State of Johore who was seconded to the respondent to be its Director and General Manager. The respondent was a corporate body established under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;;">Johore Islamic Corporation Enactment 1 of 1976 ('the Enactment')</LINK>. The appellant served the respondent as its General Manager from 1 January 2003 until his resignation on 22 August 2005. He then went on mandatory retirement on 23 August 2005. The respondent brought an action against the appellant for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. The respondent claimed that the appellant made a payment of RM500,000.00 in favour of a joint venture company called Megamerge in his capacity as the respondent's General Manager, without obtaining the approval from the respondent's Board of Directors ('the board'). It was further claimed that withdrawals were made from the account of Megamerge, which the appellant was in control of and that the withdrawals could only have been made if the appellant had signed the related cheques as co-signatory. The appellant denied the allegations and claimed that all actions taken by him were authorised by the board and that it was the respondent that owed a fiduciary duty towards the appellant. He also denied any knowledge of the withdrawals made and denied signing any cheques as claimed. The High Court judge found for the respondent and awarded the respondent RM500,000.00 in special damages, amongst others. The appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was a fiduciary relationship between the respondent and the appellant as the appellant was a Director and General Manager of the respondent. The evidence showed that the appellant in the discharge of his duties as fiduciary, owed a duty of care to the respondent to act in the respondent's best interests. The respondent appointed the appellant as its nominee in Megamerge. The respondent being the appellant's principal was entitled to the single-minded loyalty of the appellant, its fiduciary. Megamerge was not the appellant's principal and the appellant owed no fiduciary duty to Megamerge. The appellant only owed a fiduciary duty to the respondent. (paras 22-24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The appellant being a fiduciary to the respondent must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest might conflict. The evidence showed that the appellant became a Director of Megamerge before the proposed joint venture was brought to the Board for approval. The minutes of the meetings chaired by the appellant did not indicate that the appellant had appraised the respondent's management about his directorship in Megamerge. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant conceded that he issued the first cheque without the approval of the board but gave the explanation that he was advised by his lawyer that the payment, though irregular, could be made. Fortunately for the respondent, its Finance Manager ('SP3') sought the advice of the State Legal Adviser who explained that she did so because the cheque was issued before the joint venture agreement ('JVA') was signed and without the approval of the board. The State Legal Adviser then instructed her to stop payment. The board agreed and the Chairman was informed. SP3 then prepared a memorandum to the bank to stop payment. The circumstances surrounding the first cheque were relevant to the extent that it indicated that the appellant placed himself in a position of conflict between his duty to the respondent and his interest in Megamerge. His conduct in issuing the first cheque to Megamerge without the approval of the Board showed that the appellant did not act in the respondent's best interest. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The appellant agreed with the respondent that there was no urgency to sign the JVA but Megamerge wanted the JVA to be signed quickly. He agreed that under the JVA, there was no requirement to pay an initial investment and that there was no time period specified for payment of the RM500,000.00. Despite his defence that the payment of RM500,000.00 was authorised by the respondent, in cross-examination the appellant admitted that he himself decided to make the said payment. Therefore by his own admission it was clear that the payment of RM500,000.00 to Megamerge was made without any authorisation from the Board. The appellant therefore acted negligently and breached his duty of care owed to the respondent. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The appellant admitted that despite the instructions given by the respondent to recover the monies, he only gave instructions to freeze the bank account of Megamerge. He did not give any instructions nor take any action to recover the monies paid out. Neither did he seek any assistance or advice on that matter. The Enactment contained specific provisions regarding the appellant's duties and responsibilities as the respondent's General Manager and officer. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;12.;;">Section 12 of the Enactment</LINK> provided, amongst others, that as General Manager he was bound to carry out the decisions of the respondent and the direction of the respondent's Chairman. The appellant's lack of action and disregard for the respondent's instructions to recover the monies, and his failure to seek assistance or advice on that matter although he had ample time to do so, were inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;12.;;">s 12 of the Enactment</LINK> and also <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;13A.;;">s 13A</LINK> which specifically stated <i>inter alia</i> that an officer or servant of the respondent should not cause detriment to the respondent. (paras 29-30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> With respect to the withdrawals made by Megamerge after the appellant's resignation as the respondent's General Manager, the appellant merely denied knowledge of those withdrawals although he agreed that he was one of the two co-signatories of cheques issued by Megamerge. It was pertinent to note that although on 22 August 2005 the appellant ceased to be the General Manager and Director of the respondent, and had gone on mandatory retirement on 23 August 2005, he remained as a Director of Megamerge until 21 February 2006 when he resigned from the Board of Megamerge. (paras 31-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The bank would not honour any cheque from Megamerge unless the cheque carried the required two signatures. The respondent did not appoint any replacement for the appellant in Megamerge. Therefore the only reasonable and plausible explanation for the successful withdrawals made by Megamerge was that the appellant must have been one of the two signatories who had signed the cheques. Those withdrawals occurred despite the appellant knowing that the monies were paid out to Megamerge without the respondent's authorisation and that the respondent wanted him to take action for the monies to be returned. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> On the totality of the evidence the appellant had acted negligently and had breached his fiduciary duties to the respondent. Therefore this action was properly instituted against the appellant and there was no merit in the appellant's appeal. (paras 34-35)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aziah Ali JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The respondent (the plaintiff in the court below) is a body corporate established under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;;">Johore Islamic Corporation Enactment 1 of 1976 ("the Enactment")</LINK>. The appellant (the defendant in the court below) was an officer in the administrative service of the State of Johore who was seconded to the respondent to be a Director and the General Manager of the respondent. The appellant served the respondent as its General Manager from 1 January 2003 until his resignation on 22 August 2005. On 23 August 2005 the defendant went on mandatory retirement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent's claim against the appellant is premised on breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. It is the respondent's case that due to such breach and negligence, it has suffered losses. Therefore the respondent claims against the appellant as follows:</p>
    <p>(a) RM500,000.00 as special damages;</p>
    <p>(b) interests, and</p>
    <p>(c) costs of RM10,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The learned judge of the High Court decided in favour of the respondent and allowed the respondent's claim as prayed, hence this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We have considered the submissions made by both parties and the record of appeal. We find no merit in the appeal. Consequently we dismissed the appeal with costs for the reasons we give below. In this judgment parties will be referred to as they were in the court below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The facts as found from the Appeal Record show that the defendant had circulated to the plaintiff 's Board of Directors ("the board") a paper proposing a joint venture between the plaintiff and a company known as Yasunaga Industries Sdn Bhd ("Yasunaga") to manufacture a product known as "Photo Squeenzer, DVD-R, CD-R" and other related products (exh P-18). According to the plaintiff 's Deputy General Manager II, Hajah Samiah bt Hj Abdul Rahim (PW1), it was the defendant who had promoted Yasunaga to the plaintiff. This was confirmed by the defendant in his testimony in crossexamination as follows:</p>
    <p>"Q: Boleh beritahu pegawai dalam PIJ yang buka pintu untuk bawa masuk Yasunaga?</p>
    <p>A: Saya atas nasihat peguam."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 5 February 2005, six out of the eight members of the plaintiff 's board had agreed to the proposal and that the defendant, as the plaintiff 's General Manager, be authorised to conduct negotiations with Yasunaga and to sign the joint venture agreement. At a meeting on 7 February 2005 chaired by the Chairman of the Committee for International Trade and Industry, Energy, Water and Communication, Johore, which was also attended by the defendant, representatives of Yasunaga briefed the attendees on the product which they proposed to manufacture in a joint venture with the plaintiff (exh P-17).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Yasunaga was introduced to the plaintiff 's management on 4 March 2005 at a meeting chaired by the defendant where the plaintiff 's management was briefed on the proposed joint venture (exh P-16). Another meeting chaired by the defendant was held on 17 March 2005 to discuss the draft joint venture agreement (exh P-15).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 21 March 2005 the defendant, in his capacity as the plaintiff 's General Manager, signed the joint venture agreement ("JVA"). In the JVA (exh P-2), it is stated amongst others that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The evidence showed that Megamerge, the joint venture vehicle, was incorporated on 27 Janaury 2005 (exh P-49). On 4 March 2005 the defendant and two others by the name of Wong Xin Yin and Leung Pui Lam were appointed Directors of Megamerge (exhs P-45 and P-48). On the same date, the original/first Directors of Megamerge resigned from its Board (exh P-47). On the same date too the three new Directors of Megamerge passed a resolution giving authority to the defendant and one Wong Kim Keong to operate the account of Megamerge at Bank Muamalat (M) Bhd at Johor Bahru (exh P46). Whilst the defendant had been appointed as a Director of Megamerge on 4 March 2005 PW1, who was also the plaintiff 's representative in Megamerge together with the defendant, was appointed to the Board of Megamerge on 21 March 2005, ie the date the JVA was signed (exh P-45).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On the same date of signing of the JVA, the defendant had signed a cheque for RM500,000.00 in favour of Megamerge which was deposited into the account of Megamerge at Bank Muamalat as the plaintiff 's initial investment. On 29 March 2005 Megamerge issued a cheque for RM200,000.00 as payment of deposit to a contractor for renovation works to be carried out on a factory (see exh P-13 Item 4.1.13(iii) at p 355 Appeal Record). The cheque was cleared for payment the same day. The balance remaining in the account of Megamerge on 31 March 2005 was RM300,113.05 (exh P-36 at p 398 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 30 March 2005 at a meeting between the Menteri Besar of Johore (who is the Chairman of the plaintiff by virtue of s 4 of the Enactment), the plaintiff 's Board and the defendant, a decision was made to stop all actions relating to the joint venture pending a due diligence being carried out (exh P-13 Item 4.1.8 at p 353). The defendant was directed to recover the RM500,000.00 and to freeze the account of Megamerge (exh P-13 Item 4.1.13 at p 355). The defendant acknowledged that he was directed to recover the RM500,000.00. He said that he had instructed one of his staff by the name of 'Fara' to take action to freeze the account. However he did not take any action to recover the RM500,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 22 August 2005 the defendant resigned as the plaintiff 's General Manager. With his resignation, the defendant automatically ceased to be a Director of the plaintiff (exh P-9 Item 1.4 at p 322 Appeal Record). According to PW1, the plaintiff did not appoint anybody to replace the defendant in Megamerge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On 27 October 2005 the plaintiff, through PW1, notified the company secretary of Megamerge about the defendant's mandatory retirement and that he was no longer a Director of Megamerge. The plaintiff instructed the company secretary to take immediate action to remove the defendant's name as one of the signatories in Megamerge (exh P-40). Approximately six months after his mandatory retirement, on 21 February 2006 the defendant resigned from the Board of Directors of Megamerge (exh P-38).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The plaintiff adduced evidence to show that between the date of the defendant's resignation as the plaintiff 's General Manager and the date of his resignation as a Director of Megamerge, three withdrawals amounting to RM270,000.00 were made by Megamerge from its account at Bank Muamalat as follows (exh P-36 at pp 403-404 Appeal Record):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The plaintiff 's claim against the defendant can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The defendant denied all the allegations made against him. It was the stand of the defendant that all actions taken by him were authorised by the plaintiff 's board and it was the plaintiff 's board which owes a fiduciary duty towards the plaintiff. He denied any knowledge of the withdrawals made in 2005 and denied that he had signed any cheque after his resignation as the plaintiff 's General Manager.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned judge allowed the plaintiff 's claim essentially for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The submissions made before us show that the primary issue for determination is whether there was a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, and if there was, whether the defendant has breached his duty of care owed to the plaintiff as its fiduciary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned counsel for the defendant, Encik Ibrahim Hashim contended that the defendant owed a duty not to the plaintiff but to Megamerge in which he was a nominee Director. The learned counsel for the plaintiff on the other hand contended that, being the General Manager of the plaintiff and the plaintiff 's nominee in Megamerge, the defendant owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff to protect the plaintiff 's interest in Megamerge, in which the plaintiff had 30% shareholding. It was contended that the defendant had acted negligently in breach of his fiduciary duty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The issue of whether the defendant is in a position of a fiduciary to the plaintiff has to be resolved primarily with reference to the nature of the defendant's relationship with the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We refer to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_1_526;"><i>Solid Investments Ltd v. Alcatel-Lucent (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 1 MLRA 526</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 785; [2014] 3 CLJ 73; [2014] 1 AMR 348, wherein the Federal Court referred to Snell's Equity, 32<sup>nd</sup> edn (2010) Thomson Reuters. At pp 172 to 178, the learned author stated that the accepted categories in which the courts presume the existence of a fiduciary relationship are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It is not disputed that the defendant was a Director and General Manager of the plaintiff. Following the abovementioned authority, it is clear that there existed a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty and fidelity. The nature of the fiduciary obligation is, amongst others, to act in good faith based on a relationship of trust and confidence. In the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_93;"><i>The Board Of Trustees Of The Sabah Foundation &amp; Ors v. Datuk Syed Kechik Syed Mohamed &amp; Anor</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 93</LINK>; [2008] 5 MLJ 469; [2008] 3 CLJ 221, the Federal Court in its judgment at p 107 states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It is thus implicit that in the discharge of his duties as a fiduciary, the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff to act in the best interest of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had appointed him as its nominee in Megamerge. The plaintiff being the defendant's principal was entitled to the single-minded loyalty of the defendant, its fiduciary. Megamerge was not the defendant's principal. We therefore disagree with the learned counsel for the defendant that the defendant owed a fiduciary duty to Megamerge and not to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The defendant being a fiduciary to the plaintiff must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict. The evidence shows that the defendant became a Director of Megamerge before the proposed joint venture with Yasunaga was brought to the plaintiff 's Board for approval. A perusal of the minutes of the meetings held on 4 March 2005 and on 17 March 2005 chaired by the defendant does not indicate that in both these meetings, the defendant had appraised the plaintiff 's management about his directorship in Megamerge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The defendant agreed with the learned counsel for the plaintiff that as the plaintiff 's General Manager, he had authority to sign cheques not exceeding RM500,000.00. There is in evidence that before the JVA was signed, the defendant had issued a cheque in the sum of RM500,000.00 to Megamerge without the approval of the board ("the first cheque"). The defendant in his testimony conceded that he had issued the first cheque without the approval of the Board but gave the explanation that he was advised by his lawyer that the payment, though irregular, could be made. Fortunately for the plaintiff, its Finance Manager Farahely bte Adnan (SP3) sought the advice of the State Legal Adviser. In her testimony she explained that she did so because the cheque was issued before the JVA was signed and without the approval of the board. According to SP3, the State Legal Adviser then instructed her to stop payment. The board agreed and the Chairman was informed. SP3 then prepared a memorandum dated 22 March 2005 to the bank to stop payment (exh P-53).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The circumstances surrounding the first cheque are relevant to the extent that they indicate that the defendant had placed himself in a position of conflict between his duty to the plaintiff and his interest in Megamerge. His conduct in issuing the first cheque to Megamerge without the approval of the board showed that the defendant had not acted in the best interest of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The defendant agreed with the learned counsel for the plaintiff that there was no urgency to sign the JVA but Megamerge had wanted the JVA to be signed quickly. He agreed that under the JVA, there was no requirement to pay an initial investment and that there was no time period specified for payment of the RM500,000.00. Despite his defence that the payment of RM500,000.00 (the subject matter of the plaintiff 's claim) was authorised by the plaintiff, in cross examination the defendant had admitted that he himself had decided to make the said payment (p 157 Appeal Record). Thus by his own admission it is clear that the payment of RM500,000.00 to Megamerge was made without any authorisation from the plaintiff 's board. The defendant has therefore acted negligently and had breached his duty of care owed to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The defendant had also admitted that despite the instructions given by the plaintiff to recover the monies, he had only given instructions to 'Fara' to freeze the bank account of Megamerge. He did not give any instructions nor take any action to recover the monies paid out. Neither did he seek any assistance or advice on this matter.</p>

      <b>[30]</b> The Enactment contains specific provisions regarding the defendant's duties and responsibilities as the plaintiff 's General Manager and as its officer. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;12.;;">Section 12 of the Enactment</LINK> states, amongst others, that as General Manager he was bound to carry out the decisions of the plaintiff and the direction of the plaintiff 's Chairman. The defendant's lack of action and disregard for the plaintiff 's instructions to recover the monies, and his failure to seek assistance or advice on this matter although he had ample time to do so, are inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;12.;;">s 12 of the Enactment</LINK> and also <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_JHOR_1976_001;13A.;;">s 13A</LINK> (inserted vide Enactment No 11 of 1993) which specifically states <i>inter alia</i> that an officer or servant of the plaintiff shall not cause detriment to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> With respect to the withdrawals made by Megamerge after the defendant's resignation as the plaintiff 's General Manager, the defendant merely denied knowledge of these withdrawals although he agreed that he was one of the two co-signatories of cheques issued by Megamerge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> It is pertinent to note that, although on 22 August 2005 the defendant had ceased to be the General Manager and Director of the plaintiff, and had gone on mandatory retirement on 23 August 2005, he remained as a Director of Megamerge until 21 February 2006 when he resigned from the board of Megamerge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We take note that ordinarily no cheque from Megamerge would be honoured by the bank unless the cheque carried the required two signatures. PW1 had testified that the plaintiff did not appoint any replacement for the defendant in Megamerge. Thus the only reasonable and plausible explanation for the successful withdrawals made by Megamerge was that the cheques were signed by the two signatories, one of whom would have to be the defendant. These withdrawals occurred despite the defendant knowing that the monies were paid out to Megamerge without the plaintiff 's authorisation and that the plaintiff had wanted him to take action for the monies to be returned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> On the totality of the evidence we agree with the plaintiff that the defendant had acted negligently and had breached his fiduciary duties to the plaintiff. Therefore this action is properly instituted against the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> For the reasons stated above, we find no merit in the defendant's appeal. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs of RM2,000.00 and the deposit was ordered to be refunded. We affirmed the order made by the High Court.</p>
