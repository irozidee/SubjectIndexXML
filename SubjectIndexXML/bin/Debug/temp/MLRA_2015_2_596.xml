    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent was dismissed from the Royal Malaysian Police Force after the Disciplinary Board ("DB") found him guilty of soliciting bribe money from the complainant and for not making a report on the arrest of the complainant ("the charges"), who was suspected of driving a stolen car ("the vehicle"). Consequently, the respondent filed an application for judicial review in the High Court seeking to quash the decision of the DB. The respondent averred that he could not have committed the alleged misconduct as the vehicle was not reported stolen. After leave was granted by the High Court, the respondent filed an application for the discovery of certain documents ("the documents"). The trial judge, relying on the decision of <i>Ranhill Worley Sdn Bhd v. Franz Jozef Marie Schefman &amp; Anor ("Ranhill Worley")</i>, amongst others, allowed the application for discovery of the documents. Dissatisfied, the appellants filed this appeal, submitting, <i>inter alia</i>, that the documents were not relevant to the judicial review proceedings and that the case of Ranhill Worley was distinguishable from the instant case. Accordingly, the main issue to be decided was whether the documents were relevant to the judicial review proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (appeal allowed with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The fact that the vehicle was a stolen vehicle was not the foundation of the charges. It was raised as a defence by the respondent. Whether or not the vehicle was a stolen vehicle did not affect the charges or the respondent's defence. It was not the respondent's case that he did not arrest the complainant on the ground the vehicle was not a stolen vehicle or that he did in fact make a report on the arrest of the complainant. Furthermore, the appellants did not at any time aver that the vehicle was in fact stolen. (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The reliance by the trial judge on the case of Ranhill Worley was misplaced. The said case made reference to the case of <i>Rohana Ariffin v. Universiti Sains Malaysia &amp; Another Case</i>, which concerned the right for discovery of documents in disciplinary proceedings. In the instant case, the respondent did not request for the documents in the proceedings before the DB. The request was made after the DB had made its decision. Hence, there was no issue that the documents were crucial and necessary for the purpose of preparing the respondent's defence and representation. At the hearing before the DB, the respondent had put up his representation and had alluded to the fact that he had made enquires where he was informed that there was no report of the said vehicle being stolen. Accordingly, the appellants could not be said to have breached the procedural fairness requirement. In any event, a judicial review application was not concerned with the correctness of a decision but rather with the manner the decision was made. Hence, the categories of documents which a court could consider were necessary to be discovered would be much more confined than if the litigation was related to the merits of the case. (paras 16-17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Although the documents were referred to in the appellants' affidavit in reply, this was not a valid ground for discovery as it was not the assertion of the respondent that there was a conflicting version in the affidavit in reply of the appellants such that the documents were necessary to resolve the conflict. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant appeal, the respondent did not meet the requirements as stipulated in the cases of <i>Yekambaran Marimuthu v. Malayawata Steel Berhad</i>, <i>Rekapacific Bhd v. Securities Commission &amp; Anor &amp; Other Appeals</i> and Carlow Kilkenny Radio Ltd v. Broadcasting Commission, and failed to show the relevance of the documents for the purpose of the judicial review application. The respondent was given the opportunity to answer the charges and he was able to make his representation on the charges. Indeed it was not the contention of the respondent that he was not able to properly prepare his representation or his defence to the charges. (para 20)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The respondent was dismissed from the Royal Malaysian Police Force after the Disciplinary Board found him guilty of two charges. The first charge reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And the second charge reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent in his representation letter denied both charges. He stated <i>inter alia</i> that he had checked with the police internal database which confirmed that there was no report that the Mercedes Benz WHM 8123 (the vehicle) was stolen. The respondent contended that the disciplinary charges against him were baseless.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondent filed an application for judicial review in the High Court at Kuala Lumpur seeking for declaration and/or certiorari to quash the decision of the Disciplinary Board. In his affidavit in support of the application for judicial review, the respondent averred that he could not have committed the alleged misconduct as explained in his representation letter as the vehicle was not reported stolen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> After leave was granted by the High Court for the judicial review application, the respondent filed an application for the discovery of the following documents:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The application is supported by the following broad grounds (Rekod Rayuan Jld 1 Bhg A &amp; B: pp 31-33):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The application was allowed by the learned High Court Judge. Her Ladyship having considered <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order53.;;">O 53 of Rules of Court 2012 ('ROC')</LINK>, stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the learned judge, the appellants filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Before us, learned Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) for the appellants submitted that the documents are not relevant to the judicial review proceedings and that the case of <i>Ranhill Worley (supra)</i>, relied upon by the learned judge is distinguishable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Relying on <i>inter alia</i>, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_4_380;"><i>Yekambaran Marimuthu v. Malayawata Steel Berhad</i> [1993] 4 MLRH 380</LINK>; [1994] 2 CLJ 581, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the documents that were ordered by the High Court met the criteria set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order24;SN3.;;">O 24 r 3</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order24;SN7.;;">r 7 of the ROC 2012</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The alleged fact that this vehicle was a stolen vehicle, submitted learned counsel, formed the subject matter of the charges to which the respondent had unequivocally denied. It was the submission of learned counsel for the respondent that the appellants relied upon this fact in the decision making process. Thus it is necessary for him to have sight of the documents in order to advance his case in the judicial review application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The principles governing discovery in a judicial review application is clearly stated by this court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_571;"><i>Rekapacific Bhd v. Securities Commission &amp; Anor &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 571</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 269; [2005] 2 CLJ 108; [2005] 2 AMR 489 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In <i>Yekambaran Marimuthu (supra)</i>, Edgar Joseph Jr J said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We find that there is only one issue to be determined in this appeal, namely whether the respondent has satisfied that the documents sought for are relevant to the judicial review proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the documents are important to the respondent's case because the alleged fact that the vehicle was a stolen vehicle formed the subject matter of the charges. With respect, we are not able to agree with learned counsel. The disciplinary charges against the respondent were for soliciting the bribe money and for not making a report on the arrest of the complainant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The fact that the vehicle was a stolen vehicle was not the foundation of the charges. It was raised as a defence by the respondent. The respondent contended that he could not have committed the offence of soliciting the bribe when the vehicle was not reported stolen in the first place. In our view, whether or not the vehicle was a stolen vehicle would not affect the charges or the defence as it is not the respondent's case that he did not arrest the  complainant on the ground the vehicle was not a stolen vehicle or that he did in fact make a report on the arrest of the complainant. The respondent's position all along was that the vehicle was never reported stolen. He wanted the documents to confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. We do not find any dispute on this fact. The appellants did not at any time aver that the vehicle was in fact stolen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We agree with learned SFC that the case of <i>Ranhill Worley Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> is different on the facts. <i>Ranhill Worley</i> made reference to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1986_2_43;"><i>Rohana Ariffin v. Universiti Sains Malaysia &amp; Another Case</i> [1986] 2 MLRH 43</LINK>; [1988] 2 MLJ 609; [1988] 2 CLJ 390. <i>Rohana Ariffin</i> concerns the right for discovery of the documents in the disciplinary proceedings. In the instant case, the respondent did not request for the documents in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Board. The request was made after the Disciplinary Board had made its decision. There was thus no issue that the documents were crucial and necessary for the purpose of preparing the defence and representation. At the hearing before the Disciplinary Board, the respondent had put up his representation and he had alluded to the fact that he had made enquires where he was informed that there was no report of the said vehicle being stolen. The appellants could not be said to have breached the procedural fairness requirement. The reliance by the learned trial judge on the case of <i>Ranhill Worley</i> is with respect, misplaced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In any event, the judicial review application is not concerned with the correctness of a decision but rather with the manner the decision was made. Hence, the categories of documents which a court could consider were necessary to be discovered would be much more confined than if the litigation was related to the merits of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In <i>Carlow Kilkenny Radio Ltd v. Broadcasting Commission</i> [2003] 3 IR 528 at p 537, Geoghegan J said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The other reason advanced by the respondent for the documents was because the documents were referred to in the appellants' affidavit in reply. This, in our view is not a valid ground for discovery as it was not the assertion of the respondent that there was a conflicting version in the affidavit in reply of the appellants such that the documents are necessary to resolve the conflict.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> To conclude, we find that the respondent has not met the requirements as stipulated in the cases of <i>Yekambaran Marimuthu (supra)</i>; <i>Rekapacific Bhd (supra)</i> and <i>Carlow Kilkenny (supra)</i>. The respondent has failed to show the relevance of the documents for the purpose of the judicial review application. As mentioned above, he was given the opportunity to answer the charges and he was able to make his representation on the charges. Indeed it was not the contention of the respondent that he was not able to properly prepare his representation or his defence to the charges. We therefore allow the appeal with costs in the cause.</p>
