    <p>The appellant/plaintiff - a well-known politician - sued the respondent/ defendant for defamation, alleging that the defendant as a blogger had published or circulated a defamatory article on his (the defendant's) blog. The High Court found that the article was defamatory and did refer to the plaintiff, but held that the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant owned the blog or wrote the impugned blog post or article. The High Court dismissed the defamation suit and the plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal. In the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff complained <i>inter alia</i>, of the following issues: (i) the trial judge had marked the plaintiff's documentary evidence as exhibits with no objection from the defendant, but had subsequently refused to consider the marked exhibits on the ground of hearsay; (ii) the trial judge had failed to consider that the defendant's defence was a mere denial; and (iii) the trial judge had failed to properly consider or apply <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A of the Evidence Act 1950 ("the Act")</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the plaintiff's appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> As a general rule in a defamation suit relating to libel, once the plaintiff has established by direct or circumstantial evidence through documents: (i) that the article complained is defamatory; (ii) was published; (iii) refers to the plaintiff; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_2_493;"><i>YB Dato' Haji Husam Hj Musa v. Mohd Faisal Rohban Ahmad</i> [2015] 2 MLRA 493</LINK> and (iv) the defendant is the author of the misconduct, liability is attached. In such a case, the defendant's defence cannot survive on mere denial. When it relates to cyber crime, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A of the Act</LINK> will assist the plaintiff to force the defendant to exonerate himself from liability. (para 4)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In civil cases, once the court decides that the evidence is relevant and has allowed the evidence to be marked as exhibits with no objection by the respondent, it cannot be subsequently expunged on the ground that it has failed the admissibility test unless it has been marked as ID only for purposes to determine admissibility. (para 10)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> If the relevancy and/or admissibility of the evidence has been challenged throughout the trial, the court may deal with the issue at the end of the trial marking the evidence first as ID and subsequently as an exhibit. There is no discretion vested in the trial court to exclude relevant and admissible evidence marked as an exhibit and/or ID or whatever label it may have been given, especially when there is no objection taken by the parties when the exhibit or ID is marked. However, in criminal cases, the court has wide discretion to exclude relevant and admissible evidence under the fairness rule. (para 11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The trial judge cannot accept evidence as relevant, admit it, mark it as an exhibit and subsequently refuse to consider the evidence due to a lack of satisfaction on the admissibility procedure employed by the appellant. Once the evidence is marked as an exhibit, the court may give it low probative value but cannot exclude it. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant case, the trial judge's rejection of exh P2 and failure to take into consideration the relevant exhibits was bad in law and must be seen as perverse. Invoking <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Act</LINK> in not calling the maker of exh P2 was bad in law when the document had already been tendered and marked as an exhibit. Once it was marked as an exhibit, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g)</LINK> would not be applicable at all. Invoking <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A of the Act</LINK> after the exh P2 had been marked was also bad in law. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A</LINK> should have been applied before it was marked as an exhibit. Having it marked and excluding it in evidence would lead to a perverse judgment. (para 24 (a)-(c))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The rejection of SP3's evidence on the face of the record was perverse. In the instant case, SP3's evidence, exh P8 and the article exh P6 had nexus to link the blogger and his father. The court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114 of Act</LINK> was obliged to consider the evidence of SP2, SP3 and the exhibits, in particular exh 8 and exh P2, in totality. (para 24 (d)-(e))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> On the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff had made out a case against the defendant. The defendant in the instant case had also failed to rebut the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A of Act</LINK> and the defence of mere denial was not acceptable on the facts of the case as identity had been established on the balance of probabilities; and in defamation suits it need not be beyond reasonable doubt. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The trial judge had misdirected himself and had not directed his mind to the relevant issues. He had not acted in accordance with the law and the decision did not pass the acid test of reasonableness. (para 27)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge dismissing the defamation suit (on liability) came up for hearing on 5 March 2014 and upon hearing we allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and remitted the case for assessment of damages before the High Court. My learned brothers Azahar Mohamed JCA and Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The Memorandum of Appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminaries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The central issue and complaint of the appellant in this case in essence is that (i) the learned judge had marked the plaintiff 's documentary evidence as exhibit with no objection from the defendant and subsequently in the judgment resiled from the position and refused to consider some of the marked exhibits on the grounds of hearsay without giving any notice or opportunity to the plaintiff, thereby committing error of law as well as misdirection on the law which has resulted in procedural unfairness of grave nature which has prejudiced the plaintiff 's case and lead to an erroneous conclusion; (ii) the learned judge failed to consider that the defendant's defence was a mere denial and no particulars were given in the statement of defence to support his defence of denial, more so when the defendant was not relying on the statutory defence and/or common law defence, and the new provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A of the Evidence Act 1950 (EA 1950)</LINK> assists the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As a general rule in defamation suit relating to libel, once the plaintiff has established by direct and/or circumstantial evidence through documents that the act complained is defamatory, and was published, and it refers to the plaintiff, and the defendant was the author of the misconduct, liability is attached, and the defendant's defence cannot survive on mere denial, and when it relates to cyber crime, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A EA 1950</LINK> will assist the plaintiff to force the defendant to exonerate himself from liability.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We do not wish to dwell on the statutory and common law defences of defamation as it has been well articulated by Hamid Sultan JC in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2008_2_360;"><i>Chew Peng Cheng v. Anthony Teo Tiao Gin</i> [2008] 2 MLRH 360</LINK>; [2008] 5 MLJ 577, as the instant case relates to a mere denial where no statutory or common law defence has been raised. This case is also not concerned whether the plaintiff has proved the element of defamation but whether it was correct in law to accept the plaintiff 's evidence and exhibits at the stage of plaintiff 's case with the consent of the defendant and subsequently reject without giving notice to the plaintiff, some of the exhibits which is the foundation and/or has nexus to the plaintiff 's case and is a relevant evidence pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;5.;;">s 5 of the EA 1950</LINK>, which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It must be noted that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">EA 1950</LINK> is in essence a departure to a large extent of exclusionary rules at common law and it takes an inclusive approach discarding the common law rules of hearsay, etc; and giving wide powers to court to admit evidence and/or document if it is relevant and not because it offends any exclusionary rules with a small opening (in practice) in civil cases and rules of procedure by the agreement of parties to allow whatever documents the parties have agreed to be relevant to the subject matter of the suit. It is a cardinal rule of evidence at common law that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The cardinal rule of the common law has been excluded or whittled down not only by the original <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK> but also through a list of amendments after independence to reach a fair and balanced result and to meet with modern challenges in civil and criminal litigation to attain justice. [See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;73AA.;;">s 73AA</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A of EA 1950</LINK>].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It must also be noted that rules of evidence is not only dependant on the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">EA 1950</LINK> but also other Act or rules and the application of this principle is often cross checked by the courts by looking at the common law principles and cases to ensure and to achieve a fair result. When the Act is silent on its applicability, etc; the court's role is captured in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;136.;;">s 136 of EA 1950</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Parliament has entrusted the court the role of deciding what is relevant and the discretion for the court to allow the relevant evidence to be admissible. Just because the evidence is relevant does not mean it is admissible as of right. It is usually the case but not necessarily. The jurisprudence is captured in <i>Janab's Key to the Law of Evidence</i> (2014) at pp 224 and 226 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Even though relevancy is one of law it is no easy task for trial court to rule on the subject on hotly contested facts as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;5.;;">s 5</LINK> places the task on the courts to deal with various concepts (as well as difficult concepts) like res gestae, hearsay evidence, dying declaration, admission, confession, opinion evidence, character evidence, similar fact, evidence, etc. It has to be taken by at least a three step approach. First stage, the court must prima facie consider whether the fact is relevant. This is more of a common sense approach taken by any person with the most basic legal qualification. The second stage is whether by saying it as relevant, related provisions of the Act are infringed; or to put it in another way whether the person introducing the fact has satisfied the criteria of the Act. If he does not satisfy the criteria that evidence is not relevant. Once this two stage procedure has been satisfactorily dealt with, then the third stage is the admissibility stage which is procedural in nature. Here the court has to look at whether the litigant has satisfied the rules of admissibility. If the litigant has not, the relevant evidence can be rejected, for example, not producing the original document or satisfying the criteria for introducing secondary evidence. In civil cases, once the court decides that the evidence is relevant and have allowed the exhibits to be marked as exhibit with no objection by the respondent, it cannot be subsequently expunged on the ground that it has failed the admissibility test unless it has been marked as ID only for purpose to determine admissibility.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> However, if the relevancy and/or admissibility has been challenged throughout the trial, the court may deal with the issue at the end of the trial marking it first as ID and subsequently as exhibit. There is no discretion vested in the trial court to exclude relevant and admissible evidence marked as exhibit and/or ID or whatever label it may have been given, that too when there was no objection taken by the parties when the exhibit or ID is marked. This is not the position in criminal cases. In criminal cases, the court has wide discretion to exclude relevant and admissible evidence under the fairness rule. This jurisprudence has been captured in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_295;"><i>Liang Weng Heng v. PP</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 295</LINK>; [2014] 2 MLJ 855, where the quorum consisted of Azahar Mohamed, Mohtarudin Baki and Hamid Sultan Abu Backer, and we do not wish to repeat the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In the instant case, the complaint of the appellant is that the learned judge had accepted the evidence as relevant and admitted it and marked as exhibit and subsequently in the judgment refused to consider the evidence, in consequence of lack of satisfaction on the admissibility procedure employed by the appellant. That the learned trial judge cannot do. Once it is marked as exhibit, the court in deliberating that fact can give low probative value but cannot exclude it. The only court which in civil case can consider the evidence or accept a document as an exhibit in a limited sense is the appellate court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;167.;;">s 167 of EA 1950</LINK> or if it is Court of Appeal also pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;69.;;">s 69 Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;69.;;">s 69 Courts of Judicature Act(CJA) 1964</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is also a must in the event the exhibit is marked as ID only or if the evidence is by way of statement or oral evidence, it must form part of the Appeal Record as of right as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;167.;;">s 167 of EA 1950</LINK> as well as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;69.;;">s 69 CJA 1964</LINK> makes it mandatory for the appellate court to revisit the issue if necessary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The plaintiff is a well known PAS politician. The defamation suit alleges that the defendant is a blogger and circulated an article titled "Husam Dan Tamrin Balun Balak 15 Juta" via blogspot 'ruangbicarafaisal.blogspot.com' on 3 October 2009. The defendant denies writing the article and owning the said blogspot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned trial judge had found the article to be defamatory and it referred to the plaintiff but says the plaintiff did not establish that defendant is the writer in the blog without considering <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A of the EA 1950</LINK>. The relevant finding of the learned judge as to the issue of liability reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In the instant case, three witnesses including the plaintiff gave evidence for the plaintiff and two for the defendant. The evidence of the plaintiff's second and third witnesses (SP2 and SP3) evidence and some of the documents tendered through them did not find favour with the learned judge. These two witness's evidence and documents tendered were crucial to establish the culpability of the defendant. The learned trial judge preferred to accept the bare denial defence and evidence of the defendant (SD1) story as well as his witness SD2 who purportedly gave evidence on a subject matter of documents when both parties have agreed to be marked as exhibits. SD2 evidence in the instant case may have been relevant if the documents which SD2 attempted to discredit was at ID stage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In addition, the appellant complains that the learned judge has failed to consider or reject the appellant's evidence to show nexus to the defendant, which after much deliberation, we find has merits. That part of the submission of the appellant reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> SP2 was a process server and through him the exh 'P2", 'P3 to P3AM' exh 'P4' were marked. His evidence and documents without objection from the defendant links the defendant. SP3 was a doctor who links the defendant by virtue of treating his father in the hospital and through him exh 'P3' was marked. Again there was no objection and no request was made to mark the documents as ID by the defendant. All the said exhibits and the evidence of SP2 in actual fact stands as strong circumstantial evidence against the defendant and the 'phone sms' gives added probative force to the plaintiff 's claim. The learned trial judge on this issue relating to SP2 and SP3 evidence stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Exhibit P6 has much relevance to this case and the evidence of SP3 and the learned trial judge has captured that part of the evidence as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The learned trial judge has also documented the defendant's case as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The learned trial judge in saying that the plaintiff had not proved that the defendant is the blogger says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The learned trial judge also relies on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) EA 1950</LINK> for not calling the maker of exh P2 and also says <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;90A.;;">s 90A EA 1950</LINK> requirement was not satisfied. In addition, the learned trial judge says that the plaintiff failed to satisfy that the defendant was the person who wrote on the blog, and refused to accept the photograph exhs as P3 as well as P4.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The appellant also complains that the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A EA 1950</LINK> was not considered by the learned judge. On this point, the learned counsel for the appellant says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We have read the appeal record, the submission of the parties in detail. After much consideration to the submission of the respondent, we take the view that there are serious errors of law and misdirection on the face of record and the judgment per se is perverse and ought to be set aside, and judgment on liability be entered in favour of the plaintiff with an order for assessment before the High Court. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> There was failure of proper judicial appreciation on the above issues related to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">114 EA 1950</LINK> making the judgment perverse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We have gone through the evidence repeatedly and we are satisfied that on the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff has made out a case against the defendant. The defendant in this case has also failed to rebut the presumption under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114A.;;">s 114A EA 1950</LINK> and the defence of mere denial is not acceptable on the facts of the case as identity has been established on the balance of probabilities; and in defamation suits it need not be on beyond reasonable doubt. Such a proposition is also consistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(h) of EA 1950</LINK> which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
