    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the committal order made against him by the High Court for publication of a defamatory article against the respondent titled "Kes Saman Utusan: Mahkamah Malaysia Bodoh Jika Anwar Menang" on a website address of www.pribumiperkasa.com. Contempt proceedings were instituted against the appellant as the second contemnor in the High Court on the basis that he was the President of an organisation known as "Pertubuhan Pribumi Perkasa Malaysia" ('PERKASA') and that the website concerned was the official website of PERKASA. The appellant contended that the article was solely authored by the first contemnor, who was held liable by the High Court, and that the website was registered in the first contemnor's name. Also, the website concerned was not the official website of PERKASA as PERKASA's official website at the material time was http://pribumiperkasa.org/. The appellant also denied that he was responsible in any way for the contents of the article. Against this, the respondent argued that even if the appellant was not the author or directly involved in the publication of the article, the appellant was liable for contempt by omission. It was also argued that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_335;51.;;">s 51(1) and (2) of the Societies Act 1966</LINK> was wide enough to include within its scope the contempt allegedly committed herein and it applied to the appellant in his position as President of PERKASA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The article was outrightly contemptuous of the court in that while the decision in the main suit was still pending (sub judice) it challenged and imputed that the court would be "stupid" to allow the respondent's claim as plaintiff in the defamation action. It scandalised the court by stating that the Malaysian judiciary had been biased in favour of opposition figures (like the respondent) in their judgments of late. The obvious intention behind the article was to exert pressure on the trial judge to decide against the respondent. It went on to make opprobrious personal attacks on the trial judge. As a whole, the article cast serious aspersions on the integrity and impartiality of the courts in the administration of justice that was clearly calculated to lower the standing of the courts in the eyes of the public. The writer and any others linked to the article deserved the strongest condemnation and sanctions in order that the dignity of the courts was not so flippantly or callously tarnished. (paras 20-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The exhibits referred to by the trial judge showed no cause for any doubt that the website www.pribumiperkasa.com was effectively the mouthpiece of PERKASA, notwithstanding that it was registered and operated by the first contemnor. The appellant himself admitted that www.pribumiperkasa.org was not maintained and no longer in use. The appellant's attempt to distance PERKASA from the offending material on account that PERKASA had another official website www.pribumiperkasa.org was shallow and a feeble stance. Similarly, the contention that the trial judge failed to appreciate that there was a difference between the two websites could not be accepted and was devoid of any merit. (paras 32-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The article had been removed from the website within three days of it being first loaded on to the website. The material part of the trial judge's finding implicating the appellant was that he knew or ought to have known of its contemptuous contents and flowing from that he had committed contempt by omission (in not disowning, disavowing or distancing himself). The trial judge was in fact postulating that a mere passive role or silence by the appellant could amount to contempt of court. That was not a sound principle of law (even if valid) to be applied in the factual circumstances of the case. It would have been another matter if it was shown on evidence that the appellant did in fact have actual or real knowledge of, sanctioned the publication of the article on the website in question or that he subsequently became aware of such publication but did not do anything to remove the same. (paras 39-41)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The appellant had maintained at all material times that he had no knowledge whatsoever of the article concerned. That fact was not challenged or rebutted by the respondent. Hence, the issue that the appellant failed to "disown, disavow or distance himself" from the article, did not arise and could not rightfully form the basis for contempt by omission. In the circumstances, there was no necessity to decide whether the term "any offence punishable with a fine or imprisonment has been committed" in the opening lines of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_335;51.;;">s 51(1) of the Societies Act 1966</LINK> was limited to offences made punishable under that legislation only or did extend to include other "offences" recognised within the wider purview of the law or even contempt of court proceedings. Even if the appellant was caught within that section as the President of PERKASA, he could avail himself of the defence expressly provided to displace that deeming provision, namely, this court was satisfied that the article was published without the appellant's actual knowledge and he had no control as to the commission of the offence.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The principal suit was a defamation action brought by the plaintiff against a newspaper and another. This suit had been tried before VT Singham J and the court had fixed the 21 March 2013 for delivery of decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 7 January 2013 an article entitled "Kes Saman Utusan: Mahkamah Malaysia Bodoh Jika Anwar Menang" was found published on the website with the URL address of "http:www.pribumiperkasa.com/" (the article).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiff commenced proceedings against:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>to commit them for contempt of court with regard to the publication of the article.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> John Louis O'Hara J at the High Court on 19 November 2013 held that both Zainuddin bin Salleh (first contemnor) and Ibrahim bin Ali (second contemnor) were guilty of contempt of court. His Lordship proceeded to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> This appeal before us was the appeal of the second contemnor against both the finding of contempt and the sentence imposed by the court against him. (The first contemnor had also lodged an appeal against committal order made against him on 13 November 2013 but has since withdrawn his appeal.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Second Contemnor's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It was contended that the article had been admitted to be authored solely by the first contemnor. It was first posted as a blog on www.ob21.net (at 8.48pm on 7 January 2013), which was a website registered in the name of the first contemnor, who also referred to himself as 'Zainuddin@obey_one'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> According to the first contemnor, the article had also been/downloaded into the following websites on the same day:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The first contemnor had also on affidavit stated that www.ob21.net and www.pribumiperkasa.com were both registered in his name and the latter (www.pribumiperkasa.com) was not the official website nor was it owned by the organisation known as "Pertubuhan Pribumi Perkasa Malaysia" (PERKASA).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> It was also highlighted to us that although the second contemnor had admitted on affidavit that he was the President of PERKASA and that the first contemnor was a member of PERKASA, the second contemnor had nevertheless categorically denied that the website www.pribumiperkasa.com was the official website of PERKASA, it was and remained always the personal website operated by the first contemnor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The second contemnor further denied that he was in any way responsible for the contents of material found on the first contemnor's website and that, in any event PERKASA's official website at the material time was http:// pribumiperkasa.org/ (which had been launched on 21 October 2008)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It need to be noted that the contempt proceedings had been instituted against the second contemnor on the basis that the second contemnor was the President of PERKASA and that the article had been found on the 'official website' of PERKASA.</p>
    <p>It was submitted that the learned judge had disregarded the denial and the several averments of both the first and second contemnors, and had clearly omitted to give due consideration to the fact that PERKASA's official website in any event was another namely - http://pribumiperkasa.org/.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In the circumstances, it was argued that the learned judge was clearly in error or had misdirected himself when it was ruled by the court as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was urged upon us that there was no evidence to show that the second contemnor had been consulted or had been made aware of the article written by the first contemnor. The only link relied upon by the plaintiff to implicate the second contemnor was the website http:www.pribumiperkasa.com and the wrongful acceptance by the learned judge that this was the 'official website' of PERKASA. Such a connection had been disproved by the contents of the affidavits filed by the first and second contemnors, which, it was submitted, had not been rebutted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The burden was, it was further stressed, upon the plaintiff to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the second contemnor had personally known or conspired to commit the contemptuous act or that the publication or circulation of the article was within the second contemnor's control (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1999_3_1;"><i>Asia Pacific Parcel Tankers Pte Ltd v. The Owners Of The Ship Or Vessel "Normar Splendour"</i> [1999] 3 MLRH 1</LINK>; [1999] 6 MLJ 652; [1999] 7 CLJ 213; [1999] 4 AMR 4835). This, it was contended had not been discharged in any event by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Plaintiff's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The plaintiff maintained that the article was published on PERKASA's 'main website'. It was argued that the contents of the article was written and published to bring the court and a judge into contempt and to ridicule the judicial authority generally. In other words it was intended to obstruct or interfere with the administration or the course of justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was submitted that even an 'omission' to take steps to remove or prevent further publication knowing that the article was scurrilous and contemptuous, could rightfully form the foundation of an action in contempt against second contemnor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Counsel for plaintiff also referred to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_335;51.;;">s 51(1)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_ACTS_1987_335;51.;;">s 51(2) of the Societies Act 1966</LINK> and contended that those provisions were not limited to an offence under that Act but was wide enough ("... any offence ...") to deem the second contemnor, as the person managing or assisting in the management of a society, (in this case PERKASA) was liable for 'contempt' which was punishable in terms similar to a criminal offence. In any event, it was submitted that the second contemnor had not exercised "all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence" and it was also alleged that the second contemnor had failed to take any steps to remove or discontinue the publication; the article had attracted wide public attention in the meanwhile.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was urged upon us that since the learned judge had made a 'finding of fact', namely, that the second contemnor had 'constructive knowledge', the issue of whether there was any 'intention' or not was no longer relevant; it would only have a bearing when considering the sentence to be meted out for the contempt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Finally, it was submitted for the plaintiff, that the punishment of both, custodial sentence (one day) and fine was appropriate in this case considering the seriousness of the contempt scandalising the court and the unwarranted scurrilous personal attack mounted against the trial judge; there was no valid reason to interfere with that sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Observations And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We must at the outset register our concurrence with the finding of the learned judge who heard this committal proceedings that the blog written by the first contemnor titled 'Kes Saman Utusan: Mahkamah Bodoh Jika Anwar Menang' (some 21 paragraphs) in www.ob21.net was outright contemptuous of the court in that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Considering the gravity of the contempt, we were mindful that, primarily the writer, and also any others properly shown to be linked to that material that had been published, deserved the strongest condemnation and sanctions in order that the dignity of the court was not so flippantly or callously tarnished.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We need however at this point make note of two particular matters. Firstly, only the first five paragraphs of the whole blog were republished in www.pribumiperkasa.com. Nevertheless within it (the article) was included a footer as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Secondly, this contempt proceedings against the 2nd Ccontemnor was premised upon the allegations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Having considered the submission of respective counsel (including the Bar Council as<i>amicus curiae</i>) and having reviewed the various documents in the Appeal Record, we were of the view that there was only two questions that had to be dealt with in this appeal.</p>
    <p>These two questions were distinct from one and another and had to be addressed separately; any tendency towards confusing the two questions ought to be carefully and consciously avoided by us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The two questions were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It should also be stated here that the correctness of the learned judge's further finding that the second contemnor failed to disown, disavow or distance himself from the article and thereby had "... committed contempt by omission" would invariably depend on the determination of the second question as identified above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We were mindful that allegations of contempt against the court or a judge (<i>R v. Grey</i> [1900] 2 QBD 36, with respect to a personal attack on a judge) was a serious matter and committal proceeding itself was criminal in nature. In <i>Re: Bramblevale Ltd</i> [1970] 1 Ch 125, Lord Denning MR had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1990_1_570;"><i>Attorney-General v. Manjeet Singh Dhillon</i> [1990] 1 MLRA 570</LINK>; [1991] 1 MLJ 167; [1991] 1 CLJ 22, the court ruled:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_717;"><i>Tan Sri Dato' Dr Rozali Ismail &amp; Ors v. Lim Pang Cheong &amp; Ors</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 717</LINK>; [2012] 3 MLJ 458; [2012] 2 CLJ 849; [2012] 2 AMR 429 reaffirmed that it is settled law that since committal proceeding involve the liberty of an alleged contemnor, be it civil or criminal contempt, the standard of proof required was proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It has also be held that should any doubt arise as to the culpability of the alleged contemnor, it ought to be resolved in favour of the alleged contemnor. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1806;"><i>AV Asia Sdn Bhd v. Measat Broadcast Network Systems Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor (Encls 53 &amp; 54)</i> [2012] MLRHU 1806</LINK> and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_260;"><i>Wee Choo Keong v. MBF Holdings Bhd &amp; Anor And Another Appeal</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 260</LINK>; [1993] 2 MLJ 217; [1993] 3 CLJ 210; [1993] 2 AMR 1205).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Returning then to the first question above, both the contemnors, it must be noted, have denied that www.pribumiperkasa.com (where the impugned article was published) was ever the official website of PERKASA. The second contemnor asserted that the official website of PERKASA was www. pribumiperkasa.org.</p>
    <p>However the second contemnor in the Affidavit In Reply affirmed by him on 4 April 2013 at para 5.3 and 5.4 states as follows (in the translation in English)</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The learned judge in his grounds of decision at para 19, had found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We have examined the exhibits referred to by the learned Judge (introduced by an affidavit filed for the Bar Council). There was no cause for any doubt in our mind that the website www.pribumiperkasa.com was effectively the mouthpiece of PERKASA, notwithstanding that it was registered and operated by the first contemnor. The second contemnor himself admitted that ww.pribumiperkasa.org was not maintained and no longer in use.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Exhibit 'WTS-2' clearly was an acknowledgment by the first contemnor that the contents of www.pribumiperkasa.com were monitored by responsible office-bearers of PERKASA. Exhibit 'WTS-3' sought to assert copyright of materials to PERKASA and exhs 'WTS-5' to 'WTS-10' were website of PERKASA's individual State Units and they were all linked to this website www.pribumiperkasa.com.</p>
    <p>It was also not in dispute that one Media Perkasa Sdn Bhd had also used www. pribumiperkasa.com to recruit new members for PERKASA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In our assessment of all the relevant evidence on this score that was before the court on affidavit, the second contemnor's attempt to distance PERKASA from the offending material on account that PERKASA had another official website (www.pribumiperkasa.org) was indeed shallow and a feeble stance. Similarly, the contention of counsel for the second contemnor that the learned judge had failed to appreciate that there was a difference between the two websites could not be accepted and was devoid of any merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We then deal with the second question which we found to be the crucial one of the two, for a proper determination of this appeal before us.</p>
    <p>It was submitted to us that the impugned Article was available on the internet between 7 January 2013 and 10 January 2013, before it appeared to have been removed. The article had also been referred to in a report in the Free Malaysia Today online news portal on 8 January 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> It was contended that the second contemnor as President of PERKASA at the material time would have known or ought to have known of the notoriety or publicity generated by the said article. Counsel for the Bar Council argued that the second contemnor should in any event be imputed with constructive knowledge (knowledge that one using reasonable care or diligence should have, and therefore attributed by law to a given person - quoting Black's Law Dictionary).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Counsel for Bar Council also cited a passage from VG Ramanchandran's Contempt of Court (6th edn) in support of his contention and we reproduce the same here:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Counsel for both the plaintiff and the Bar Council made reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_335;51.;;">s 51(1) and s 51(2) of the Societies Act 1966</LINK> and argued that they were wide enough ('any offence') to include within its scope the contempt allegedly committed here and it applied to the second contemnor in his position as President of PERKASA. It was further submitted the second contemnor could not avail of the defences prescribed there, namely that, '... the offence was committed without his knowledge" and "... that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Counsel for the second contemnor on the other hand highlighted to us the following passage from the judgment in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2003_3_593;"><i>Stemlife Bhd v. Bristol Myers Squibb (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2009] 3 MLRH 593</LINK>; [2010] 3 CLJ 251 which made an important distinction as between material that was printed in media like the newspaper or book and those material found posted on a website.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This, to us, was a significant distinction which had to be borne in mind when determining whether the second contemnor had 'knowledge' or could be deemed to have knowledge or could be deemed liable for the Article found on www.pribumiperkasa.com on 7 January 2013. It was asserted that in any case, the article had been removed from the website by 10 January 2013, that is, within three days of its being first loaded on to the website.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> As pointed out earlier the material part of the learned judge's finding implicating the second contemnor was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What was in effect being postulated here by the learned judge was that a mere passive role or 'silence' by second contemnor could amount to 'contempt of court'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We however found it difficult to accept this as a sound principle of law (even if valid) to be applied in the factual circumstances obtaining in this case.</p>
    <p>It would have been another matter if it was shown on evidence that the appellant did in fact have actual or real knowledge of or sanctioned the publication of the impugned article on the website in question or even that, he subsequently became aware of such publication but did not do anything to remove the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We were referred by counsel for the Bar Council to <i>R v. Walter</i> 170 ER 524 and <i>Byrne v. Deane</i> [1937] 1 KB 818 to show that there could arise 'contempt by omission' notwithstanding that one was not the author or was directly involved in the publication of the offending material so long as positive steps were not taken to stop the publication or to remove the material.</p>
    <p>Both those cases, it must be noted related to proceedings in defamation (the former against proprietor of a newspaper in criminal defamation and the latter against proprietor of a club) and in reading those cases, it was clear to us that liability was determined as against them stemmed from the fact that they had direct knowledge of the defamatory material but recklessly 'published' it in Walter's case or in the latter (Byrne) took no action to remove the material from the club notice board; it was not per se because they held a responsible position in the newspaper or club respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> A case for 'contempt by omission' could no doubt arise if there was defiance to the terms of or wilful disregard to any order issued by the court to do or to restrain from doing some act. A person who had notice of such a court order (but was not a party to the proceedings itself) who defied the same could also be similarly held liable for contempt. This was the fact situation in <i>Grocon &amp; Ors v. Construction, Forestry, Ministry and Energy Union &amp; 2 Ors</i> [2014] VSC 134 and could not therefore be of assistance to what was being contended by counsel for the Bar Council.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The second contemnor has maintained in this instant case that at all material times he had no knowledge whatsoever of the article concerned; this fact was never challenged or rebutted by the respondent. Hence, with respect to the learned judge, the issue that the appellant failed to 'disown, disavow or distance himself ' from the article, did not arise and could not rightfully form the basis for the so called 'contempt by omission' held to have been committed by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the light of the above it was not necessary for us to decide whether the term 'any offence punishable with a fine or imprisonment has been committed' in the opening lines of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_335;51.;;">s 51(1) of the Societies Act, 1966</LINK> was limited to offences made punishable under that legislation only or did extend to include other 'offences' recognised within the wider purview of the law or even 'contempt of court' proceedings.</p>
    <p>In any event, even if the second contemnor was caught within that section as the President of PERKASA, we were of the view that he could avail himself of the defence expressly provided to displace that deeming provision, namely, this court has been satisfied, as shown above, that the impugned article was published without the second contemnor's actual knowledge and he had no control as to the so called 'commission' of the 'offence', if at all it occurred when it was uploaded onto the website www.pribumiperkasa.com.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> For the reasons elaborated and discussed above, we were of the view that the learned judge were clearly in error both on the facts and in law to hold that the appellant had committed contempt of court as alleged by the respondent. We therefore are of the unanimous view that this was a fit case for appellate intervention.</p>
    <p>The findings of the learned judge that the appellant had committed contempt of court was unsafe to be sustained. We accordingly set aside the punishments imposed by way of committal on the second contemnor/appellant. We order that the fine imposed, if paid, be refunded.</p>
