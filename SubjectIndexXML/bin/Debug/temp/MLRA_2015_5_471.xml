    <p>The respondent/plaintiff filed a defamation suit against the appellants/defendants arising from the publication of an article in the Malay daily, Utusan Melayu. The defendants had raised justification, qualified privilege and fair comment as part of their defence. In the relevant paragraphs of the statement of defence, they relied on the following facts in criminal cases involving the plaintiff to support their defence: (i) that the plaintiff's previous convictions of four charges for corrupt practices under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1970_073;2.;;">s 2(1) of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance 1970</LINK> and (ii) the remark in the majority judgment of the Federal Court in <i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> to the effect that there was evidence to show that the plaintiff was involved in homosexual activities. The plaintiff argued that the plea contained in the impugned paragraphs of the defendants' defence should not be allowed as it contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> ('Act') and ought to be struck out. The Judicial Commissioner ('JC') allowed the plaintiff's application to strike out the impugned paragraphs. The defendants appealed against the JC's decision to strike out paragraphs of the defence in respect of the defence of justification. The plaintiff appealed against the dismissal of his application to strike out the paragraphs of the defence relating to qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the defendants' appeals and allowing the plaintiff's appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Having read <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Act</LINK>, there was no ambiguity in the section that as a matter of evidence, a judgment, order or decree was irrelevant except where the existence of such judgment, order or decree was a fact in issue or that such judgment, order or decree was relevant under some other provisions of the Act. The only exception that made a judgment, order or decree relevant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> as a matter of evidence was where the judgment, order or decree was relevant for the purposes of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;40.;;">ss 40</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;41.;;">41</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;42.;;">42 of the Act</LINK>. However, none of those three sections was in issue in these appeals and therefore was not applicable; nor was the judgment in question a fact in issue. (para 11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The argument that the word 'judgment' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Act</LINK> ought to include opinions could not stand. No doubt a judgment of court consisted of opinion of the court as to the facts and evidence adduced before it. However, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> was very clear that the judgments, orders and decrees were irrelevant unless they could be brought within the 'exception' under the section. In this respect, if <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> prohibited a judgment to be brought in as evidence, <i>fortiori</i> reasons or opinions, which were <i>obiter</i> in the judgment, could not be brought in also as evidence. (paras 18-19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the face of the overwhelming authorities locally and from foreign jurisdictions in particular the UK (before the statutory intervention) and India, a judgment in a criminal case could not be used as proof of a fact in issue in a civil claim for damages. Therefore, with regards to the defendants' defence of justification, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Act</LINK> would be a bar to the defendants to rely on the judgment or order or decree of another court proceeding, more so if it was a criminal proceeding. (paras 23-24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> With regards to the defence of fair comment, the JC said that the defendants had the right to this defence of fair comment for the impugned statements were comments and expressions of opinion of the judgment commented upon. It appeared that the JC was adopting different tests when applying <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Act</LINK> - one test for the plea of justification and another for the plea of qualified privilege and fair comment. This was not a proper way to interpret and apply a statutory provision. There should be only one test; and that was whether the judgment relied on was relevant. Once it was decided that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> a judgment in another proceeding was not relevant to the civil proceeding at hand, then it was not relevant for all purposes unless it could be brought within the 'exception'. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In civil proceedings, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;52.;;">ss 52</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">55 of the Act</LINK> are the relevant provisions. Under these two provisions, conviction for a criminal offence is not relevant as evidence of bad character. Furthermore, the explanation to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">s 55</LINK> makes it very clear that only evidence of general reputation and general disposition are admissible to prove bad or good character. It cannot be proved by a particular act. In this regard, the JC had erred in concluding that the defendants were relying on general reputation and disposition. On the facts, the defendants by relying on the conviction of the plaintiff in the second sodomy case and the remark by the Federal Court as to the plaintiff's act of homosexual activities in the first sodomy case, were in fact relying on particular acts to show the general reputation and general disposition of the plaintiff. This was incorrect and not permissible by virtue of the explanation to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55;;">s 55</LINK>. (para 30)</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeals</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> There are three appeals before us:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>All the three appeals arose from the High Court decision given on 26 December 2012 in Kuala Lumpur Guaman Sivil No: 23 NCVC-42-03-2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Material Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The plaintiff had filed the defamation suit against all the three defendants arising from the publication of an article in a Malay daily Utusan Melayu, entitled "Anwar Bisexual, tak boleh jadi Ketua Pembangkang - Nalla" (the impugned article). The words in the impugned article are attributed to the 1st defendant. The 2nd defendant is the publisher of the Malay daily who published the impugned article. The 3rd defendant is the Editor of the Malay daily Utusan Melayu.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The 2nd and 3rd defendants had filed a joint defence. The 1st defendant filed his own separate defence. All the three defendants however have raised justification, qualified privilege and fair comment as part of their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In the relevant paragraphs of the statement of defence, all the three defendants relied on the following facts in criminal cases including the plaintiff to support their defences:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Plaintiff's/Respondent's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the plea contained in the impugned paragraphs of the defendants' defences should not be allowed as it contravened <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act</LINK> and ought to be struck out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings By High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner of the High Court Justice Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, after considering submission by counsel and the authorities cited to him concluded at para 27 of his judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned Judicial Commissioner also relied on <i>Anwar bin Ibrahim v. Khalid Jefri &amp; Anor</i> (Civil Appeal No: W-02741-2000) (unreported) where the Court of Appeal struck out a plea of the plaintiff's criminal conviction to found justification a defence in a libel case by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of Evidence Act 1950</LINK> and said that "... in as much as I may think that this area of the law may be ripe for reform, the doctrine of stare decisis would require me to follow that judicial precedent".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The next case considered by the learned Judicial Commissioner is the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_1;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. Dato' Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2001] 2 MLJ 65; [2000] 1 CLJ 663; [1999] 4 AMR 3926 - referred to by counsel for the defendants. The respondent in that case had relied on the conviction of two persons, one Dr Munawar Ahmad Anees (Munawar) and Sukma Dermawan Saasmitaat Madja (Sukma) on charges that they had allowed the applicant there (the plaintiff here) to sodomise them to support his defence of justification. The respondent/defendant in that case was successful before the High Court and Court of Appeal to have the suit against him struck off. The appellant then applied for leave to appeal to Federal Court on the question <i>inter alia</i> whether in a defamation action, the High Court can decide on the defence of justification and qualified privilege without a trial to dismiss the plaintiff's suit under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;18.;;">O 18 r 19 Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. The Federal Court answered the question in affirmative and said that the trial judge in that case had correctly addressed the issues of justification and qualified privilege on the facts admitted and the confession as to the acts of gross indecency in the criminal cases involving Munawar and Sukma. Counsel for the defendants in the present appeals submitted that the Federal Court case is the authority for the proposition that the findings in a criminal trial can be used as defence of justification in a civil action. The learned Judicial Commissioner however rejected this argument on the ground that the Federal Court in that case did not consider the effect of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of Evidence Act 1950</LINK> and moreover it was just an observation by the Federal Court made in the course of considering an application for leave to appeal. In the result, the learned Judicial Commissioner concluded at para 31 of his judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Defendants'/Appellants' Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In these three appeals before us, counsel for the appellants in Appeal Nos: 153 and 249 had urged this court to be inspired and to interpret <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> broadly and to move with the time by taking the development in UK, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore in this area of law into consideration. It was submitted that the law in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of Evidence Act 1950</LINK> is an embodiment of a common law rule laid down in the English case of <i>Hollington v. F Hewthorn &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1943] 2 All ER 35. This decision had been cited with approval by our courts. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_447;"><i>She Eng Gek v. DA De Silva</i> [1956] 1 MLRH 447</LINK>; [1957] 1 MLJ 55, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_96;"><i>Ong Tua Chor v. Lee Beng Tong</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 96</LINK>; [1976] 1 MLJ 187 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_1_509;"><i>YK Fung Securities Sdn Bhd v. James Capel (Far East) Ltd</i> [1997] 1 MLRA 509</LINK>; [1997] 2 MLJ 621 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_2_360;"><i>DP Vijandran v. Karpal Singh &amp; Ors</i> [2000] 2 MLRH 360</LINK>; [2000] 3 MLJ 22; [2000] 6 CLJ 433; [1993] 2 AMR 2266. However, it was submitted that <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> is no longer good law. The alternative argument by the defendants (with regard to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 Evidence Act 1950</LINK>) is not to strike out the impugned paragraphs of the defences based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act</LINK> but to allow the evidence to run and the applicability of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 Evidence Act</LINK> is to be decided by the trial judge at or during the trial. This alternative argument was advanced by Tan Sri Mohamad Shafee of counsel for the 1st defendant/appellant in Appeal No: 153.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Thus, the core issue in these appeals is the applicability of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 Evidence Act</LINK> and whether the defendants are prevented by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 Evidence Act</LINK> from relying on the facts pleaded in the impugned paragraphs of the relevant statement of defences in respect of which the plaintiff had applied to strike out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Opinion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">Section 43 of Evidence Act 1950</LINK> provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

      <b>[11]</b> Having read and re-read <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> above, we are of the view that there is no ambiguity in the section that as a matter of evidence, judgment, order or decree is irrelevant except where the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in issue or that such judgment, order or decree is relevant under some other provisions of the Act. With respect to the last limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> which reads "... or is relevant under some other provisions of this Act", we will come back to address this later. For the time being, suffice for us to say that the only exception, if we may use that expression, that makes judgment, order or decree relevant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> as a matter of evidence is where the judgment, order or decree is relevant for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;40.;;">ss 40</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;41.;;">41</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;42.;;">42 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. However, neither of those three sections are in issue in these appeals and therefore not applicable; nor the judgment in question is a fact in issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We have stated earlier that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act</LINK> is embodiment of the common law laid down by the <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i>. Learned counsel for all the defendants submitted that, we should depart from the rule in <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> in so far as it is relevant to the interpretation or application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act</LINK>. In arguing this proposition it was submitted that the <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> had been criticised heavily by later cases "for its total lack of logic and sense" and therefore no longer good law. To support this argument, reference was made to the views expressed by Lord Denning MR in <i>Goody v. Odhams Press, Ltd</i> [1966] 3 All ER 369. And also in the case of <i>Barclays Bank Ltd v. Cole</i> [1966] 3 All ER 948. In these two cases, Lord Denning MR had expressed the view that the legal position of the <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> rule on the relevancy of a criminal judgment or decision in a civil proceeding or action should be reviewed. In fact very much later the law in England on this point was changed by way of legislative intervention as recommended by the Law Reform Committee.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Learned counsel for the defendants also pointed out to us that the highest Court in New Zealand had also criticised <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> as early as 1969 in the case of <i>Jorgensen v. News Media (Auckland) New Zealand Ltd</i> [1969] NZLR 961 and had refused to follow it. It was further submitted that closer to home, Singapore has an identical provision to our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 Evidence Act</LINK> and that Singapore has overcome the problem posed by their <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;45.;;">s 45 Evidence Act</LINK> by a legislative amendment with the introduction of s 45A. Learned counsel for the defendants cited the Singapore case of <i>Choo Michael v. Loh Shak Mow</i> [1994] 1 SLR 584, where the learned High Court Judge had expressed the opinion that <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> would definitely have been overruled by the House of Lords.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> However, we make two observations. First, though Lord Denning MR in the two English cases cited by the defendants' counsel had been critical of the <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> decision on the issue, the Master of the Rolls did not go so far as to say that it was no longer good law then. In fact in <i>Barclays (supra)</i> the Master of the Rolls said in respect of the rule in <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i>: "... it is made possible by the unfortunate decision of the court in <i>Hollington v. F Hewthorn &amp; Co Ltd</i> where it was held that a conviction in a criminal court cannot be used as evidence, not even <i>prima facie</i> evidence in a civil case. I hope that it soon will be altered."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is observed that in <i>Barclays (supra)</i> the other two Lord Justices, ie Dankwert LJ and Salmon LJ although agreeing with Lord Denning MR's criticisms of <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> also did not make any pronouncement to the effect of over-ruling or refusing to follow-line <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> rules. It appears that the rule in <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> would have been applicable but for the legislative intervention that amended the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Secondly, in respect of the Singapore decision in <i>Choo Michael</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i>, the learned High Court Judge had referred to the judgment of Lord Diplock in <i>Hunter v. Chief Constable of the West Midlands and Another</i> [1981] 3 All ER 727 and expressed the view that the <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> "would have been expressly overruled by the House of Lords if it had not been abolished earlier by statute", and decided not to follow <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i>. We note that the decision in <i>Choo Michael</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> was in 1993. At that material time s 45 of the Singapore Evidence Act (Chapter 97) which is in <i>pari materia</i> with our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> was, and still in force. The learned judge had not considered the effect of s 45 of the Singapore Evidence Act which is the statutory provision applicable then regarding the issue of relevancy and admissibility of previous criminal conviction or judgment in relation to a civil action. Instead, the learned judge had concentrated mainly on the common law position by looking at the English cases and cases from other common law jurisdictions such as United States and New Zealand. We also note that the effect of s 45 of the Singapore Evidence Act on the relevancy and admissibility of previous criminal conviction or judgment by or before a Singapore Court as evidence for the purpose of proving in any proceeding the fact that a person had committed the offence which is in issue was altered only in 2014 with the introduction of a new s 45A in the Singapore Evidence Act. In our view the Singapore decision in <i>Choo Michael</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> is not an accurate precedent to follow. This is because we have <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> which is a statutory provision that expressly provides for the relevancy or otherwise of previous criminal conviction or judgment in a subsequent civil action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In this regard, we agree with the statement by the learned Judicial Commissioner in this case at para 27 of his written grounds of judgment as quoted earlier. The courts do not make laws. That is the prerogative of the legislature. The courts only interpret and apply the laws made and passed by the legislature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Learned counsel for the 1st defendant in Appeal No: 153 further submitted that though the remarks by the learned Justice Hamid Mohamed FCJ in the 2004 sodomy case which involved the plaintiff, could be said to be only an opinion, it is nevertheless an opinion based on evidence and that it had formed part of the court judgment. Therefore the defendants may rely on it to support the defence of justification, fair comment and qualified privilege. It was argued that the word 'judgment' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> ought to include opinions. We are perplexed by this argument. We think learned counsel is trying to split hairs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> No doubt judgment of court consists of opinion of the court as to the facts and evidence adduced before it. However, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> is very clear that judgment, order and decree is irrelevant unless they can be brought within the "exception" under the section. In this respect, learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted if <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> prohibits a judgment to be brought in as evidence, fortiori reasons or opinions which are obiter in the judgment cannot also be brought in as evidence. We agree with this submission.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Learned counsel for the 1st defendant in Appeal No: 153 argued that the remark by the Federal Court in the 2004 case is not an orbiter but it is an opinion based on evidence. However, we must emphasise that the remark was based on inadmissible evidence. So technically and judicially speaking therefore, there is no evidence to support that remark. In the circumstances, it remains a personal opinion of the learned judge who had expressed it. Thus, such remarks as evidence of facts in another case would have little or no probative value.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> is in <i>pari materia</i> with s 43 of the Indian Evidence Act. Based on the Indian authorities cited to him, learned Judicial Commissioner concluded that the rationale for the enactment <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> is that every case is to be treated as a class by itself; and the production of a previous judgment merely establishes the existence of a prior decision. There is no presumption that a prior judgment is the correct decision on the matter. What the law of <i>res judicata</i> establishes is that one cannot go behind the decision in certain similar factual cases based on the ground of public policy. The fact in issue in each case must be proved independently.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The rational underlying <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> can be gleaned from the statement in <i>Hollington</i>'s case <i>(supra)</i> which is as follows: "The court which has to try the claim for damages knew nothing of the evidence that was before the criminal court. It cannot know what arguments were addressed to the court or what influence the court in arriving at its decision. Moreover, the issue in the criminal proceeding in not identical with that raised in claim for damages.". In other words, as said in the Indian case of <i>Gopalkrishna Gupthan v. Ammalu Ammal</i> [1972] AIR KER 196:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In the face of overwhelming authorities locally and from foreign jurisdictions in particular UK (before the statutory intervention) and India that had been considered by the learned Judicial Commissioner that a judgment in a criminal case cannot be used as proof of a fact in issue in a civil case for claim for damages, we are inclined, as the learned Judicial Commissioner did, to agree with the above statement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Therefore, with regard to the defendants' defence of justification, we are in agreement with the learned Judicial Commissioner that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act</LINK> would be a bar to the defendants to rely on the judgment or order or decree of another court proceeding more so it is a criminal proceeding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Now, we address specifically Appeal No: 261 where the plaintiff appealed against the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner dismissing the plaintiff's application to strike out the same paragraph in the defendants' defence in relation to the defence of qualified privileges and fair comment. The rationale for the learned Judicial Commissioner for so deciding is that the defence of qualified privilege attached to the occasion or circumstances of the publication of the defamatory statement rather than the statement itself. It is immaterial if the statement may later turn out to be untrue provided the defendants had acted responsibly and not totally indifferent or reckless as the truth of the statement. It was rationalised that the defence of qualified privilege was predicated on the issue of public interest and responsible journalism and that the media has a duty to disseminate information of public importance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> With regard to the defence fair comment, the learned Judicial Commissioner said that the defendants had the right to this defence of fair comment for the impugned statement are comments and expression of opinion of the judgment commented upon.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It appears to us that the learned Judicial Commissioner is adopting different test when applying <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> - one test for plea of justification and another for plea of qualified privilege and fair comments. In our view this is not a proper way to interpret and apply a statutory provision. There should be only one test; and that is whether the judgment relied on is relevant. We are of the view that once it is decided that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> a judgment in another proceeding is not relevant to the civil proceeding at hand, then it is not relevant for all purposes unless it can be brought within the "exception". On this issue, with respect, we disagree with the learned Judicial Commissioner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The next issue which we would like to discuss is the submission by learned counsel for 2nd defendant and 3rd defendant that criminal judgment is relevant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;52.;;">ss 52</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">55 of the Evidence Act</LINK> to show bad character of the plaintiff that would have impact on claim of damages. This is where the argument by the learned counsel as regard to the last limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43</LINK> which says "... or is relevant under any other provision in this Act", is relevant. Learned Judicial Commissioner, after considering the pleadings, concluded that it is relevant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">s 55 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> because the defendants are not seeking to rely on a single conviction to establish bad character but also seeking to rely on the pronouncement of the Federal Court as well as on the evidence of witnesses to be called at the trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The argument by the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant and 3rd defendant raised the issue of interplay between <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;52.;;">s 52</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;53.;;">s 53</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;54.;;">s 54</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">s 55 of the Evidence Act</LINK>. However, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;53.;;">s 53</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;54.;;">s 54</LINK> only apply to criminal proceedings. Therefore, it is not relevant in a civil proceeding. Thus, the learned counsel reliance on explanation 2 in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;54.;;">s 54</LINK> is, in our view, misplaced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In civil proceedings, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;52.;;">s 52</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">s 55</LINK> are the relevant provisions. Under these two provisions, conviction for criminal offence is not relevant as evidence of bad character. Furthermore, the explanation to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">s 55</LINK> makes it very clear that only evidence of general reputation and general disposition is admissible to prove bad or good character. It cannot be proved by a particular act. In this regard, we think that the Judicial Commissioner had erred in concluding that the defendants is relying on general reputation and disposition. On the facts, we are of the view that the defendants by relying on the conviction of the plaintiff in the second sodomy case and the remark by the Federal Court as to the plaintiff's act of homosexual activities in the first sodomy case are in fact relying on particular acts to show general reputation and general disposition of the plaintiff. We do not think that this is correct and permissible by virtue of the explanation to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;55.;;">s 55</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Based on the above reasonings, we are unanimous that the appeal by the defendants in Appeal No: 153 and 249 be dismissed with costs in the sum of RM5,000.00 to the respondent for each appeal; and that the appeal by the plaintiff in Appeal No: 261 be allowed with costs of RM5,000.00 to the appellants. All deposits to be refunded to the respective appellants.</p>
