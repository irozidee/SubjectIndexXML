    <p>The appellant was a local authority while the respondent was involved in erecting outdoor advertising billboard and earning an income through its clients. At the material time, the licensing of an outdoor advertising billboard built by the respondent on state land was done by, amongst others, applying for Temporary Occupation License ("TOL") obtained from the Land Administrator. However, the Selangor State Government issued a circular ("the circular") to its local authorities that all applications for TOL could no longer be made by the billboard operators, in this case the respondent, but would be made by the local authority, ie the appellant, to the Land Administrator. The respondent would then be required to rent the land/site from the local authority. If the respondent refused to do so, the local authority would issue a notice of eviction and demolish the existing structure and offer the site to another billboard operator. Subsequently, the respondent received a letter from the appellant charging a fee for TOL, Structural Permit and Advertising License. The respondent refused to pay, but after various correspondences the appellant reduced the fee, which the respondent duly paid. Later, in accordance with the circular, the appellant directed the respondent to enter into a Billboard Site(s) Sub-License Agreement ("Sub-License Agreement"). The respondent alleged that the Sub-License Agreement contained terms which were illogical, unfair, prejudicial to the respondent, where the appellant conferred upon itself the rights to have a say in the respondent's company shareholding and accordingly refused to enter into the Sub-License Agreement. Consequently, the appellant withdrew the offer to enter into the Sub-License Agreement with immediate effect and the respondent was given an ultimatum to remove its billboard structure. The respondent filed an application for judicial review in the High Court, where the trial judge was satisfied that in imposing the Sub-License Agreement on the respondent, the appellant had acted <i>ultra vires</i> its powers; had acted illegally and/or in contravention of the law; and had acted unreasonably, grossly disproportionately and was motivated by factors which were irrelevant. In the instant appeal, the main issues to be decided were, <i>inter alia</i>, whether the appellant could enter into commercial contracts; whether the appellant in its function as a body corporate could be challenged by judicial review; whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK> in particular 'assignment' was applicable to government bodies such as the local authority, ie the appellant; whether the court could invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK> to say the Sub-License Agreement was illegal; whether the act of the appellant was <i>ultra vires</i> its powers; and whether the terms and conditions placed in the Sub-License Agreement was unreasonable, grossly disproportionate and was motivated by factors which were irrelevant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> As a general rule, a body corporate, if separate legal entity principles apply, can enter into any form of transaction with private parties. Such matters if it is a state corporation will usually be a policy matter in relation to the state authority or local authority by the State Government. Thus, such powers exercised as a body corporate cannot be challenged by way of judicial review. This can be 'expressly or reasonably inferred' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;13.;;">s 13 Local Government Act 1976 ("LGA")</LINK>. Here, the public function of local authorities and its function as a body corporate (legal entity) must be distinguished. The function of a body corporate was not synonymous with the function of local authorities. In this instance, the respondent's argument that there was no single express provision allowing the appellant to enter into the business of renting TOL to billboard operators was incorrect. Being a separate legal entity, the appellant could enter into commercial contracts, subject to the control of the State Government and/ or State Authority itself and the policy of the day. If such policy consideration related to private contracting parties as opposed to public, then as a general rule it would not be amenable to judicial review. (<i>Salomon v. A Salomon Co Ltd (refd)</i>). (para 15(b) &amp; (e))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> On the issue of illegality, the 'assignment' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK> was intended for the purpose of the public and had nothing to do with government bodies such as the local authority. The parties here did not furnish any cases that a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK> assignment was applicable also to a local authority. Further, the Sub-License Agreement did not say in certain terms that the appellant had obtained TOL but what was clear was that the appellant possessed the requisite legal rights in respect of the land and the respondent would be given a license to erect the billboard and not 'occupy land' as in the case of TOL granted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK>. The Sub-License Agreement was not an assignment of any rights as alleged by the respondent to attract <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 of NLC</LINK>, and hence the court could not invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK> to say it was 'illegal'. (paras 15(h), 17 &amp; 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> What was important to note in this case in respect of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine was the power of the State Authority to control the local authority, ie the appellant. If the State Authority's act was <i>ultra vires</i> the law, the challenge should have been against the decision of the State Authority and not the local authority. In the instant case, the challenge on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK> and the circular issued on the ground of <i>ultra vires</i> could not be taken against the local authority in view of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;9.;;">s 9 LGA 1976</LINK>. Further, based on the Sub-License Agreement, it was difficult to fathom how the restricted right of user even in the event the TOL had been given to the appellant would amount to a transfer or assignment under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK> for the respondent to argue that the terms of the Sub-License Agreement was in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK> and to sustain the ground of illegality. Therefore, there was no prohibition for the appellant to enter into the Sub- License Agreement and collect whatever consideration it deemed fit and with whatever terms as a body corporate. The act of the appellant was further legitimised by the circular, which was authorised by law pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;9.;;">s 9(1) LGA</LINK>. (paras 22-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The conduct of the appellant against the respondent could not on the facts be stated as being arbitrary or oppressive or unfair. Following that, the respondent did not furnish any authorities by a commercial user for commercial purpose of state land where the consideration and terms were arbitrary or disproportionate and stood as a ground for challenge by way of judicial review. In addition, when dealing in a commercial transaction with a commercial vendor within the powers set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;13.;;">s 13 LGA</LINK>, it would be a prudent exercise for the appellant to place any terms and conditions in the best interest of the public to ensure that appropriate consideration was collected from the respondent and to demand transparency of accounts to ensure that there was no default in payment by the respondent. Thus, the court should not interfere or be slow to interfere with any commercial deals more so when the revenue would benefit the public unless the issue involved the responsibility of the local authority to the public. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The respondent had therefore not made out a case for judicial review on the grounds that the terms imposed by the appellant in the Sub-Licensing Agreement were <i>ultra vires</i> its powers; illegal and/or in contravention of the law; and unreasonable, grossly disproportionate and motivated by factors which were irrelevant.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's appeal against the decision of learned High Court Judge allowing the judicial review application in respect of the decision of the appellant to impose 25% of the gross revenue charged by the respondent to its clients for the site rental fee came up for hearing on 13 October 2014 and upon hearing able submissions by both parties, we reserved judgment. My learned brothers Balia Yusof Wahi JCA and Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The instant case is related to a rental agreement (private law) which the respondent has refused to sign on the basis that the appellant is in breach of law and has not provided favourable terms to the respondent as was done in earlier transactions. In essence, the complaint is related to a contractual license, (ie willing licensor and willing licensee) and has nothing to do with an infringement of the right of the respondent in an administrative decision <i>per se</i> for the complaint of the respondent to be ventilated by way of judicial review. Government and/or related agencies' decision on administrative action can be a matter of challenge by the process of judicial review and not one relating to contracts, unless it is in violation of the Federal Constitution or law or Public Policy or colourable arbitrary exercise of power which will cause or had caused loss to the public as well as to the state exchequer, etc. The challenge must be taken by a member of the public or interested bodies and not generally by a contracting party. We will further elaborate on this issue in this judgment. At times the distinction may be thin and a common sense approach needs to be taken to ensure a commercial vendor does not take benefit (which should rightly go for the ultimate benefit of the public) as opposed to a member of the public who needs the service of the local authority at affordable rates.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> There are a number of decisions to support the above proposition in India as well as in Malaysia, notwithstanding the general rule that statutory authorities and/or corporation can do only those things which it is authorised to do by statute. For example:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To Local Authorities And Doctrine Of <i>Ultra Vires</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The locus classicus case on <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine in relation to local authorities or corporation is the case of <i>Baroness Wenlock &amp; ors v. River Dee Co</i> [1885] 10 AC 354, where His Lordship Lord Watson opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> His Lordship had anchored the argument based on the proposition that what the corporation may legitimately pursue must be ascertained from the Act failing which the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> will set in. Over the years the strict rule has been whittled down and the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> has also been modified in the company statutes in England, India as well as Malaysia. [See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;20.;;">s 20 of Companies Act 1965</LINK>]. In fact, the strict jurisprudence relating to <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine as enunciated in <i>Baroness</i> case must now be seen as a ghost of the past in corporate law jurisprudence, and has limited application only to state created corporation, etc.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The position in India as well as England is that the legislature had not provided extensive power to the local authorities to act as a separate legal entity and in consequence the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine has been followed to a large extent as enunciated in <i>Baroness</i> case and with some general exceptions when the claim is a private law or is a hybrid of private law as well as public law remedy. Learned authors HWR Wade &amp; CF Forsyth in their book titled '<i>Administrative Law</i>' at p 220 have this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In Malaysia the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;;">Local Government Act 1976 (LGA 1976)</LINK> at least gives two types of powers to local authorities which will be discussed further in the judgment. And <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;13.;;">s 13 of LGA 1976</LINK> which recognises separate legal entity principle is unique to Malaysia and is not found in England and or India when related to local authorities. In consequence the proposition in <i>Baroness</i>' case when it relates to commercial transaction of the local authority and a private party the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> will have no application or limited application and it all depends on the facts of the case. Court is most likely to quash the decision of local authority if it ventures into commercial transaction which exposes them to liability such as giving guarantee, etc as opposed to making use of idle land of the state and generating an income for the public benefit without any exposure of liability as in the instant case. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1994_3_142;"><i>Aluminium Company Of Malaysia Berhad v. Ng Than Chai &amp; Anor</i> [1994] 3 MLRH 142</LINK>; [1994] 3 MLJ 544; [1994] 4 CLJ 97; [1994] 3 AMR 2246]. In abundance of caution, we must say all act of Government or public and/or local authorities are always subject to judicial review and/or by way of constitutional challenge even when entering into contract. And when it relates to constitutional challenge, time may not be a factor. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_481;"><i>Racha Urud &amp; Ors v. Ravenscourt Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 481</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 661; [2014] 4 CLJ 393]. If the term of the contract compromises the public right or state exchequer etc; the court is duty bound to strike down the infringing part on the grounds it will be <i>ultra vires</i> or void to exercise the powers to the detriment of the public. [See <i>Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald</i> [1883] 8 App Cas 623; <i>Vijaya Kumar Gupta</i> (infra)]. In consequence, even parties entering into commercial contracts such as the instant case with the Government or statutory bodies or its alike must be vigilant not to be a party to a term which is detriment to the public and/or state exchequer, etc; as such contract or term is not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminaries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned judge had written a 30 page comprehensive judgment setting out the facts and law. It will stand as a speaking judgment. However, the judgment has failed to take into account that the issue here involves a contractual deal and not a deprivation or infringement of a right by administrative action that the respondent is entitled in law, to attract the jurisprudence relating to judicial review.</p>

      <b>[9]</b> This case <i>inter alia</i> involves the jurisprudence relating to Temporary Occupation Licences (TOL), its terms, right to use land for specific purpose per se and the applicability of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 of National Land Code (NLC)</LINK>.

      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant is a local authority and the respondent is involved in erecting outdoor advertising billboard and earning an income through its clients who place the advertisement on the billboard. The case concerns the licensing of an outdoor advertising billboard built by the respondent on a state land. It must be noted that 'billboard business' is a lucrative business for the operator and these can be seen from many reported decision from the court and also news published in the public media. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2012_5_367;"><i>Capital Billboards Sdn Bhd v. Asia Posters Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2012] 5 MLRH 367</LINK>].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The legal framework governing the operation of billboard business as set out by the respondent can be summarised as below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is not in dispute the above was the modus operandi of billboard business from early 2006 to 2008 between the Land Administrator, the relevant authorities and the respondent. The complaint of the respondent in essence is related to item (i) above. The complaint of the respondent before the learned judge is well articulated by the learned counsel for the respondent in their submission. Much judicial time will be saved by repeating it verbatim and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant has filed a lengthy memorandum of appeal even though at the opening of the submission they have limited their arguments to the issues relating to the circular and illegality relating to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 NLC</LINK>. For purpose of deliberation, we have taken the liberty to reproduce the relevant parts of the memorandum of appeal verbatim. The complaint in the memorandum of appeal reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We have read the appeal record and the submissions of the parties in detail. We take the view the appeal should be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We have read the Sub-License Agreement several times. The recital 1.1 does not say in certain terms that the appellant had obtained TOL but what is clear is that the appellant posses the requisite legal rights in respect of the land and the respondent will be given a license to erect the billboard and not 'occupy land' (at the exclusion of others) as in the case of TOL granted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68</LINK>. The Sub-License Agreement is not an assignment of any rights as alleged by the respondent to attract <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 of NLC</LINK>. The recital 1.1 of the agreement says as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As we stated earlier, a sub-license in the instant case has nothing to do with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68</LINK> relating to assignment for the court to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 of NLC</LINK> and say it was 'illegal'. The definition of Sub-License in the agreement reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> TOL mentioned in the Sub-licensing agreement cannot be equated to TOL under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68 of NLC</LINK> as the definition is precarious in that it does not say in uncertain terms the appellant has obtained a TOL and is assigning the TOL to the respondent. The definition of TOL under the Sub-License Agreement is defined as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> This definition is not the same as the definition of TOL in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code</LINK>. Temporary occupation License is defined under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the NLC</LINK> and means 'a license issued under Chapter 2 of Part Four of the NLC which relates to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;65.;;">s 65</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;69.;;">69 of the NLC</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;65.;;">Section 65</LINK> makes it clear that the State Authority can give TOL. And State Authority means under the definition the 'Ruler or Governor of the State'. It is trite the Executive Head of the State Government is the 'Ruler or Governor of the State' as the case may be. [See the Constitution of Selangor 1959]. All local authorities of the State Government come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Government. This means State Government has wide powers to control the local authorities and to ensure their effectiveness and efficiency. In article titled '<i>Introduction to Local Government in Malaysia</i>, the author Dilly M Hill (1974) observes:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Local governments are usually referred to as Majlis and the appellant is a local Government and is subject to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;;">LGA 1976</LINK> as per the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;;">Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>. "Local authority" means any municipal council, town council, town board, local council, rural board, sanitary board or similar local authority established by a written law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> What is important to note in our case in respect of <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine is the power of the State Authority to control the local authorities, in this case the appellant. If the State Authority's act is <i>ultra vires</i> any of the law, the challenge must be against the decision of the State Authority and not the local authority. In the instant case, the challenge on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68</LINK> and the circular issued on the ground of <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine (if any) cannot be taken against the local authorities in view of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;9.;;">s 9 of LGA 1976</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In addition, cl 3.0 of Sub-Licensee Agreement is only a restricted right of user and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It is difficult even to fathom how the restricted right of user even in the event the TOL had been given to the appellant will amount to a transfer or assignment under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68</LINK> for the respondent to argue that the terms of the Sub- License Agreement is in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;68.;;">s 68</LINK> and sustain the ground of illegality to quash the decision. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1983_1_381;"><i>Paruvathy d/o Murugiah v. Krishnan s/o Doraisamy</i> [1983] 1 MLRA 381</LINK>; [1983] 2 MLJ 121]. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_81;"><i>Tindok Besar Estate Sdn Bhd v. Tinjar Co</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 81</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 229, Chang Min Tat CJ had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And in the same case, Lee Hun Hoe CJ (Borneo) had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In our considered view, there will be no prohibition for the appellant to enter into the Sub-License Agreement and collect whatever consideration it deems fit and with whatever terms as a body corporate. The act of the appellant is further legitimised by the policy and guidelines circular dated 26 August 2008 and its subsequent amendment. The said circular is authorised by law pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;9.;;">s 9(1) of LGA1976</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;9.;;">Section 9 of the LGA 1976</LINK> must be read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the National Land Code</LINK>, which places State Authority in control of land matter, in particular TOL even though the issuing authority of the TOL will be the Land Administrator, etc, under the umbrella of the State Authority. We do not see how the lawful exercise of powers vested in the State Authority and the issuance of circular will be <i>ultra vires</i> or illegal for the court to quash the decision on those grounds, more so when the State Authority or State Government is not a party to the action. The submission of the appellant on this issue has merits. And that part of the submission <i>inter alia</i> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We do not see why the payment for the user of the license by a commercial vendor for commercial purpose need to be restricted in any manner as it should be rightly determined by market forces. In the instant case, we also note that the appellant had given much concession and reduced the fees and the conduct of the appellant cannot on the facts be stated as arbitrary or oppressive or unfair in the common sense. The respondent has not furnished us any authorities by commercial user for commercial purpose of state land where the consideration and terms were arbitrary or disproportionate and stood as a ground for challenge by way of judicial review. In addition, we must say that when dealing in commercial transaction with commercial vendor within the powers set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_171;13.;;">s 13</LINK> it will be a prudent exercise for the appellant to place any terms and conditions in the best interest of the public to ensure that appropriate consideration is collected from the respondent and to demand transparency of accounts, etc (which the respondent complains) to ensure that there is no default in payment by respondent. In essence, court should not interfere or be slow to interfere with any commercial deals more so when the revenue will benefit the public unless the issue really involves the responsibility of the local authority to the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We are of the considered view notwithstanding the well reasoned and speaking judgment of the learned trial judge, the respondent has not made out a case for judicial review on the grounds that the terms imposed by the appellant in the Sub-Licensing Agreement are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> For reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed. The judgment of the High Court is set aside, with costs here and below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
