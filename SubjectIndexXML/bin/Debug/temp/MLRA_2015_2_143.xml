    <p>The appellant was charged for murdering his employer by slashing him with a parang. Consequently, the appellant was charged with murder and found guilty by the High Court judge ("the trial judge") and convicted and sentenced to death. Hence this appeal, in which the appellant contended that the trial judge had erroneously ruled out the defence of provocation under exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 Penal Code</LINK> and had, in so deciding, applied a wrong standard of proof on the defence. Therefore, the issues to be considered were, <i>inter alia</i>, whether no reasonable man belonging to the same class of society as the appellant and placed in the same situation in which the appellant was placed, would have been so provoked as to lose his self-control; whether there was any authority for the proposition that provocation could be cumulative; and whether a gradual and accumulated provocation could constitute a defence under exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In order to succeed with the defence of provocation, first it must be determined what a reasonable man would do under the circumstances depending upon the cultural, social and emotional background of the society to which the accused belongs. Secondly, the provocation must be grave and sudden, and have, by its gravity and suddenness deprived the accused of the power of self-control. In this instance, the trial judge had found that no reasonable man belonging to the same class of society as the appellant and placed in the same situation in which the appellant was placed, would have been so provoked as to lose his self-control. Having rightly stated the principles of law on the application of the defence of provocation, there was no reason to disturb the trial judge's finding or to interfere with the assessment of the evidence and the findings of fact made upon the same. (<i>Che Omar Mohd Akhir v. PP (refd); Mancini v. PP (refd) and R v. Camplin (refd)</i>). (paras 14-21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In <i>PP v. Samer Klom Klom</i>, the provocation which the court took into consideration was the one that happened on the day of the murder itself, and there was no basis to conclude that the case was an authority for the proposition that provocation could be cumulative. While in <i>Che Omar Mohd Akhir v. PP</i>, the court opined that there was no such thing as gradual and accumulated provocation that amounted to grave and sudden provocation, and such a provocation was not sufficient to constitute a defence under exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 Penal Code</LINK>. Accordingly, in the present case, the trial judge's findings that the provocation was not sudden and grave to reduce the charge of murder against the appellant to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder within the meaning of exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 Penal Code</LINK> was correct. (<i>PP v. Lasakke (refd)</i>). (paras 28-34)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Balia Yusof Wahi JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged for murdering his employer by slashing him with a 'parang'. There were two eye witnesses to the crime (SP2 and SP3) who both testified that they saw the appellant coming towards the deceased with a 'parang' in his hand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The two further stated that just immediately before striking the blow, the appellant did utter words to the effect "anak pelacur, 10 bulan tidak bayar gaji dan tidak mahu berikan pasport." Another witness, who was another employee of the deceased also saw the appellant holding a parang and chasing the deceased who was running toward his vehicle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> After slashing the deceased, the appellant was seen running into the bungalow of the deceased nearby and coming out later carrying a jewellery box.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> A post mortem conducted on the deceased revealed that he suffered 18 injuries, mainly slash wounds. The cause of death was stated to be caused by a slash wound at the back of his head likely to be caused by a sharp heavy object such as a 'parang' or a sword.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The appellant was found guilty by the learned High Court Judge. He was convicted and sentenced to death. He appeals to the Court of Appeal against the said conviction and sentence and upon hearing the same, this court had dismissed the said appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The issue raised by the appellant in this appeal centred mainly on the learned trial judge's consideration of the defence. It was submitted that the learned trial judge had erroneously ruled out the defence of provocation and had, in so deciding, applied a wrong standard of proof on the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We deem it appropriate to set out the defence of the appellant in some details which are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 11 June 2011, the deceased had assaulted him because he had asked for his salary and passport. He had contacted his father to inform that he was not being treated well by the deceased. The appellant said that his father had called the deceased and asked the deceased to return the passport. This had irked the deceased who later scolded the appellant. The deceased was alleged to have assaulted the appellant on his hand using a piece of object like a steel ruler. The deceased also abused him verbally with vulgarity by saying that he was a child of a prostitute and scolded him for calling his father. After the scolding the appellant went back to his room and told two other co-workers that he was assaulted by the deceased. His head was bleeding. The appellant further said that he was in pain and stayed alone in the said room that night. Whilst in the room, his father called and asked whether the deceased had come to see him to which the appellant replied that the deceased did come and had assaulted him. His father also asked whether he had made a police report, to which he replied it was not necessary and he will continue to work with the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the following day, 12 June 2011, Ganesan came to his room and he told Ganesan that he was assaulted by the deceased for asking the deceased for his salary and the return of his passport. Ganesan then took him to a clinic in Kapar for treatment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The doctor who treated the appellant (SD3) testified that on 12 June 2011 the deceased had called him to inform that one of his workers had injured his right hand. The call was at about 11am. The appellant was brought to the clinic by an Indian man. According to SD3, the nature of the injury was a clear cut lacerated wound on the right hand on both sides, front and back. He was further told by the person who brought the appellant that the appellant had injured his hand while changing the bulb and fell down. The glass bulb broke and cut the appellant's hand. SD3 further testified that he put a question mark in a clinical note of the appellant as to the cause of the injury as he was not sure whether it was caused by a glass cut or by other object. He did ask the appellant what had caused his injury but the appellant did not answer and that was why he had put a question mark in the said clinical note. He treated the appellant by doing stitches on both sides of the hand and on the little finger. There were two injuries on the appellant's hand, one was at the wrist and the other was on the little finger.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellants' father (SD2) was the other witness called by the defence. In his evidence, SD2 stated that he had called the deceased to ask about the well being of his son. SD2 also stated that he had mentioned to the deceased that his son had not received his salary and further said that if the deceased does not want to pay the salary, to send the appellant back to India. SD 2 also stated that on 11 June 2011 the appellant had informed him that he was not well and had remained in his room. On hearing that, SD2 tried to call the deceased two or three times but of no avail. On the 12 June 2011 again he tried calling the deceased at about 6.00pm Indian time which was approximately about 8.30pm Malaysian time but there was no reply from the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On the 13 June 2011 that is the day of the incident, SD2 said he called the deceased and the deceased said to him 'anak pelacur' (prostitute child) and handed the phone to the appellant and SD2 had a conversation with the appellant. In the said conversation, SD2 said the appellant had told him not to make frequent calls for fear that he would be assaulted by the deceased. SD2 further stated that the deceased took away the handphone from the appellant and the deceased had a conversation with him. In the said conversation, SD2 stated that the deceased had said; "Anak pelacur dan dia lahir untuk kamu ke atau untuk orang lain. Sekiranya kamu menelefon saya lagi saya akan menghantar anak kamu sebagai mayat" to him. SD2 pleaded with the deceased not to do so and asked the deceased to just send his son back. Immediately thereafter, the deceased switched off the phone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The defence case is premised on exception (1) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In order to bring a defence of grave and sudden provocation within the exception (1) to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>, the following facts need to be established:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Whether the provocation was grave and sudden as to make an accused person lose his self control is a question of fact and not one of laws ( see: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_285;"><i>Che Omar Mohd Akhir v. PP</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 285</LINK>; [2007] 4 MLJ 309; [2007] 3 CLJ 281; [1999] 3 AMR 2593). In <i>Mancini v. PP</i> [1941] 3 All ER 273 it was stated that whether the provocation is grave and sudden, the test to be applied is an objective one that is to say what would be the effect of the provocation on a reasonable man. An unusually excitable or pugnacious individual is not entitled to rely on provocation which would not have led an ordinary person to act as he did. In applying the said test, two relevant factors must be considered namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The Supreme Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_275;"><i>Lorensus Tukan v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 275</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 251; [1988] 1 CLJ 162 had made an observation that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> What a reasonable man would do under the circumstances depends upon the customs, manners, way of life, traditional values, etc. In short, the cultural, social and emotional background of the society to which the accused belongs. It is for the court to decide in each case having regard to all the relevant circumstances. In order to succeed, the provocation must be, (a) grave and sudden; and (b) have, by its gravity and suddenness deprived the accused of the power of self-control.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> A reasonable man has been defined in <i>R v. Camplin</i> [1978] AC 705 as 'an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possesses of such powers of self-control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned trial judge had found that no reasonable man belonging to the same class of society as the appellant and place him in the same situation in which the appellant was placed, would be so provoked as to lose his self control.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In concluding that the defence of grave and sudden provocation does not apply, the learned trial judge had made the following finding at pp 245 and 246 of Rekod Rayuan Jilid 3:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Having rightly stated the principles of law on the application of the defence of provocation, we see no reason to disturb the learned trial judge's finding and we do not find any sufficient reason to interfere with His Lordship's assessment of the evidence and the findings of fact made upon the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As to what exactly happened during the incident on the fatal night of 13 June 2011, beside saying there was a phone call and the deceased was scolding him and his father with vulgarities, and that just before that he was mopping the floors, the appellant merely said "Semasa marah saya dalam keadaan sedar diri tapi lepas itu saya tidak tahu apa berlaku".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> During cross-examination by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor, the appellant stated "Saya tidak tahu sama ada saya ada menetak Dato" and he denied running away with jewelleries using the deceased's vehicle, the Mitsubishi Storm. Taken in its totality, the learned trial judge was right in concluding that there were some elements of premeditation and more so when the evidence of SP2 and SP3 show that the appellant was seen coming towards the deceased with a 'parang' in his hand while the deceased was seated in the hall. SP2 and SP3 also witnessed the appellant pursuing the deceased to the temple and running towards his vehicle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It ought to be noted that in respect of the calls made by SD2 to the deceased, the prosecution had recalled ASP Chua Hang Loun (SP17) as a rebuttal witness. Specifically on the purported call made by SD2 to the deceased on 13 June 2011, the witness said at pp 174-175 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 2:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> During cross-examination by the appellant's counsel, this rebuttal witness stated that he received the deceased's handphone at 4.00am on 14 June 2011 and frankly admitted that any record of incoming call on the same could have been deleted. At p 176 of the same Rekod Rayuan this witness said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In our view, this is purely hypothetical. There is no evidence to suggest that any deletion of any incoming call to the said handphone was forthcoming. Considering this piece of evidence with the record of incoming and outgoing calls in P89, it would seem that the evidence of the rebuttal witness is more probable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It was the contention of the appellant that there was a series of incidents which started on the 11 June 2011 that culminated in the act of provocation such as not being provided with food, non-payment of salary, retention of passport, no work permit and the assault and the verbal abuse on the night of 13 June 2011 being the incident which 'broke the camel's back'. According to the defence, the provocation took place in the form of utterance of vulgarity about the accused himself, his father and his mother. This was said to have occurred during the conversation that took place on the night of the incident at about 8.30 pm Malaysian time. Learned counsel submitted that provocation can be cumulative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In advancing his argument, learned counsel referred to a passage in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1996_2_239;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Samer Klom Klom</i> [1996] 2 MLRH 239</LINK>; [1996] 2 CLJ 359 in a judgment by Sir Denys Roberts CJ and Hayati Salleh J of the Brunei High Court. At p 259 of the report it was stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1963_1_443;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Lasakke</i> [1963] 1 MLRH 443</LINK>; [1964] 1 MLJ 56, it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> We ought to remind that whether the provocation is grave and sudden as to make an accused person lose or be deprived of his self control is a question of fact. It must depend on the whole circumstances of the case. In <i>Public Prosecutor v. Samer Klom Klom (supra)</i> the court found "that a reasonable man of the accused's community would not be so provoked by what had happened or been said as to lose control of himself. The rejection of a man by his mistress is not uncommon. It cannot, without more, constitute such a degree of provocation as would cause a loss of self-control in a reasonable man." The court rejected the defence of grave and sudden provocation and found him guilty of murder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In <i>Public Prosecutor v. Lasakke (supra)</i>, the accused was found not guilty of murder but guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The deceased had on three occasions tried to have sexual intercourse with the accused's wife and had told the wife to marry him and threatened that if her husband would not divorce her, he would kill him to achieve his purpose. The last occassion was about a month before the death of the deceased. On the day in question, the deceased said to the accused "Eh? Have you divorced your wife yet? Later, while they were in the room, the deceased again hounded the accused with the word "Eh. Are you not ashamed? Don't you realise all your friends know I have interfered with your wife? Why don't you divorce her? The accused did nothing but tears of shame came into his eyes. The accused decided to go home but as he reached the steps, the deceased who was standing there held him and struck him on the forehead. According to the witnesses, both the accused and the deceased were seen struggling for possession of a 'parang' on the verandah near the door. The witnesses, on seeing this, ran away. When they returned the deceased body was found lying on the grass some distance from the house. The deceased suffered severe cut on his head and several other wounds. The court found that the accused was at that moment deprived of the power of self-control as the act of provocation was, having regard to all the circumstances sufficiently grave and sudden.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In our considered view, the passage referred to and relied upon by learned counsel in the Brunei case of <i>Public Prosecutor v. Samer Klom Klom (supra)</i> does not state the correct proposition of law as decided in <i>Public Prosecutor v. Lasakke (supra)</i>. The facts of the case clearly reveal the gravity of the provocation. The provocation which the court took into consideration was the one that happened on the day of the murder itself. Reading the judgment of Simpson J, we found no basis to conclude that the case is an authority for the proposition that provocation can be cumulative. The court found there was a series of grave provocations and it was "the final provocation that was sufficiently grave and sudden to prevent the offence from amounting to murder". We are not inclined to agree and are least persuaded by <i>Public Prosecutor v. Samer Klom Klom (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We are however cognisant of what had been expressed by the Federal Court in the judgment of Nik Hashim FCJ in the case of <i>Che Omar Mohd Akhir v. PP (supra)</i> who opined that "there is no such thing as gradual and accumulated provocation that amounts to grave and sudden provocation. Devoid of its gravity and suddenness, a gradual and accumulated provocation is not sufficient to constitute a defence under exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>." The Federal Court also found in the case, the brutal retaliation by the appellant was not proportionate to the provocation and that a reasonable man placed in the situation and circumstances the appellant was placed, would not have acted as the appellant did.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> For the reasons aforesaid, we are in agreement with the findings of the learned trial judge that in all the circumstances of the case, the provocation is not sudden and grave to reduce the charge of murder against the appellant to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder within the meaning of exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> We unanimously dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence by the High Court.</p>
