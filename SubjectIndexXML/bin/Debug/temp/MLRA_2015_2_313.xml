    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was charged in the High Court with murder and attempted suicide, offences punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">ss 302</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;309.;;">309 of the Penal Code ('Code')</LINK> respectively. After his arrest the appellant was referred for psychiatric observation and treatment. PW5, who examined the appellant, agreed that the appellant was suffering from a mental disorder and that the appellant experienced auditory hallucinations before, during and a short while after the commission of the offence. However, PW5 was of the view that the appellant knew what he was doing at the material time and knew that what he was doing was wrong. DW2, a consultant psychiatrist, found that the appellant was suffering from amphetamine induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations and that the appellant was unable to differentiate between right and wrong at the time of the commission of the offence. Both PW5 and DW2 were on common ground that the appellant was suffering from a severe mental disorder, ie psychosis. They differed on their views on whether the appellant knew what he had done and whether he knew that what he had done was wrong. PW9, who had treated the appellant previously, testified that the appellant had a history of hearing voices and hallucinations - and that these were the features of a person suffering from psychotic problems. Other prosecution witnesses also testified to the abnormal behaviour and confused state of the appellant at the material time. The appellant relied on the defence of insanity under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Code</LINK>. The appellant was however convicted on both charges and sentenced accordingly. He appealed to the Court of Appeal. The only issue was whether the defence had successfully established insanity under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> PW5 had confirmed that the appellant was suffering from a severe mental disorder, ie psychosis at the time of the commission of the offence, as well as before and a short while after the alleged offence. The findings of the two experts, PW5 and DW2, also had the support of PW9. Other prosecution witnesses had also given accounts of the strange and abnormal behavior of the appellant prior to the incident. PW21 - the investigating officer - agreed that the conduct, appearance and mental state of the appellant at the crime scene was consistent with the findings of the medical reports that the appellant was suffering from a severe mental disorder. (paras 22-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was sufficient evidence to accept the defence of insanity under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Code</LINK> in respect of the offences of murder and attempted suicide. The appellant was acting under a delusion and was of unsound mind at the material time. The defence had established on a balance of probabilities that at the time of the commission of the acts, the appellant did not know that what he was doing was wrong or contrary to law. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant did commit the act of causing the death of the victim and attempted suicide but by reason of unsoundness of mind, the appellant ought to be acquitted pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;347.;;">s 347 of the Criminal Procedure Code ('CPC')</LINK>. Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;348.;;">s 348 of the CPC</LINK>, the appellant ought to be kept in safe custody and under medical supervision and treatment at the Kuching Sentosa Hospital pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;348.;;">s 348(2) of the CPC</LINK>.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was faced with two charges in the High Court at Miri. The first charge was for the murder of one Suzana Abol (P), KPT 871012- 13-5310 (the deceased), while the second charge was for attempted suicide, offences punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">ss 302</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;309.;;">309 of the Penal Code</LINK>, respectively. The offences were committed on 29 March 2011. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death by the High Court for the first charge and was sentenced to two months imprisonment in respect of the second charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We do not propose to set out the background facts of the case. Suffice to state that the deceased was a tenant at the appellant's house and that the appellant had a crush on the deceased. PW18 and PW20 were also the tenants at the house and they had testified as to the events immediately prior and after the murder. The evidence revealed that the appellant was seen in front of the deceased's room with the alleged murder weapon. The DNA analysis of the swabs taken from the parang and the knife showed that the profiles were mixed and contributed by at least two sources including those from the appellant and the deceased. The DNA analysis of the nail clippings with bloodstains taken from the deceased also showed a mixed profile and contributed by the appellant and the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> After his arrest, the appellant was referred to Miri Hospital for medical treatment and observation. On 12 April 2011 the appellant was sent to a psychiatric hospital, ie Hospital Sentosa in Kuching, for psychiatric observation and treatment. The appellant was certified by Dr Lau Kim Kah (PW5) to be capable of understanding the charge made against him and to follow court proceedings. He was certified to be fit to plead his case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> PW10 (a pathologist) who conducted the post mortem on the deceased testified that the cause of death was due to the stab wound at the epigastric area penetrating the atrium of the heart causing right haemothorax.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> At the end of the prosecution's case, the learned trial judge found that a <i>prima facie</i> had been made out where the prosecution had established:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> From the evidence of PW5, the learned trial judge found that at the material time, the appellant knew what he was doing and knew that what he was doing was wrong.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In respect of the charge under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;309.;;">s 309</LINK> (the offence of attempting to commit suicide), the learned trial judge had similarly found that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established for the offence of attempted suicide. The evidence revealed that the appellant had cut his own neck and stabbed his own stomach with some broken glasses and that he had sustained a 5cm x 3cm laceration wound over the right side of his neck, a 2cm x 1cm wound on the left side of the neck and a 3cm x 1cm laceration wound over the upper abdomen. All the wounds sustained by the appellant were minor and not life threatening.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> In the grounds of judgment, the learned trial judge states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant raised the defence of insanity pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In his evidence, the appellant stated that on the day of the incident, he was hearing voices. He did not know who the voices were and the voices were controlling him. He said that he could not control himself and cannot use his judgment at that time. He admitted stabbing the deceased with a knife once on her chest but he did not know why he did that. When he kicked open the deceased's room, he told the deceased that if she was not dead, she would suffer in future. The appellant said when he stabbed the deceased, he did not know the act of slashing and stabbing was wrong at that time. He did not regret what he did at that time but regretted his actions when he saw PW5. The appellant further gave evidence that he could not decide against the voices as the voices were controlling him at that time. He said that he would not kill the deceased if not for the voices and that if the deceased did not die, she will suffer from torture in future and he did the act for the deceased's own good. The intention to kill, according to the appellant, was formed because of the voices that told him to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> DW2 (a Consultant Psychiatrist), an expert witness had examined the appellant and had prepared a psychiatrist report (exh D3). DW2 had interviewed the appellant and had gone through the appellant's medical report in Hospital Sentosa and had also interviewed the appellant's brother. DW2's finding was that the appellant was suffering from amphetamine induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations. Due to this disorder the appellant was not able to control himself and was under the influence of hallucinations. According to DW2, the appellant did not know what he was doing at the time of the commission of the offence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On the defence, the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant was thus convicted on both charges, and sentenced accordingly. Hence the appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> There was only one issue canvassed in the appeal, namely whether the defence of insanity under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Penal Code</LINK> had been successfully established by the defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_164;"><i>John Nyumbei v. PP</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 164</LINK>; [2007] 7 MLJ 206: [2007] 2 CLJ 509, Abdull Hamid Embong JCA (as His Lordship then was) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We bear in mind that the burden is on the appellant to prove insanity (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_342;"><i>Juraimi Husin v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 342</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 537; [1998] 2 CLJ 383; [1998] 1 AMR 758 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1960_1_359;"><i>Baharom v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1960] 1 MLRA 359</LINK>; [1960] 1 MLJ 249) and the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1969_1_366;"><i>Goh Yoke v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1969] 1 MLRA 366</LINK>; [1970] 1 MLJ 63 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1976_1_90;"><i>Rajagopal v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1976] 1 MLRA 90</LINK>; [1977] 1 MLJ 6). Thus, if the appellant is able to show, either from the evidence of the prosecution or other evidence that he committed the crime but he was at that time insane, the appellant cannot be held culpable by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Penal Code</LINK> (see <i>John Nyumbei (supra)</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> PW5 agreed that the appellant was suffering from mental disorder, ie psychosis; that auditory hallucinations are the major symptom of psychosis and that the appellant was suffering from auditory hallucinations before, during and a short while after the commission of the offence. PW5 and DW2 were thus on common ground that the appellant was having severe mental disorder, ie psychosis. The divergent view was on whether the appellant knew what he did and that what he did to the deceased and to himself was wrong or contrary to law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned trial judge accepted the opinion of PW5 over that of DW2 on the premise that PW5 was in a better position to evaluate the mental capacity of the appellant having observed the appellant for a much longer time than DW2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> PW5 opined that at the time of the commission of the alleged offences, the appellant was aware of what he was doing and that what he was doing was wrong. We noted from the evidence of PW5 that in coming to the said conclusion, PW5 had essentially based his findings on what the appellant had told him. The following was his explanation in re-examination (p 90: Supp Record of Appeal vol 1):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> DW2, on the other hand, was of the opinion that the appellant was not able to differentiate what is right and wrong on the day of the incident. DW2 had based his opinion not just on what the appellant had told him but on the interview he had with the appellant's brother and on the appellant's medical report in Hospital Sentosa. DW2 had considered that the drugs consumed by the appellant can induce auditory hallucinations if taken over a long period of time. DW2 had also taken into account the fact that prior to the incident, the appellant was behaving differently from his normal self and stated that an abnormal behaviour is one of the symptoms of psychosis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It was DW2's opinion that the voices were controlling the appellant and that the appellant was deluded that if the appellant did not kill the deceased, she will be tormented after his death. Although the appellant was aware of what he was doing, the appellant did not know that what he was doing was wrong at the time of the incident as the appellant was acting on the instruction of the voices and that was why he killed the deceased. According to DW2, a psychotic person will answer according to what is going on in his mind especially if he had hallucination and delusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We find that PW5 had confirmed (p 92: Supp Record of Appeal vol 1) that the appellant was suffering from a severe mental disorder, ie psychosis at the time of the commission of the offence, as well as before and a short while after the alleged offence. PW5 had also testified that it was the appellant's belief, after hearing the voices that the deceased will be tortured and tormented after the appellant's death and that was the motive in killing the deceased, ie to spare the deceased the suffering that she will endure after the appellant's death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The findings of the two experts (PW5 and DW2) that the appellant was suffering from severe mental disorder found support in the evidence of PW9 (a doctor at the Miri General Hospital) that the appellant had a history of "hearing voices" and hallucinations; that these are the features of a person suffering from psychotic problems and that psychosis is a person of unsound mind and abnormal behaviour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Other prosecution witnesses had also given an account on the strange or abnormal behaviour of the appellant prior to the incident. Another tenant (PW18) who was renting a room at the appellant's house with his girlfriend had testified that when he saw the appellant at 4am on 29 March 2011, the appellant had tried to stop PW18 from entering the house by saying "You are not staying here". PW18 testified that the appellant was not normal as the appellant could not recognise him and that the appellant looked fierce and confused. PW20 (PW18's girlfriend) had similarly testified that the appellant looked abnormal when he was sitting and lying on the grass outside the house when she saw him at about 6.30am on the material date. According to PW20, the appellant had never behaved in such a manner before.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> PW21 (the investigating officer), who had met the appellant at the alleged crime scene and who had taken a statement from the appellant, gave evidence that the appellant had told him that the appellant had injured himself and had injured someone else. The appellant had further told PW21 that someone had asked the appellant to kill the deceased. PW21 agreed that the conduct, the appearance and the mental state of the appellant at the crime scene was consistent with the findings of the medical reports that the appellant was suffering from a severe mental disorder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the light of all the above, we find sufficient evidence to accept the defence of insanity under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;84.;;">s 84 of the Penal Code</LINK> in respect of both the alleged offences of murder and attempted suicide. We find that the appellant was acting under delusion and was of unsound mind at the material time. It is our unanimous decision that the defence had established on a balance of probabilities that at the time of the commission of the acts, the appellant did not know that what he was doing was wrong or contrary to law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We made a finding of fact that the appellant did commit the act of causing the death of the victim, Suzana Abol, and attempted suicide; but by reason of unsoundness of mind, we order an acquittal of the appellant pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;347.;;">s 347 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. And pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;348.;;">s 348 of the same Code</LINK>, the appellant is to be kept in safe custody and under medical supervision and treatment at Hospital Sentosa, Kuching, pending the order of His Excellency the Governor of Sarawak pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;348.;;">s 348(2) of the Code</LINK>. As required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;348.;;">s 348(1)</LINK> we shall furnish His Excellency with a report of this case.</p>
