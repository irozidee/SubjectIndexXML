    <p>The respondents were the administrators of the estate of the deceased ("patient") who died from colon cancer on 8 February 2005. The 1st and 2nd appellants were consultant physicians and had treated the patient for ailments relating to food poisoning and gastroenteritis during a period of about 20 years from 7 January 1980 to 15 December 2000. During the 20-year period, both appellants had seen the patient about eight times. The 2nd appellant last attended to the patient on 7 May 1997 whereas the 1st appellant had discovered the patient's colon cancer on 15 December 2000. The respondents contended that the appellants were negligent in failing to diagnose or in misdiagnosing the patient's colon cancer. As a result, the patient had suffered pain, suffering and had to undergo surgery, chemotherapy and radiation until she succumbed on 8 February 2005. The High Court found both appellants liable in medical negligence and they appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellants' appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The "test" for medical negligence refers to mere guidelines developed by the courts to deal with medical negligence. These guidelines take into consideration the facts, circumstances and justice of the case. To describe the guidelines as a "test" in the manner asserted by the appellants, would impinge on the jurisdiction and power of the Malaysian court in dealing with a case and would elevate the test of a foreign jurisdiction to legislative effect. Malaysia subscribes to Constitutional Supremacy and the Malaysian courts could not be tied down to foreign or local case laws with different fact patterns. The Malaysian courts are the supreme arbiter of what is right and wrong and are bound to decide a case based on the facts, the law and the Constitution. The concept of "guidelines" as opposed to "test" in the Malaysian context is more flexible and gives wider room for the court to apply the guidelines according to the facts of the case and come to a just decision with variations, if any as may be deemed necessary, whether the judicial precedent relied on is from Malaysia or some other jurisdiction. (paras 13, 18 &amp; 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The concept of "test" is rigid and is an attempt to turn the judicial decision making into a science. Such rigidity could not be applied to doctors in medical science. The courts' supervision on the conduct of doctors could not be compromised by medical judgment, especially when experts are perceived to be partisan. Medical science is not a precise science. There are risks associated with the judgment of doctors, taking into consideration their years of experience, speciality, etc and the application of the practice and procedures; which need to be balanced with the essential service they provide for the stakeholders. (paras 19-20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The principles of negligence related to medical negligence are not based on the same criteria as ordinary negligence cases. This distinction must be kept in mind to appreciate the distinction, approach and compromises case laws from time to time advances in relation to medical negligence jurisprudence. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> It was not correct for the appellants to argue that the case of <i>Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee </i>('<i>Bolam</i>'s case') had relevance only to diagnosis and treatment and not to medical advice. The <i>Bolam</i>'s principle applies to advice, diagnosis and treatment though the Malaysian position presently is that it does not apply to advice. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Whether it is the <i>Bolam, Bolitho, Rogers v. Whitaker</i> or <i>Foo Fio Na</i> test, the test must be read as guidelines only. The courts are obliged to follow stringently the guidelines to arrive at a just decision on the facts of the case by doing a balancing exercise on the rights, obligation of the parties and circumstances of the case. No one "test" or "guideline" may suit the facts of the case. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b>
      <i>Bolam</i>'s case does not in any way impinge on the role of the Malaysian court to decide on the issue of negligence independently after weighing experts' medical evidence. It is not totally correct to say 'the standard of care is a matter of medical judgment' in the Malaysian context. Further, under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, an expert view, in order to qualify as representative of a "responsible body of medical opinion" has to satisfy the threshold test of logic. (para 30)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> A brief analysis of leading cases relating to medical negligence demonstrates that the courts were not setting out any definitive test for medical negligence. In actual fact, the courts were suggesting useful guidelines to reach a just conclusion, keeping in mind the traditional approach of the courts, only to find liability against doctors when it was really warranted. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The <i>Bolam</i> principle gave the medical profession much desired protection, but was qualified in the case of <i>Bolitho</i><i>Bolam</i>'s case, does not permit the court to find the doctor negligent in preference to one body of distinguished professional opinion to another. <i>Bolam</i>'s case places a high threshold on the plaintiff to establish negligence when the defence can demonstrate differing medical opinion on the issue. In <i>Bolitho</i>'s case, the Court of Appeal qualified the <i>Bolam</i> principle to say that it is not the number of experts by the defence which should determine the issue, but it was the judge who had to consider the evidence. (para 32(e), (f) &amp; (g))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The Malaysian cases which had succumbed to the <i>Bolam</i> principle <i>in toto</i> could only be said to have failed to appreciate the dominant provision of expert opinion and its limitations encapsulated in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. Failure to follow statutory provision in Malaysia such as the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;;">Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> and endorsing judicial precedent from elsewhere undermines the integrity of the decision making process and does not subscribe to the Rule of Law envisaged by the Federal Constitution. (para 32(h))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> The Australian <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle, which was said to be confined to advice and <i>Bolitho</i>'s case, said to be confined to diagnosis and treatment, was only so distinguished through the ingenuity of lawyers and jurists and not as a result of the principles and guidelines in the cases. The <i>Rogers v. Whitaker's</i> case attempted to extend the duty of care between the doctor and the patient to greater heights, to the detriment of the doctors and for the benefit of the patients. The jurisprudence in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> which differed from the <i>Bolam</i>'s principle, ought to have been legislated before being made applicable in Malaysia. (para 32(m) &amp; (n))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> The standard of care as to advice, taking the principles enunciated in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case, must be decided on the basis whether the doctor had acted reasonably and logically and got the facts correct. Such an approach is harmonious with the principles of negligence as well as with the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. (para 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> The Federal Court in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case did not say in any positive terms that the <i>Bolam, Bolitho</i> or <i>Rogers v. Whitaker </i>principles would apply in all cases of medical negligence in Malaysia <i>Bolam, Bolitho</i> and <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principles may apply as guiding principles in medical negligence cases in Malaysia, depending on the issues and facts and the rider the Federal Court had placed. (para 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(13)</b> In <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case, the Federal Court only answered the question posed, whether the <i>Bolam</i> principle should apply to all aspects of medical negligence. In answering the question, the Federal Court rightly ruled in the negative. In allowing the appeal, the Federal Court set aside the Court of Appeal's decision advocating the <i>Bolam</i> principle. The Federal Court did not reject the <i>Bolam</i> principle or the <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle <i>in toto</i> but added a rider, to the effect that the court must ultimately determine whether the doctor had acted reasonably and logically and got his facts right. Consequently, negligence cases in Malaysia could not be decided by medical judgment, but by way of judicial determination. The Federal Court also made it clear that the <i>Bolam</i> principle will not apply to advice, but <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> will. (paras 45-47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(14)</b> In the instant case, three medical experts gave their opinion. None of the expert evidence was discredited or expunged from the records. It was a grave misdirection on the part of the trial judge to disregard the medical expert opinion on the subject in issue to deal with standard of care, in particular relating to medical negligence, in breach of established guidelines set out in <i>Bolam, Bolitho</i>, as well as <i>Foo Fio Na</i>. In addition, it also did not subscribe to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. The trial judge single-handedly attempting to deal with the issue of standard of care without weighing all the medical expert evidence undermined the integrity of the decision making process requiring the appellate court to quash the decision <i>in limine</i>. (para 57(b))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(15)</b> In the instant case, no reasonable tribunal properly appraised of the facts and law would come to the conclusion that the appellants were liable. The appellants had acted reasonably and logically and got their facts correct. (para 57(c))</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants' (1st and 2nd defendants') appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who found them liable in respect of a claim anchored by the respondents (plaintiffs) in medical negligence. The respondents also have a cross-appeal relating to quantum only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It was submitted by learned counsel for the appellants, the standard of care and the test applicable in relation to diagnosis or treatment is still the <i>Bolam</i> Test and that test is dependent on the view of a responsible body of medical practitioners. The appellants relied heavily on the Court of Appeal's decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_134;"><i>Dr Soo Fook Mun v. Foo Fio Na &amp; Anor And Another Appeal</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 134</LINK>; [2001] 2 MLJ 193; [2001] 2 CLJ 457; [2001] 2 AMR 2205. (See <i>Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee</i> [1957] 2 All ER 118). The proposition stated by the learned counsel in the first instance did not subscribe to the development of case laws in England, Malaysia, Australia, etc. (See <i>Bolitho v. City and Hackney Health Authority</i> [1997] 3 WLR 1151 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2006_2_410;"><i>Foo Fio Na v. Dr Soo Fook Mun &amp; Anor</i> [2006] 2 MLRA 410</LINK>; [2007] 1 MLJ 593; [2007] 1 CLJ 229; [2002] 2 AMR 1524 (<i>Foo Fio Na</i>)). The learned counsel also argues that the Federal Court's decision in the <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case will not be applicable in this case and says it is related to medical advice. The learned counsel makes a distinction by saying <i>Bolam</i>'s case is related to diagnosis and treatment and the case of <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> [1992] 175 CLR 479 relates to advice or information to patient. And asserts that the fact of the instant case relates to diagnosis and treatment and in consequence the <i>Bolam</i> Test must be made applicable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> After having heard the submission of the parties, we reserved judgment. My learned sister Badariah Sahamid JCA and learned brother Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA have read the judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts And Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondents are the administrators of the estate of Saradhamani (deceased) who was treated for colon cancer and passed away on 8 February 2005. The 1st and 2nd appellants are consultant physicians who had treated the deceased for minor ailment relating to food poisoning and gastroenteritis during a period of about 20 years from 7 January 1980 to 15 December 2000. On 15 December 2000, the deceased was investigated by the 1st appellant who discovered her colon cancer. The 2nd appellant had last attended to the deceased on 7 May 1997 and in consequence says the writ which was filed on 12 January 2006 was time-barred. However, the learned trial judge had taken the view that the action was not time-barred as the cause of action accrued upon the discovery of colon cancer and not on the last date the 2nd defendant treated her for food poisoning. The learned trial judge's reason at pp 426-427 of the judgment reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The above observation of the learned judge is consonant with the view expressed in the decision of the House of Lords in <i> Cartledge v. E Jopling &amp; Sons Limite</i>d [1963] 1 All ER 341. (See <i>Invercargill City Council v. Hamlin</i> [1996] 1 NZLR 513 and <i>GD Searle &amp; Co v. Gunn</i> [1996] 2 NZLR 129).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It was the respondents' contention that the appellants were negligent in failing to diagnose or in misdiagnosing the deceased's colon cancer. It was contended that by reason of the appellants' negligence, the deceased suffered pain and suffering and had to undergo surgery, chemotherapy and radiation until she succumbed and passed away on 8 February 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> It is not in dispute that during the period of 20 years, the deceased had consulted the 1st and 2nd appellants about eight times. On all those occasions (except one), the diagnosis was related to food poisoning and gastroenteritis. The recovery was quick, that is to say, the deceased was discharged within 24 hours or so and the deceased did not do any follow up or complained of any persisting symptoms. The gap between visits to the consultant ranges between ten months to about two or three years. The learned judge has summarised the visits and diagnosis done. It will be useful to repeat the same to appreciate the conclusion to this judgment, and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

      <b>[8]</b> Learned counsel for the appellants says that, the chart in respect of the deceased's visit to the consultant, the diagnosis, treatment and discharge were appropriate and did not demonstrate any form of negligence and relies on experts' evidence and journal, and/or literature to substantiate the argument.

      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To Cases In Medical Negligence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> There are a number of excellent articles, setting out the development of case laws relating to medical negligence and the applicable test and/or its distinction in our law journals. We do not wish to set them out here in detail. (See <i>The Medical Profession, Societal Demands And Developing Legal Standards</i> [2014] 5 MLJ cxxxvii; <i>Critical Analysis And Acceptability Of Foo Fio Na v Dr Foo Sook Mun &amp; Anor: Valid Concerns?</i> [2010] 1 MLJ xiv; <i>Spousal Consent And medical negligence: A Bridge Too Far?</i> [2014] 4 MLJ cix).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> What is important to note is that, what is described as a 'test' are in actual fact just guidelines by the court to deal with the issue of medical negligence, taking into consideration the facts, circumstances as well as the justice of the case. To describe guidelines as a 'test' in the manner asserted by the appellants, impinges on the jurisdiction and power of the Malaysian court in dealing with a case and elevates the 'test' of a foreign jurisdiction to legislative effect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The law on medical negligence as a starting point could be stated as set out in the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1981_1_319;"><i>Kow Nan Seng v. Nagamah &amp; Ors</i> [1981] 1 MLRA 319</LINK>; [1982] 1 MLJ 128 where Salleh Abbas FJ (as he then was) observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> A useful dicta (cited in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>) explaining the role of court was advocated in the Irish case of <i>Best v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd</i> [1994] 5 Med LR 81, where Finlay CJ stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Another guiding principle was enunciated by the Federal Court in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case which derives from the quote of Lord Woolf's lecture, where it was stated that the phrase 'Doctor knows best' should now be followed by the qualifying words 'if he acts reasonably and logically and gets his facts right'. If the doctor had done so, it absolves him from liability even though his conduct had caused the patient injury, pain, suffering as well as damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The Court of Appeal in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case [2001] 2 MLJ 193; [2001] 1 MLRA 134 had defended the applicability of <i>Bolam</i> Test in Malaysia. The court <i>inter alia</i> held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In country like Malaysia which subscribes to Constitutional Supremacy, the court's hand cannot be tied down based on case laws which originate from other jurisdiction or for that matter in Malaysia when it relates to facts. (See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;3.;;">s 3 of Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>). The courts here are the supreme arbiter of what is right and wrong and are bound to decide a case based on the facts and law and the Constitution. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_362;"><i>Nik Noorhafizi Nik Ibrahim &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [2013] 6 MLRA 362</LINK>; [2013] 6 MLJ 660; [2014] 2 CLJ 273; [2013] 5 AMR 854, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_511;"><i>Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad v. PP</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 511</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 157; [2014] 4 CLJ 944 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_3_73;"><i>Teh Guat Hong v. Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional</i> [2015] 3 MLRA 73</LINK>; [2015] 3 AMR 35).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The concept of 'test' is much rigid and attempts to suggest judicial decision making process into science, though law falls into the category relating to Arts. For example, litmus test, blood test, urine test, etc are in fact scientific tests and upon application of specific formula and methodology, it will give results expected of the test. The same rigidity cannot be made applicable to doctors in the pretext of medical science in the field of diagnosis, treatment and advice to say it will give the expected result. In consequence, the court's supervision on conduct of doctors cannot be compromised by medical judgment that too when experts can be perceived to be partisan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Medical science is not a precise science and in consequence there are risks associated with the judgment of doctors, taking into consideration their years of experience, speciality, etc and the application of the practice and procedures; which need to be balanced with the essential services they provide for the stakeholders. As any other professionals, they too learn by trial and error and courts have taken cognisance of their plight. This point was well articulated by Lord Denning LJ in <i>Roe v. Ministry of Health (2)</i> [1954] 2 All ER 131 where His Lordship observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The above case will also show that the English courts have demonstrated that the principles of negligence related to medical negligence are not based on the same criteria as ordinary negligence cases. This distinction must be kept in mind to appreciate the distinction, approach and compromises case laws from time to time advance in relation to medical negligence jurisprudence. This point was well articulated in <i>Bolam</i>'s case by McNair J as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> What the courts do not condone is a job badly done, neglecting the interest of the patient. Justice Gopal Sri Ram in one of his articles, <i>The Standard of Care: Is The Bolam Principle Still The Law</i> [2000] 3 MLJ 1xxxi says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It is not correct for the appellant to argue that <i>Bolam</i>'s case has relevance only to diagnosis and treatment and not to medical advice <i>Bolam</i> principle applies to advice, diagnosis and treatment though the Malaysian position presently is that it does not apply to advice. This point is reflected in the judgment itself. McNair J on this issue observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The concept of 'guidelines' as opposed to test in the Malaysian context is more flexible and gives wider room for the court to apply the guidelines according to the facts of the case and come to a just decision with variations, if any as may be necessary, whether the judicial precedent relied on is from Malaysia or other jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In essence, whether it is <i>Bolam, Bolitho, Rogers v. Whitaker</i> or <i>Foo Fio Na</i> Test, it must be read as guidelines only and the courts are obliged to follow stringently the guidelines closely to arrive at a just decision on the facts of the case by doing a balancing exercise on the rights, obligation of the parties and circumstances of the case. No one 'test' or what we like to call as guidelines, may suit the facts of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> A useful guideline in medical negligence cases is always for the trial court to keep in mind the salutary words of Lord Denning in <i>Hucks v. Cole </i>[1993] 4 Med LR 393, where His Lordship asserted that to find liability against a doctor 'his conduct should be deserving of censure or inexcusable'. That is to say, the threshold for the plaintiffs to succeed is high in contrast to ordinary negligence cases. However, even though the threshold is high for the plaintiffs, once duty of care as well as standard of care has been breached and it is established against the doctor, case laws have placed the evidential burden on the doctor to rebut the plaintiffs' allegation when such allegation is supported by expert evidence to that the doctor has not satisfied the standard of care, expected of his professional standing. In <i>Bolam</i>'s case, Mc Nair J has suggested a guideline to determine if the doctor has breached the standard of care. His Lordship's guideline read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The facts of <i>Bolam</i>'s case as said earlier, not only related to diagnosis and treatment but also to medical advice. One of the articles published in the Malayan Law Journal on this point reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Cases and articles assert that <i>Bolam</i>'s case advocates 'Medical Judgment'. In <i>Sidaway v. Bethlem Royal Hospital Governor</i> [1985] AC 871, Lord Scarman opined:
</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> That is to say, the trial court is bound by the medical opinion and will not find the doctor negligent as long as there is a respectable body of medical opinion that supports his action. 'Medical Judgment' proposition impinges on the Malaysian court's role to adjudicate on the matter and in the context of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, opinion of experts is not meant to be the last say on the issue. Judicial supervision of the court on the conduct of any body or person cannot be curtailed by any judicial decision <i>per se</i> unless such protection is given to the class of person by the Federal Constitution. In addition, the patient being a layperson, ordinarily may not have the financial means and may also be at a disadvantage as he may have difficulty to bring 'respectable body of medical opinion' to match the doctor's expert evidence. In consequence, judicial supervision and determination will be of assistance to the patient in dealing with medical negligence cases, which is also part of our jurisprudence to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b>
      <i>Bolam</i>'s case in our view, does not in any way attempt to impinge on the role of the Malaysian court to decide on the issue of negligence independently after weighing experts' medical evidence. It is not totally correct to say 'the standard of care is a matter of medical judgment' in the Malaysian context. Further, under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, an expert view, in order to qualify as representative of a 'responsible body of medical opinion had to satisfy the threshold test of logic'. (See <i>Dr Khoo James &amp; Anor v. Gunapathy d/o Muniandy and Another Appeal</i> [2002] 2 SLR 414 (<i>Dr Khoo James</i>)). This proposition was well-articulated in the case of <i>Bolitho</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In <i>Dr Khoo Jame</i>'s case, the Singapore court on the issue of logic <i>inter alia</i> held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> A brief case analysis of leading cases relating to medical negligence will demonstrate that the courts were not setting out definitive test for medical negligence case, but in actual fact, were suggesting useful guidelines to reach a just conclusion, keeping in mind the traditional approach of the courts, only to find liability against doctors when it really warrants so.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The Hippocrates Oath written by Hippocrates is said to be one of the oldest documents in history and the terms of which are held sacred by doctors. The oath must be seen as the terms of engagement between doctors and patients and notice to the world. It will appear that the English courts may have kept the Hippocrates oath of engagement in mind when dealing with the 'standard of care' principles advocated in a conservative manner in <i>Bolam</i>'s case. That conservative guideline must be respected subject to other guidelines which are reasonably imposed by the courts from time to time which are not inimical to the said oath. The oath itself covers the 'standard of care' aspect. For example, it asserts. 'I will consider for the benefit of my patient and abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous' ... 'will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption'. And also the doctor undertakes 'I will follow the system of regiment which according to my ability of judgment'. The oath gives room for peer review as well as curial supervision on the conduct of doctors. The oath apparently does not cover the duty to inform the patient of the risk as advocated in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>'s case. The right to inform of the risk is one related to common sense and it arguably falls within the common law duty of care principle and medical opinion on the subject is irrelevant and in consequence the right to inform arguably ought not to be compartmentalised in the 'standard of care' concept.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b>
      <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle without being legislated arguably can be justified on the basis that the duty of care principle was always part of the common law principle and to discharge the said duty, the doctor is obliged to inform the patient of the diagnosis, treatment and risk, failing which if the patient suffers damage in relation to advice, diagnosis and treatment, the court may find the doctor liable within the parameters of established general principle of negligence though in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>, the court refused to accept advice in the caption of duty of care.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> If the issue is whether the patient has a right to be informed, then it is arguably related to the duty of care principle. The answer is one related to common sense and medical opinion is not a criteria to determine the issue. However, if it extends to the nature of information and the exposure of the risk to the patient as well as the advice is correct, then it is related to standard of care as advocated by case laws though the distinction between the two has not been clearly made out. The standard of care issue which adds on to the liability of the doctors in Malaysia as advocated in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> must arguably be legislated within our jurisprudence, if it is to be made as a strict test as opposed to guidelines. It must also be noted in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>, the court refused to separate the duty of care and the standard of care issue, and the court asserted at p 489 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The standard of care issue as to advice, in our view, taking the principles enunciated in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case, must be decided on the basis whether the doctor had acted reasonably and logically and have got the facts correct. Such an approach is harmonious with the principles of negligence as well as the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. In this respect the dissenting opinion of Lord Scarman in <i>Sidaway</i>'s case will fit the equation. In the instant case, His Lordship observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> From the Grounds of Judgment of <i>Bolam</i>, the practice of informing the patient of the risk was already in vogue in medical practice. There were also circumstances in which it could be considered that it would not be beneficial to tell a patient of <b>possible</b> dangers and mishaps. However, in <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>, the court took the view that <b>probable</b> risks ought to be disclosed [Emphasis Added]. In <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>, it was held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The Federal Court in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case did not say in any positive terms that the <i>Bolam, Bolitho</i> or <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principles will apply in all cases of medical negligence in Malaysia. In our view, the <i>Bolam, Bolitho</i> and <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principles may apply as guiding principles in medical negligence cases in Malaysia, depending on the issues and facts and the rider the Federal Court has placed. The three cases were discussed at length by the Federal Court but the question posed to the Federal Court was not whether <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>'s case should be applicable to all cases of medical negligence in Malaysia. Much confusion arises at times in consequence of jurists attempting to read the case out of context.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case, the High Court allowed the plaintiff's claim in medical negligence. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the court set aside the judgment of the High Court primarily based on procedural fairness as well as the failure of the plaintiff to establish the case according to law. All things being equal on the facts of the case, the plaintiff ought to have succeeded. The Court of Appeal's grounds in the judgment were substantially related to errors committed by the trial judge as well as the plaintiff's counsel. The Court of Appeal's judgment was not based on the fact that the plaintiff did not have a good case to succeed. The <i>Bolam, Bolitho</i> or <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principles were not substantially used by the Court of Appeal to demolish the trial court judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> To appeal to the Federal Court, the plaintiff need to obtain leave. In matters of leave, the Federal Court on established principles is not concerned to whether there was in fact a miscarriage of justice in the Court of Appeal's decision, refusing to entertain a viable claim of the plaintiff. The principle to grant leave is strict in law and has nothing to do with justice, equity or good conscience and is set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96 Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. The said section reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In granting leave, the Federal Court consisting of Steve LK Shim CJSS, Abdul Malek Ahmad FCJ and Mokhtar Abdullah FCJ confined the question of law to the particular aspect of medical negligence that relates more specifically to the duty and standard of care of a medical practitioner in providing advice to a patient on the inherent or material risks of the proposed treatment. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_763;"><i>Foo Fio Na v. Dr Soo Fook Mun &amp; Anor</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 763</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 129; [2002] 2 CLJ 11; [2002] 2 AMR 1524). The leave was granted to consider the development of law in Australian cases. The nature of the application for leave and the grounds were described by the Federal Court as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The leave granted was related to medical advice which impliedly refers to <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>'s case. It must be noted that the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case which rested on technicalities, totally rejected <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle and fully endorsed the <i>Bolam</i> principle. The Court of Appeal in rejecting <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In any event, the question of law posed to the Federal Court after obtaining leave was stated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The leave will appear to be related to <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle relating to advice. The question of law posed to the Federal Court relates to the <i>Bolam</i> principle ignoring the <i>
Bolitho</i> principle. In any event, the Federal Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The decision of the Federal court only answers a question posed, ie whether the <i>Bolam</i> principle should apply to all aspects of medical negligence. The question itself ignores <i>Bolitho</i>'s principle, etc. In answering the question posed, the Federal Court has rightly ruled in the negative. The negative ruling was applied to the facts of <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case. In consequence, the proposition of the Court of Appeal advocating the <i>Bolam</i> principle would have been a misdirection of law and the only other issue which would have remained to be decided is whether or not the technical issues relied on by the Court of Appeal is sufficient to set aside the High Court's decision which decided the case on merits, taking into consideration <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;60.;;">s 60 of Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The Federal Court allowed the appeal and affirmed the order of the High Court in respect of quantum, meaning to say the Court of Appeal's decision was set aside. The Federal Court's order at para 79 in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The Federal Court in <i>Foo Fio Na</i> allowed the appeal, and it did not agree to the <i>Bolam</i> principle as advocated by the Court of Appeal. The Federal Court did not reject the <i>Bolam</i> principle or <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle <i>in toto</i> but added a rider, ie to say that the court ultimately must determine whether the doctor had acted reasonably and logically and got his facts right. In consequence <i>inter alia</i> of the rider, medical negligence cases in Malaysia cannot be decided by medical judgment, but it has to be by way of judicial determination. The Federal Court also had made it clear that the <i>Bolam</i> principle will not apply to advice, but <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle will.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The Federal Court in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case dealt in great detail, the guidelines which originate from <i>Bolam, Bolitho</i> and <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>. A summary of the facts of case will be useful to appreciate the Federal Court's decision in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The plaintiff in <i>Foo Fio Na</i> met with an accident and <i>inter alia</i> had severe injuries in the spine which resulted in closed dislocation of C4 and C5 vertebrae with bilaterally locked facets. Conservative treatment was not successful and the defendant doctor performed two operations. Before the first operation, a standard consent form was signed by the patient. After the first operation, the plaintiff was paralysed. It was subsequently discovered by one neurosurgeon that the wire loop which was placed to correct the dislocation of C4 and C5 was pressuring the spinal cord and that was the cause of total paralysis. In consequence, the doctor immediately performed the second operation but it did not remove the paralysis in full and the patient was confined to the wheelchair. The doctor had also obtained consent for the second operation but the consent form only had thumbprint of the plaintiff and not her signature. There was a complaint that the doctor did not give proper medical advice. On the issue of consent and risk, the Federal Court made the following observation:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> On the issue of advice, the Federal Court at para 39 held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The above paragraph of the judgment makes it clear that the <i>Bolam</i> principle is not to be the preferred guideline when it relates to advice. The Federal Court also acknowledged that case laws on this point are not consistent in English courts. At paras 40-41 the court observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The Federal Court at para 50 also had confirmed that the <i>Bolam</i> principle was not followed in Australia in respect of medical advice and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The Federal Court also confirmed that the <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle was applied in a number of cases in Malaysia. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1999_3_359;"><i>Foo Fio Na v. Hospital Assunta &amp; Anor</i> [1999] 3 MLRH 359</LINK>; [1999] 6 MLJ 738; [1999] 8 CLJ 184, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_134;"><i>Dr Soo Fook Mun v.

    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The Federal Court in reliance on a book on <i>medical negligence</i> by Michael Jones (1996) observed as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> At para 78 the Federal Court asserted that the <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle would be more appropriate and viable in contrast to the <i>Bolam</i> Test. This paragraph must not be taken out of context as the Federal Court's decision discusses in length that the <i>Bolam</i> principle is not appropriate to advice but <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle is. Paragraph 78 of the judgment, reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> In essence, the Federal Court's decision in <i>Foo Fio Na</i>'s case is clear that the guidelines for advice will not be predicated on the principle laid down in <i>Bolam</i>'s case and the preferred principles is related to <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>'s case. However, whether the <i>Bolam</i> or <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i> principle is applicable, the overriding consideration for the courts is not to compromise its pedestal and its role on finding of facts as well as law, and not to find the doctor liable if he had acted reasonably and logically and got his facts right, a proposition which was not anchored in <i>Bolam</i> or <i>Bolitho</i> or <i>Rogers v. Whitaker</i>'s case. The Federal Court case of <i>Foo Fio Na</i> does not compromise the patient's right or doctor's role and maintains the 'relevant standard', taking into consideration the rider as well as a higher threshold for the patient to satisfy to find liability against doctors when it relates to diagnosis and treatment and a lower threshold to satisfy when it relates to medical advice. The difference is like an apple and orange and in scientific sense, both the principles cannot be married together. When it relates to diagnosis and treatment, the <i>Bolam</i> principle is a factor to be considered, taking into consideration the <i>Bolitho</i>'s principle and ensuring the doctor is not found liable when he had acted reasonably and logically and got his facts correct.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We have read the appeal record and the able submissions of the counsel. After much consideration to the submission of the respondents, we take the view that the appeal must be allowed and the cross-appeal of the respondents must be dismissed.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> For reasons stated above the appeal is allowed with costs and the cross-appeal on quantum is dismissed. The judgment of the High Court is set aside. We will hear the parties on costs before fixing the amount.</p>
