    <p>The appellant was employed as a General Manager, Services, of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent ('respondent') since 8 March 2004. Her duties as General Manager, Services, included being in charge of the Services Department, the Human Resource Department, the Administration Department and the Property and Maintenance Department. On 21 June 2011, due to a restructuring exercise in the respondent's organisation, the Services Department was abolished and the Human Resources Department taken away from the appellant's charge and placed under the care of another officer. The appellant was made to assume a junior management position, reporting three tiers down the management line compared to her previous direct reporting to the CEO. Due to the restructuring, the appellant was only to be in charge of the Administration and Property and Maintenance Departments. Aggrieved by the restructuring, the appellant by letter dated 1 August 2011 submitted her resignation letter to the respondent on the grounds of constructive dismissal. The respondent denied any wrongdoing through a written reply and requested the appellant to return to work. The appellant refused to do so and instead took her grievances to the Industrial Relations office, which facilitated reconciliation meetings where at one of those meetings, the respondent made an offer of reinstatement and offered the appellant back the position of General Manager, Services. However, contrary to the appellant's expectations, the Human Resource Department remained out of her charge. The appellant was only to be in charge of the Administration Department and the Property and Maintenance Departments. The appellant rejected the offer of reinstatement since the Human Resource Department was not restored to her charge. The appellant filed representations with the Director General of Industrial Relations under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;20.;;">s 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK> ("the Act"), who pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;20.;;">s 20(2) of the Act</LINK> notified the Minister of the representations. The Minister, acting under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;20.;;">s 20(3) of the Act</LINK> referred the matter to the Industrial Court. The respondent applied to the High Court and obtained a writ of certiorari to quash the Minister's decision to refer the matter to the Industrial Court. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. At the appeal, the respondent took the position that where an offer of reinstatement had been offered by the employer at the conciliation stage before the Director General of Industrial Relations, but was declined by the employee, the Minister would then have no jurisdiction to refer the matter to the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondent had correctly stated the law that where the employer had made an offer of reinstatement at the conciliation stage before the Director General of Industrial Relations, but where the employee declined the offer, the Minister has no jurisdiction to refer the matter to the Industrial Court. However, this principle would only apply where there had been a genuine offer of reinstatement. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The offer for "reinstatement" in the respondent's letter of 26 September 2011 did not place the active Human Resource Department under the appellant. Thus, it was not a genuine offer of reinstatement. If indeed it was a genuine offer of reinstatement, then, the offer of reinstatement should be to restore the appellant to her former position, that is General Manager, Services with the Human Resources Department being put back under her charge. Without restoring the Human Resources Department, the importance and prestige of the appellant's post and her responsibilities had been substantially diminished. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the Minister had considered the facts and documents fairly in making his decision to refer the representation to the Industrial Court. The Minister in his affidavit had considered the complaint that the appellant, in the purported reinstatement, would cease to be in charge of the Human Resource Department resulting in the diminishing of her responsibilities as well the importance and prestige of the post.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court of Kuala Lumpur (Appellate and Special Powers Division) of 6 December 2012 granting the issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Minister of Human Resource ('the Minister') to refer the appellant's representation to the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant's representation to the Director General of Industrial Relations was made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;20.;;">s 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967</LINK> ('the Act'). In her representation, the appellant had sought reinstatement to her former employment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The Director General, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;20.;;">s 20(2) of the Act</LINK>, had notified the Minister of the representation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The reference by the Minister of Human Resource to the Industrial Court, in regard to the appellant's representation, was made in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;20.;;">s 20(3) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> For convenience, we set out here the relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;20.;;">s 20 of the Act</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The application to the High Court for judicial review to quash the Minister's decision (to refer the representation to the Industrial Court) was made by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent (AmLife Insurance Berhad), the appellant's former employer (hereinafter, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent shall be referred to as 'the respondent').</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Minister is not challenging the decision of the High Court to quash his decision. It is only the appellant who is appealing to this court against the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant was employed as a General Manager, Services, of the respondent company since 8 March 2004. She was confirmed in her appointment with effect from 4 October 2004. As the General Manager, Services, the Services Department, which includes, among others, the important Human Resource Department came under her charge, and also the Administration Department and Property and Maintenance Department.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In the letter of offer of employment it is laid down that she reported directly to the Chief Executive Officer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> However, on 21 June 2011 there was a restructuring exercise in the respondent's organisation. By this exercise the Services Department was abolished and the Human Resource Department was taken away from the appellant's charge and placed under the care of another officer. The appellant was made to assume a junior management position, reporting three tiers down the management line in contrast to the original direct reporting to the CEO. She was now to be in charge of only the Administration Department and Property and Maintenance Department.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Aggrieved by the exercise, the appellant, by a letter dated 1 August 2011 submitted to the respondent alleging constructive dismissal. The relevant portion of her letter states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The respondent by its letter of 3 August 2011 denied any wrongdoing, and requested the appellant to report back to work on or before 11 August 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant refused to return to work. She, instead, by a letter dated 10 August 2011, informed the respondent:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> At a reconciliation meeting on 28 September 2011, the respondent by letter dated 26 September 2011, made an offer of reinstatement. Vide this offer of reinstatement, the appellant was offered back the position of General Manager, Services. However, contrary to the appellant's expectation, the Human Resource Department remained out of her care. She would only be in charge of Administration Department and Property and Maintenance Department.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The letter reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The appellant rejected the offer of reinstatement since the Human Resource Department was not restored to her charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondent's Basis In Seeking To Quash The Minister's Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The respondent's basis in seeking to quash the decision of the Minister is as follows (we quote para 17(a) of Part B of the written submission by learned counsel for the respondent):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We also refer to the position taken by the learned counsel for the respondent on the applicable principle of law (see para 4 of Part E of the written submission of learned counsel for the respondent):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The respondent relied, among others, on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1996_1_142;"><i>Hong Leong Equipment Sdn Bhd v. Liew Fook Chuan &amp; Other Appeals</i> [1996] 1 MELR 142</LINK>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_212;">[1996] 2 MLRA 212</LINK> where Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of Court of Appeal said (at p 233):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We accept that the respondent has correctly stated the law that where an offer of reinstatement had been offered by the employer at the conciliation stage before the Director General of Industrial Relations, but the offer was declined by the employee, the Minister has no jurisdiction to refer the matter to the Industrial Court. We would add that this principle only applies where there has been a genuine offer of reinstatement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Issue For Consideration</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Thus, in the present case, on the facts, had there been a genuine offer of reinstatement to the appellant by the respondent?</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The judicial review application to quash the Minister's decision was allowed by the High Court principally on the ground that the Minister had no jurisdiction to refer the representation to the Industrial Court since there had been an offer of reinstatement by the respondent but the appellant had refused to accept it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We are allowing the appeal with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We agree with the submission of the leaned counsel for the appellant that the offer for 'reinstatement' in the respondent's letter of 26 September 2011 did not place the active Human Resource Department under the appellant. This being the case, it is argued that it was not a genuine offer of reinstatement. There is merit in this argument. In our judgment, if, indeed, it was a genuine offer of reinstatement, then, the offer of reinstatement should be to restore the appellant to her former position, that is, General Manager (Services) with the Human Resources Department being put back under her charge. For, without restoring the Human Resources Department, the importance and prestige of the appellant's post and her responsibilities had been substantially diminished. We accept the appellant's contention that, notwithstanding the fact that she was offered back the post of 'General Manager, Services', since the Human Resources Department had been taken away from her charge, there was actually no reinstatement in the true sense.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We accept the appellant's submission that in the present case the Minister had considered the facts and documents fairly in making his decision to refer the representation to the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The Minister in his affidavit had considered the complaint that the appellant, in the purported reinstatement, would cease to be in charge of the Human Resource Department resulting in diminishing of her responsibilities as well as the importance and prestige of the post. Para 7.2 of his affidavit states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Accordingly, we set aside the Order of the High Court and restore the decision of the Minister to refer the representation to the Industrial Court.</p>
    <p>
      <i>[Appeal allowed with costs. Order of the High Court set aside. The decision of the Minister restored.]</i>
    </p>
