      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>There were two appeals against the Court of Appeal's decision as a result of the defendants' appeal from the High Court's decision, which was in favor of the plaintiffs. The 1st appeal by the defendants was on the question whether the evidence of the Registrar of Trade Marks ('Registrar') was material to prove trade mark infringement whilst the 2nd appeal by the plaintiffs was on whether it was a pre-requisite to name the Registrar as a party in an application to expunge or rectify the Register of Trade Marks ('Register'). The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants infringed their trade mark on a product called Viartril-S, a glucosamine sulphate drug used for the treatment of osteoarthritis. It was alleged the defendants' product called Artril-250 was similar to and bore a colourable deceptive imitation to the plaintiffs' Viartril-S. The High Court allowed the plaintiffs' claim on infringement and passing off, and ordered the defendants' Artril-250 mark to be expunged from the Register. The Court of Appeal allowed the defendants' appeal in part by setting aside the plaintiffs' infringement and expungement claims but allowing their passing off claim. The Court of Appeal was of the view that the expungement could not be ordered without hearing evidence from the Registrar of Trade Marks on why he had allowed the registration in the first place. Reference was made to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62 of the Trade Marks Act 1976 ('Act')</LINK>. Hence, both parties now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the first appeal by the defendants and allowing the second appeal by the plaintiffs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> On the issue whether the defendants should be allowed to argue and challenge the findings of fact made by the learned judge on infringement and passing off, this court did not think it should be allowed. The Court of Appeal had affirmed the learned judge's findings of fact on those issues. The defendants' submissions on them sought to reverse the findings of fact with consequential orders, which would amount to a complete re-hearing of the appeal and a complete disregard of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. The questions before this court were couched to incorporate a point of law which if answered in the affirmative or negative had the effect of reversing the conclusions made by the Court of Appeal without any further evaluation of the evidence. It was the answers to those questions that must have the effect of reversing the conclusions made by the Court of Appeal and not the result of a review of the concurrent findings of fact made earlier on. The questions must also relate to a matter in respect of which the Court of Appeal had made a determination. Therefore, the defendants should only be allowed to confine their arguments on the two questions of law posed before this court. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> There was no necessity to bring in the Registrar as a party to the suit where there was no cause of action against the Registrar. The Registrar had the right to appear if he deemed fit or if the court required his assistance in the determination of issues relating to his scope of functions and duties. There were no statutory provisions requiring the Registrar to be made a party to rectification and expungement proceedings under the Act. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">Section 45 of the Act</LINK> was silent on that matter. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The court or the Registrar had no discretion to allow a mark wrongfully registered to continue to remain on the Register. Once the grounds for revocation or removal of a mark were made out, the mark must be removed or expunged from the Register. It was not the duty of the Registrar to refer any matter to the court. If there was a dispute as to identical marks, it was for the registered proprietor or owner of the aggrieved mark to bring an action in court to resolve the dispute. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The remedy of removal or expungement of a trade mark from the Register was not dependent on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62(1) of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">Section 62(1)</LINK> accorded the right to the court to call the Registrar if the court so required his assistance and further gave the Registrar a right to appear if he wished to do so. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">Section 62(2)</LINK> further provided that unless otherwise directed by the court, the Registrar, <i>in lieu</i> of appearing and being heard, might submit to the court a statement in writing signed by him and such statement should be deemed to form part of the evidence in court. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">Section 62</LINK> clearly could not be read to mean that the Registrar ought to be made a party to the action. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> It was a rebuttable presumption that a mark, once registered by the Register, was <i>prima facie</i> a valid trade mark. Once evidence was shown that the Registered mark was invalid and should not have been registered in the first place the natural remedy would be to remove the invalid mark from the register. Registration was not a defense in relation to marks wrongfully entered in the Register. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The Court of Appeal's decision that the Registrar should be made a party or heard in evidence before a rectification could be made did not accord with the statutory provisions under the Act or its Regulations. Such an approach adopted by the Court of Appeal would place the Registrar in an invidious position of participating in the proceedings in favor of one side or the other, and would destroy the neutrality of his office. Further, even if the Registrar gave evidence, the determination of whether there was likelihood of confusion still lay with the court. The question of whether there was a real likelihood of deception of the public was ultimately one for the court to decide. (paras 28-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The Court of Appeal, although agreeing with the High Court on deception and that the defendants' mark was confusingly similar to the plaintiffs' mark, withheld sanctioning the expungement of the offending mark due to an over-reliance on the decision in the English case of the <i>PHANTOM Trade Mark</i>. The Court of Appeal had misconstrued that decision and applied it more widely than warranted. That decision was confined to its facts and not intended to lay down any general proposition with regard to the role of the Registrar in expungement proceedings. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The Court of Appeal erred in relying on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK> to suggest wrongful exercise of discretion by the High Court and disagreeing with its previous decision in <i>Sinma Medical Products (M) Sdn Bhd v. Yomeishu Seizo Co Ltd &amp; Ors</i> on the application of the said section. The Court of Appeal instead held it as a further ground on which the Registrar should be heard. Although <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)</LINK> began with the word "notwithstanding ...", it was a general principle that a non-obstante clause could not go outside the limits of the Act itself. The non-obstante clause was subject to the limitations contained in the section and could not be read as excluding the whole Act and standing by itself. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">Section 40(1)(f)</LINK> only applied to a right to use a mark duly registered under the Act. It was subject to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;35.;;">s 35(1)</LINK> governing the rights given by registration and also subject to other provisions of the Act. The defendants could use the registered trade mark only if validly registered. If it were otherwise, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f)</LINK> could override registration of marks obtained by fraud under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;37.;;">s 37(a)</LINK> or trade marks obtained contrary to law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;14.;;">s 14(1)(a)</LINK> and thus provide a valid defence thereof. That could not be the intention of the legislature. Sinma's case rightly held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f)</LINK> did not afford a defence in relation to marks wrongfully entered on the Register.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin CJM:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> These are two appeal cases before this court. We heard them jointly. In the first case Civil Appeal No: 02-7-03-2013(W) the appellants are the defendants and in the second case Civil Appeal No: 02-13-04-2013(W) the appellants are the plaintiffs before the High Court. We shall refer to the parties as there were before the High Court. The appellants in both cases have obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal. On 11 February 2014 the Federal Court allowed the application by the Registrar of Trade Marks ["the Registrar"] to intervene in these two appeals. The two questions of law posed to us in respect of the two appeals are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The first question is posed by the defendants in the 1st appeal and the second question is posed by the plaintiffs in the 2nd appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The relevant background facts of the case may be summarized as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The plaintiffs filed the suit against the defendants and claimed <i>inter alia</i>, for declaratory reliefs, injunctions and the name "Advance Pharma" be removed from the Registry of Companies. After a full trial, the High Court held that the plaintiffs had proven their case on a balance of probabilities against the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th defendants and accordingly entered judgment against these defendants together with interests and costs. However, the High Court dismissed the plaintiffs' claim against the 4th defendant. The third party's claim against the 2nd defendant by the 4th defendant was also struck off with no order as to costs. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs was also dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In his judgment, the learned judge of the High Court found that there was a confusing similarity between Viartril-S mark and the Atril-250 mark after comparing them phonetically and visually. Based on such finding of facts, the learned judge held that there was passing off by the defendants of the plaintiffs' product as the plaintiffs had successfully established the necessary criteria for passing off in relation to the plaintiffs' goodwill and reputation in the trade mark. There was also misrepresentation by the defendants and consequential to that the plaintiffs had suffered damage to its goodwill and reputation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The learned judge also found that the 1st and 2nd defendants were not credible witnesses and based on the evidence during the trial, the judge held that the 1st and 2nd defendants had breached their obligation of confidentiality. Further, the judge found that there was unauthorized use of confidential information by the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The Court of Appeal affirmed the orders of the High Court save and except to set aside the prayers contained in paras (k), (l) and (m) of the orders of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the learned judge of the High Court based on his findings of facts. However, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the learned judge when he exercised his discretion and allowed the plaintiffs' claim to expunge an existing trade mark registered by the defendants. The Court of Appeal was of the view that the defendants' product was registrable as a trade mark under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;10.;;">s 10 of the Act</LINK>. The Act does not prohibit the registration of two or more trade marks which are identical or so nearly resembling each other.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Court of Appeal made reference to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;19.;;">s 19(3) of the Act</LINK> and held that it was the discretion of the Registrar to refuse registration. Since the Registrar proceeded with the registration, the registration was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the validity of the defendants' trade mark. The Court of Appeal also observed that the plaintiffs took no steps under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;28.;;">s 28 of the Act</LINK> to oppose the registration. Further, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the High Court ought to have received the evidence of the Registrar before exercising his discretion to order the expungement of the defendants' trade mark based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions Of The Defendants</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b>Learned counsel for the respective defendants submitted that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;4.;;">s 4 of the Act</LINK> the power to superintend all matters relating to trade marks is vested with the Registrar. The principal functions of the Registrar as provided for under the Act and its Regulations include giving preliminary advice to a person who proposes to apply for the registration of a trade mark. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;73.;;">Section 73(1) of the Act</LINK> provides as follows.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1997_460;26.;;">Regulation 26 of the Trade Marks Regulations 1997</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It was the defendants' contention that in an application for the registration of a trade mark, the onus of proving that the mark is not calculated to deceive or cause confusion lies on the applicant. [See <i>In the matter of Dunn's Trade Mark</i> [1890] 7 RPC 311]. In the instant case it was contended that the 3rd defendant had discharged that burden of proof. It was not disputed by the plaintiffs that the application to register "Atril-250" as a trade mark was approved after the commencement of the suit. The successful registration of "Atril-250" evinced that the mark was not deceptively similar or likely to cause confusion when compared with the 1st plaintiff 's mark "Viatril-S".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was further contended for the defendants that the Registrar is entitled to be heard in any legal proceedings relating to the trade marks registered on the Trade Marks Register ["the Register"]. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">Section 62 of the Act</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It was submitted for the defendants that the plaintiffs' failure to call the Registrar to give evidence during the trial was fatal to the plaintiffs' case. This is because the power of the court to rectify or alter the Register is subject to the provisions of the Act. Thus, the right of the Registrar to be heard must be read into it. The Registrar is a key witness in the instant case, in particular, having regard the fact that his decision to allow the registration of "Atril-250" as a trade mark was made after the commencement of the suit. The plaintiffs' claim on passing off should not succeed. It depended on the proof of likelihood of confusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It was the defendants' case that by not calling the Registrar to give evidence at the trial of the suit, the plaintiffs must be taken to have admitted or conceded to the decision of the Registrar in approving the registration of "Atril-250" as a trade mark. A proposed trade mark cannot be registered unless it contains or consists of at least one of the particulars set out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;10.;;">s 10(1) of the Act</LINK> which provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Learned counsel for the defendants also made an attempt before us to challenge the findings of facts. They were made by the trial judge and affirmed by the Court of Appeal. They were in respect of the infringement of the plaintiffs' trade mark and the passing off by the defendants of the plaintiffs' product. It was impressed upon us to exercise our appellate powers to interfere with the findings of the trial judge on the ground that there had been non-consideration or insufficient judicial appreciation of material evidence and that the findings of the trial judge did not accord well with the probabilities of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions Of The Plaintiffs</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In reply, learned counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there is no need to bring the Registrar as a party to the suit when there is no cause of action against the Registrar. The Registrar has a right to appear if he deems fit or if the court requires his assistance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> It was contended for the plaintiffs that the court has the power to expunge any mark that has been wrongfully registered or wrongly remaining on the Register. Once the grounds for revocation or removal of a mark have been made out, the mark must be removed or expunged from the Register.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> For the plaintiffs it was also argued that it is not for the Registrar to refer any matter to the court. If there is a dispute as to identical marks, then it is for the registered proprietor or owner of the aggrieved mark to bring an action in court to resolve such dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The Court of Appeal made a finding that if the Registrar has allowed the registration of two marks that are substantially identical, it then affords a defense to the subsequent registered mark (concurrent marks). On this point it was the plaintiffs' contention that this is only a defense if the concurrent mark was properly registered in the first place. Registration is not a defense in relation to marks that have been wrongfully entered on to the Register. It is the plaintiffs' case that a mark which is likely to deceive or cause confusion is a mark that should never have been and ought not to be registered in the first place. Once this finding has been made that mark ought to be removed or expunged from the Register.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> As regards the defendants' attempt to be allowed to challenge the findings of fact made by the trial judge in respect of the infringement of the plaintiffs' trade mark and the passing off by the defendants of the plaintiffs' product, learned counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that this court should not allow the defendants to do so. The parties should only confine their argument to the two questions of law posed before this court. Moreover it was impressed upon us that there were concurrent findings on those issues by the High Court and by the Court of Appeal. The findings of the trial judge on those issues were made after a first hand evaluation of the evidence of all the witnesses and other evidence related to the case. Therefore such findings should not be interfered with by an appellate court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions Of The Intervener</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Learned counsel for the Registrar submitted before us that he was adopting and supporting the arguments advanced by the plaintiffs. The Registrar took the position that there was no duty or obligation for the Registrar to appear in any proceeding brought by any aggrieved party. The role of the Registrar is administrative and quasi-judicial in nature. Learned counsel also submitted that the Registrar is now before this court as the Intervener merely to clarify and state its stand in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in ruling that the High Court ought to have received the evidence of the Registrar before exercising his discretion to order the expungment of the defendants' trade mark based on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> At the outset we shall deal with the submissions of learned counsel for the defendants that the defendants be allowed to argue and challenge on the findings of fact made by the trial judge in respect of the infringement of the plaintiffs' trade mark and the passing off by the defendants of the plaintiffs' product. With respect we do not think it should be allowed. The High Court made findings of facts on those issues and affirmed by the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The submissions advanced by learned counsel for the defendants in support of those issues are in effect seeking a reversal of the findings of facts in this case on the infringement of the trade mark by the defendants with the resultant consequential orders. In our view this would result in a complete re-hearing of the appeal on those issues and would be a complete disregard to the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;96.;;">s 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> when leave to appeal to this court was granted. The two questions posed before this court when leave was granted have been couched to incorporate a point of law which if answered in the affirmative or negative have the effect of reversing the conclusions made by the Court of Appeal without any further evaluation of the evidence. It is the answers to those questions which must have the effect of reversing the conclusions made by the Court of Appeal and not the result of a review of the concurrent findings of facts made earlier on. The questions posed must also relate to a matter in respect of which a determination has been made by the Court of Appeal. [See the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_80;"><i>Meidi-Ya Co Ltd, Japan &amp; Anor v. Meidi (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 80</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 14; [2009] 2 CLJ 15]. We therefore rule that the defendants should only be allowed to confine their arguments on the two questions of law posed before this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We shall now deal with the two questions of law posed before this court. The present two appeals raised the issue of the proper role of the Registrar in rectification and expungement proceedings under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45 of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">Section 45 of the Act</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We are of the view there is no necessity to bring in the Registrar as a party to the suit where there is no cause of action against the Registrar. The Registrar has the right to appear if he deems fit or if the court requires his assistance in the determination of issues before the court relating to his scope of functions and duties. There are no statutory provisions which require the Registrar to be made a party to a rectification and expungement proceedings under the Act. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">Section 45 of the Act</LINK> is silent on this.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We are of the view that neither the court nor the Registrar has the discretion to allow a mark that has been wrongfully registered to continue to remain on the Register. Once the grounds for revocation or removal of a mark have been made out, the mark must be removed or expunged from the Register. It is not the duty of the Registrar to refer any matter to the court. If there is a dispute as to identical marks, then it is for the registered proprietor or owner of the aggrieved mark to bring an action in court to resolve the dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The defendants relied heavily on the Court of Appeal's decision that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62(1) of the Act</LINK> the Registrar should have been made a party or at the very least summoned to give evidence to the court. With respect, we are of the view the remedy of removal or expungement of a trade mark from the Register is not dependent on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62(1) of the Act</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">Section 62(1) of the Act</LINK> accords the right to the court to call the Registrar if the court so requires his assistance and further gives the Registrar a right to appear if he wishes to do so. It should also be noted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62(2) of the Act</LINK> further provides that unless otherwise directed by the court, the Registrar, <i>in lieu</i> of appearing and being heard, may submit to the court a statement in writing signed by him and such statement shall be deemed to form part of the evidence in court. On this point reference can be made to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_1_126;"><i>Godrej Sara Lee Ltd v. Siah Teong Teck &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 1 MLRH 126</LINK>; [2007] 7 MLJ 153; [2007] 10 CLJ 255 wherein Ramly Ali J (as he then was) expressed the view that this provision allows the Registrar to appear in court if the Registrar chooses to do so and he shall appear if the court so directs him. The learned judge was also of the view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62(2) of the Act</LINK> further illustrates that the Registrar's appearance in court is merely to assist the court whenever such assistance is required. Therefore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62 of the Act</LINK> clearly cannot be read to mean that the Registrar ought to be made a party to the action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> On the contention of the defendants and in support of the findings of the Court of Appeal that once a mark is registered by the Registrar, it is <i>prima facie</i> a valid trade mark, we are of the view that this is a rebuttable presumption. Once evidence is shown that the registered mark is invalid and should not have been registered in the first place the natural remedy would be to remove the invalid mark from the Register. Registration is therefore not a defense in relation to marks that have been wrongfully entered onto the Register. On this point we would refer to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2005_1_172;"><i>Industria de Diseno Textil SA v. Edition Concept Sdn Bhd</i> [2005] 1 MLRH 172</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 347; [2005] 2 CLJ 357; [2005] 2 AMR 698 where it was held that even where a trademark has been properly registered, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;45.;;">s 45(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> empowers the court to expunge or vary such a trade mark in the event that it becomes confusing as a result of events subsequent to the initial registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We are of the view that the decision of the Court of Appeal to hold that the Registrar should be made a party or heard in evidence before a rectification could be made, was not, with respect, in accord with the statutory provisions under the Act or its Regulations. Such an approach adopted by the Court of Appeal would place the Registrar in an invidious position of participating in the proceedings in favor of one side or the other, and would destroy the neutrality of his office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Further, we are of the view that even if the Registrar gives evidence, the determination of whether there is likelihood of confusion still lies with the court. The question of whether there is a real likelihood of deception of the public is ultimately one for the court to decide as aptly put by Lord Hodson in the case of <i>Parker-Knoll Limited v. Knoll International Limited</i> [1962] RPC 265 at p 285 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It is to be noted that the position as regards the Registrar's participation in the infringement of trade marks proceedings is the same as in the United Kingdom ["UK"], Australia and India where there are trade mark legislations similar to ours. A reference to <i>Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</i>, 12th edn, at p 207 shows that in UK under s 50(1) of the English Trade Marks Act 1938 [which is in <i>pari materia</i> with<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;"> s 62(1) of the Act</LINK>] the Registrar's attendance in court is not necessary unless so ordered by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In <i>Bacardi</i> [1965] RPC 28, the applicant for rectification proceedings asked that pursuant to s 50(1) of the English Trade Marks Act 1938, the Registrar should be directed to appear so that they could obtain discovery against him to ascertain who had induced the Registrar to make alterations to the Register. The English High Court held that the Registrar should enter appearance. The Registrar appeared to give discovery but stated through the Treasury Solicitor that it was not the normal practice of the Registrar to appear in proceedings in which the issue was a dispute between two parties as to proprietorship of a trade mark. It was held that the Registrar's appearance was necessary as the Registrar's evidence was crucial in determining who made the application to change the address and assign the trade marks to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In Australia, s 22(5) of the Australian Trade Marks Act 1955 provides that in rectification proceedings, a notice of the application must be given to the Registrar who may appear and be heard and must appear if so directed by the court. There is no statutory requirement for the Registrar to be made a party to the proceedings. The High Court of Australia in the case of <i>The Shell Company of Australia Limited v. Rohm &amp; Haas Company &amp; Anor</i> [1949] 78 CLR 601 unanimously held that the Registrar should not be made a party to an application for rectification but notice of such application should be given to him under s 71(3) of the Australian Trade Marks Act 1955.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In India, in interpreting s 112 of the Indian Trade Marks Act 1958 (which is in pari materia with our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;62.;;">s 62(1) of the Act</LINK>), the Indian High Court in <i>Chandra Bhan Agarwal &amp; Anor v. Arjundas Agarwal &amp; Others</i> [1979] AIR Calcutta 280, <i>inter alia</i> stated that the Registrar had the right to appear and be heard in any legal proceeding before the High Court in which the relief sought for included alteration or rectification of the Register. The Indian High Court went on to say that it was however not essential that the Registrar should be made a party to the proceedings and it would be sufficient compliance with the section if he was given the requisite notice and opportunity to appear before the court and present his case if so advised.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In this first appeal although the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court on deception and that the defendants' mark was confusingly similar to the plaintiffs' mark, it withheld sanctioning the expungement of the offending mark. It is our judgment that the Court of Appeal came to this erroneous finding due to an over-reliance on the decision in the case of the <i>PHANTOM Trade Mark</i> case [1978] RPC 245. The Court of Appeal had misconstrued that decision and applied it more widely than it warranted. That decision was confined to its facts and not intended to lay down any general proposition with regard to the role of the Registrar in expungement proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> It is also noted on its facts that the case of the <i>PHANTOM Trade Mark</i> was concerned with the previous assignment of a registered trade mark. The law in England had changed with regard to assignment of associated marks by the time the current dispute arose. Under the previous law, there was no statutory provision governing assignment of associated marks, and everything depended on the Registrar's practice. Thus Goff LJ observed at p 249 of the case as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We are of the view it was in that context that Goff LJ made his conclusion in the <i>PHANTOM Trade Mark</i>'s case about reliance on the practice of the Registrar which the Court of Appeal had erroneously construed as a statement of general principle. The said passage from the judgment of Goff LJ is reproduced herein for convenience:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It could be seen from the above excerpt that the practice of the Registrar in the exercise of the discretion by the court turned on the peculiar facts of the case where under the previous Act relied on by the defendant there was no provision for registration of associated marks but depended wholly on the practice of the Registrar. In our view this became a relevant factor for the exercise of Goff LJ's discretion on the facts of that case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> We also noted that one of the grounds relied on by the Court of Appeal to suggest the wrongful exercise of discretion by the High Court was the reliance on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK>. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the previous decision of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_691;"><i>Sinma Medical Products (M) Sdn Bhd v. Yomeishu Seizo Co Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 691</LINK>; [2004] 3 CLJ 815; [2004] 5 AMR 349 on the application of the said section and instead held it as a further ground on which the Registrar should be heard. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">Section 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Although <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1) of the Act</LINK> begins with the words "notwithstanding ...", it is a general principle that a non-obstante clause cannot go outside the limits of the Act itself. We are in agreement with the contention of the plaintiff that non-obstante clause is subject to the limitations contained in the section and cannot be read as excluding the whole Act and standing by itself. The principle was stated by the Indian Supreme Court in <i>AG Varadarajulu v. State of Tamil Nadu</i> [1998] AIR SC 1388 at [16] as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Accordingly, it is our view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK> only applies to a right to use a mark that has been duly registered under the Act. It is therefore tied to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> which governs the rights given by registration. It reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It follows that the defense under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK> must necessarily be subject to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;35.;;">s 35(1) of the Act</LINK> and other provisions therein. The defendants could use the registered trade mark only if it was validly registered. If it were otherwise, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK> could override such registration of marks obtained by fraud under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;37.;;">s 37(a) of the Act</LINK> or a trade mark obtained which was contrary to law under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;14.;;">s 14(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> and thus provide a valid defense thereof. In our view this cannot be the intention of the Legislature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> On the correct interpretation and application of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK>, the Court of Appeal in <i>Sinma Medical Products v. Yomeishu (supra)</i> had rightly held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK> did not afford a defense in relation to marks which were wrongfully entered on the Register. His Lordship Nik Hashim JCA (as he then was) on this point at p 699 had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Learned author of <i>Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</i>, 12th edn at p 303 states that under s 4(4) of the English Trade Marks Act 1938 [which is substantially similar with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;40.;;">s 40(1)(f) of the Act</LINK>] only a valid registration gives rights under s 4(4). The subsection states "the right to the use of the defendant's mark given by registration". But it refers back to s 4(1) of the English Trade Marks Act 1938 which gives rights only to a valid mark. The learned author goes on to observe that if the defendant's registration can be shown to be invalid and thus expunged it will not protect him in the future. Accordingly, if a defendant pleads a registered mark in defense, the plaintiff should apply for rectification of the Register by removing or limiting the defendant's registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In <i>The Eastman Photographic Materials Company, Ltd &amp; Anor v. The John Griffiths Cycle Corporation, Ld and the Kodak Cycle Company, Ltd</i> [1898] 5 RPC 105, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had infringed the plaintiffs' trade marks by using the defendant's registered trade mark. The plaintiffs also applied to expunge the defendant's trade mark. His Lordship Romer J expunged the defendant's trade mark as being calculated to deceive.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Useful reference may also be made to the case of <i>Berlei (UK) Ltd v. Bali Brassiere Company Incorporated</i> [1970] RPC 469 at p 478 wherein Megarry J held that s 4(4) of the English Trade Marks Act 1938 must be read together with s 4(1). Therefore, the defense under s 4(4) is afforded only to a proprietor of a trade mark registration which is valid. In that case, Megarry J said that since one of the defendant's registrations had been expunged by the House of Lords in an earlier proceeding, the defendant could not claim the protection of that particular registration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> For the reasons abovestated we would answer in the negative the first question posed by the defendants in the first appeal. As for the second question posed by the plaintiffs in the 2nd appeal we also answer it in the negative. We hereby set aside for the same foregoing reasons the order of the Court of Appeal that the defendants' product was registrable as a trade mark under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_175;10.;;">s 10 of the Act</LINK>. Accordingly the appeal by the plaintiffs (the 2nd appeal) is allowed with costs. The appeal by the defendants (the first appeal) is dismissed with costs. Deposits to be refunded to the respective parties.</p>
