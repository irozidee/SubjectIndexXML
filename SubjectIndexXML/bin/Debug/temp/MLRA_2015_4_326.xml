    <p>The respondent had put up three banners at its premises and at a car-park adjacent to its premises in conjunction with a "Festival of Rights" organised at its premises. Officers of the appellant entered the respondent's premises, pulled down and confiscated the banners, ostensibly on the ground that the respondent had failed to obtain a licence to put up the banners as required by the Advertisements (Federal Territory) By-Laws 1982 ('By-Laws'). The respondent sought and obtained a declaration that the By-Laws applied only to advertisements that were commercial in nature. The effect of the declaration was that the appellant's officers had acted unlawfully and, therefore, trespassed when they entered the premises of the respondent. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The principal issue on appeal was whether the definition of advertisement in By-law 2 of the By-Laws ('By-Law 2') applied to commercial advertisements or to all advertisements, commercial as well as non-commercial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> This court was unable to see how control of advertisements, regardless of whether they were commercial or non-commercial by the public or anyone for that matter, was for the good order and government of the local authority. The two matters were unrelated, unless of course the control of advertisements was to prevent anyone putting up advertisements criticising or scandalising the local authority. It was not the appellant's case that this was so and in any event, there was nothing in the banners that had criticised the appellant. (para 8)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the banners were not advertisements to the public for any purpose but were for the attention of and setting the mood for the occasion for the members of the respondent. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant had the authority to make By-Law 2. It had the opportunity to make By-Law 2 clear. It had a duty to make By-Law 2 clear so that those who put up banners on occasions such as that organised by the respondent would know clearly that they had to obtain a permit to do so, and thereby avoid having action being taken against them. By-law 2 was not unambiguous. In the event of ambiguity, the interpretation could not be made in favour of the maker of By-Law 2 even if it was to protect the appellant from an action in trespass. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The interpretation put forward by the appellant that the definition of "advertisement" in By-Law 2 applied to commercial as well as non-commercial advertisements, on private property or otherwise would leave the public in a state of uncertainty and quandary as to whether a permit was needed or not. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> An interpretation that resulted in introducing selective enforcement was difficult to defend. The only other alternative was the interpretation that By- Law 2 applied to commercial advertisements only. The appellant made the By-laws. If the intention was that it was to be applied to non-commercial advertisements, then it was for the appellant to amend the By-laws and to set out very clearly when an application for a permit or for an exemption had to be made and when they were unnecessary. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The appellant had not demonstrated that the High Court had erred, and had so erred that it affected the merits of the decision that demanded appellate intervention to correct the injustice caused. (para 18)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The defendant, the Datuk Bandar Kuala Lumpur ("the appellant"), appealed against the decision of the High Court granting a declaration that the Advertisements (Federal Territory) By-Laws 1982 (By-Law 2) applied only to advertisements that are commercial in nature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The effect of that declaration was that the appellant's officers had acted unlawfully and, therefore, trespassed when they entered the premises of the plaintiff, Badan Peguam Malaysia ("the respondent"), when they did so to remove three banners as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Having heard the parties, we dismissed the appeal with no order as to costs and ordered that the deposit be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The submission for the appellant began with a description of the appeal, the decision of the High Court that the appeal is a fit and proper case for appellate interference, the brief facts, and with the reasoning that the purposive approach is not applicable where the words are precise and unambiguous. It was submitted that since the meaning of "advertisement" in By-Law 2 is precise and unambiguous, the High Court, therefore, erred in holding that applying the literal meaning would lead to absurd results, and that the intention of Parliament was to apply the By-laws to all advertisements including non-commercial advertisements "for good order and government of local authority".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The submissions for the appellant then addressed;</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> By-Law 2 provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The By-Law was made under the power of s 102 of the Local Government Act 1975 which provides <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> At para 47 of the submissions, it was submitted that what is meant by "good order and government of the local authority" is that all advertisements regardless of being commercial or non-commercial in nature must be regulated in terms of its contents, size, suitability and the place it is being proposed to be displayed. We are, however, unable to see how control of advertisements, regardless of whether they are commercial or non-commercial by the public or anyone for that matter, is for the good order and government of the local authority. These two matters are unrelated, unless of course the control of advertisements is to prevent anyone putting up advertisements criticising or scandalising the local authority. But it is not the appellant's case that this was so. And that is right since there is nothing in the three banners that criticised the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The power under s 102 includes the power to make by-laws to regulate, license, restrict, prevent or remove the exhibition of advertisements. It is, however, the by-law by the appellant, ie By-Law 2, that introduced the meaning of the word "advertisement". By-Law 2 defined advertisement as meaning any notification, posters, sign board, directive sign, intimation or publication but makes no mention of a banner. Even assuming a banner falls within such description, By-Law 2 explicitly says it applied where such is exhibited for the purpose of bringing to the notice of the public any article, product, production, trade, business, profession, firm, corporation, organisation, institution, place, premises, event, activity or any other matter or publication but does not include any election advertisement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> That an election advertisement is not included does not mean that every other advertisement is included. By-Law 2, made by the appellant, does not say so. In the context of the other words used, "means any ..., exhibited for the purpose of bringing to the notice of the public any article, product ...", the words "... or any other matter or information ...", the location of the banners alone does not constitute a contravention of By-Law 2 but there must also be the prescribed purpose of bringing to the notice of the public.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was stated at paras 7 and 8 of the written submissions for the appellant, that the banners were for a "Festival of Rights" organised at the respondent's premises:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Quite clearly, although the banners may be seen for the public, the subjectmatter and content of the banners, were not advertisements to the public for any purpose but were for the attention of and setting the mood for the occasion for the members of the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The appellant had the authority to make the By-law. It had the opportunity to make the By-law clear. It has a duty to make the By-law clear so that those who put up banners on occasions such as that organised by the respondent know clearly that they have to obtain a permit to do so, and thereby avoid having action being taken against them. We have no doubt that the respondent, being the Majlis Peguam Malaysia, had no intention of breaking the law. By-Law 2 is not unambiguous. In the event of ambiguity, the interpretation cannot be made in favour of the maker of the By-law even if it is to protect the appellant from an action in trespass.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> To sum up, the issue pursued by the appellant is a question of interpretation, whether the definition of advertisement in the said By-law applies to commercial advertisements or to all advertisements commercial as well as non-commercial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was submitted that the definition applied to commercial as well as noncommercial advertisements, on private property or otherwise, and therefore regardless whether the advertisement is commercial or not, an application for a permit must be made or alternatively an application for an exemption may be made. Counsel for the appellant, however, conceded that banners such as with "Welcome", "Selamat Hari Raya", "Selamat Tahun Baru Cina" or the like do not require that an application for a permit or for an exemption be made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> That submission betrayed the inherent flaw in the submission. It would mean it is up to DBKL to decide in each and every case whether it would enforce the By-law or not. In other than commercial advertisements, it leaves the public in a state of uncertainty and quandary whether it needs to obtain a permit or not. Worse, it opens the way to selective enforcement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> An interpretation that results in making introducing selective enforcement is difficult to defend. The only other alternative without such an inherent flaw is the interpretation that the By-law applies to commercial advertisements only. It is the DBKL that makes the By-laws. If the intention is that it is to be applied to non-commercial advertisements, then it is for the DBKL to amend the Bylaws and to set out very clearly when an application for a permit or for an exemption has to be made and when they are unnecessary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is not therefore, in our view, demonstrated by the appellant, that the High Court had not only erred, but had so erred affecting the merits of the decision that it demands appellate intervention to correct the injustice caused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal.</p>
