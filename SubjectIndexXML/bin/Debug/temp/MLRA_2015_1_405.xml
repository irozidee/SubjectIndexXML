    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The 1st respondent ("main contractor") awarded a building sub-contract to the appellant. The parties agreed that all payments received under the main contract were to be paid into a "project account". The main contractor issued an "irrevocable mandate" to the bank to this effect. The appellant was paid interim progress payments right up to Progress Payment No 9. The 1st respondent then refused to pay Progress Payment No 10. Money for this payment was received but not paid into the project account. The appellant applied for an injunction to compel payment of Progress Payment No 10 into the project account. The appellant thereafter commenced two civil suits against the main contractor and its directors. In the first suit, the appellant sought damages for breach of contract, breach of trust, fraud and deceit and for declarations that it was entitled to perform all obligations and to all sums paid into the project account. In the second suit, the appellant sought damages <i>inter alia</i> for wrongful termination by the main contractor. The appellant also sought declarations that the main contractor and its directors were liable to the appellant as constructive trustee of the monies received. The High Court allowed the appellant's first suit for damages in part but dismissed the second suit. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Whilst the doctrine of substantial performance would entitle the appellant to seek payment, it did not entitle the appellant to be paid for the remaining work not done, and/or for defective work. Neither did it disentitle the main contractor from terminating the contract and evicting the appellant from the site if the appellant failed to complete the balance of work not done, or failed or refused to rectify the defective works. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Even though the submissions argued "<i>mala fides</i>", the evidence showed conduct and relationship between parties where work was performed by the appellant and payments for work done by the appellant and received by the main contractor from the principal were paid into the project account. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The High Court directed its attention to evidence of the claim, work not done and rectification of defects and made orders accordingly. The appellant did not demonstrate where the High Court erred in arriving at its decision and in making the orders that it made. (paras 38-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The allegation of fraud was totally without foundation and ill-conceived. The arguments amounted to no more than a perverse construction of the facts to support an otherwise empty allegation of fraud. The High Court did not err in rejecting that there was fraud. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The non-payment to the appellant amounted to a breach of contract as to payment and simply resulted in a debt owed by the main contractor, for which the remedy was to mount a civil suit. It provided no grounds to establish a case for breach of trust, injunction and contempt of court. There was no legal principle that the monies payable under a contract <i>ipso facto</i> became money held on trust to pay the contractor. (paras 49 &amp; 60)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Since the appellant had failed to demonstrate where the High Court had erred as alleged, there was no reason to intervene. To do so would be contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. (para 66)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The law of contracts was codified and well-established, and it was not for the courts to legislate by introducing legal rights against those who were not party to the contract between the appellant and its main contractor. In so far as the action was founded upon the tort of fraud and conspiracy, it was clear that the appellant had failed to prove its case. (para 69)</p>

    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by a sub-contractor Kurdamai Construction And Engineering Sdn Bhd ("the appellant") against the decision of the High Court in Civil Suit No: (S10)S4-22-904-2006 against Innoseven Sdn Bhd ("the main contractor") and company director, Abdul Rahim bin Talib, and in Civil Suit No: (S10)S3-22-875-2008 against Innoseven Sdn Bhd ("the main contractor"), company directors Abdul Rahim bin Talib and Hamimesa bin Mohamed, and Syarikat Perumahan Negara Berhad ("SPNB"), <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The case for the appellant may be summarised as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Desirous to revive an abandoned project, SPNB awarded a contract ("the main contract") for "Cadangan Pemulihan Perumahan Taman Desa Rakyat Perdana yang mengandungi 1030 Unit Rumah Pangsa Kos Rendah 5 Tingkat Di atas Lot PTD 115591 Seluas 28.74 Ekar, Jalan Kong-Kong, Mukim Plentong, Daerah Johor Bharu, Johor" ("the project") on 28 April 2005 to the main contractor. Practical Completion for the project was certified in or early June 2008. The Certificate of Fitness for Occupation was issued on 6 August 2006 for part of the project and 31 March 2007 for the balance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Almost a month later on 16 May 2002, the main contractor awarded to the appellant a sub-contract. At the same time as the sub-contract, the main contractor executed a deed of assignment and a Power of Attorney in favour of the appellant. Following delivery by the appellant to the main contractor of a performance bond as required by way of a bank guarantee for the sum of RM671,500.00, the main contractor, on 11 May 2005, issued an "irrevocable mandate" to Public Bank that all payments received under the main contract are to be paid into the "project account". The appellant was notified of this arrangement by the main contractor's letter of 18 July 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The sub-contract commenced on 17 May 2005 and was completed 15 May 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> There is no dispute that the appellant had been paid up to interim Progress Payment No 9. Dispute began with interim Progress Payment No 10 for the sum of RM894,000.00 which was received but which failed to be paid into the project account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant obtained an <i>ex parte</i> injunction on 8 September 2006, and a mandatory injunction on 13 February 2007 for the interim payment under interim Progress Payment No 10 to be paid into the project account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant was evicted from the site in October 2006, after termination dated 21 September 2006 by the main contractor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant maintains it had completed its obligations under the sub-contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant commenced the two civil suits:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The responses are as follows:</p>

      <b>Appeal Submissions For Appellant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Before us, written submissions were made for the appellant under the following headings which we address ad seriatim. Having heard oral submissions, we had reserved our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground's 1, 3 And 4 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> This comprised the following grounds from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Before us, the submissions on these issues stressed the money spent by the appellant, that the photographs relied upon to show works not done do not show the percentage of work done, and while denying there was work done by the main contractor or SPMB, it was submitted that the work cannot be to the amount as claimed because the defects certified in the Final Account is only RM179,093.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The only point that might be of substance is the submission with reference to cl 17.2 of the sub-contract that the subcontractor be given 30 days' notice to remedy the defects notified. Even so, the submission made was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The notice of termination was issued by the main contractor. It had nothing to do with SPMB. We, therefore, find this part of the submission leads to nowhere.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It was submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The submission against termination addresses termination for failure to remedy defects notified. It does not address termination by non-performance in completing only 96.4% of the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> It was also submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The argument is that if there were in fact defects to be remedied, SPMB would not have made payment into the project account because there exists of RM1,598,012.12 that had been certified and not paid. We were not shown what is the connection. We find the argument in this submission not coherent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In considering the above, we observe that it is the case for the appellant that it had completed its work by 15 May 2006, and that in the Minutes of Client Consultant Meeting No 13 dated 8 June 2006 it is recorded that progress of work as on 7 June 2006 was 96.4% and this was not denied by SD1.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_814;"><i>Nirwana Construction Sdn Bhd v. Pengarah Jabatan Kerja Raya Negeri Sembilan Darul Khusus &amp; Anor</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 814</LINK>; [2008] 4 MLJ 157, the Court of Appeal declared (per Zainun Ali JCA) the doctrine as to damages on breach of contract:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In our minds, the 96.4% of work is unquestionably substantial performance and entitles the appellant to seek payment. While the doctrine of substantial performance entitles the appellant to seek payment, it does not entitle the appellant to be paid for the remaining work not done, and/or for defective work. Nor does it disentitle the main contractor from terminating the contract and to evict the appellant from the site if the appellant fails to complete the balance of work not done, or fails or refuses to rectify the defective works. We note there is no dispute that a termination notice was in fact issued on 21 September 2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The appellant had claimed an amount payable if (a) the works were 100% completed, and (b) there were no defects. The learned Judicial Commissioner had addressed the works not done on the basis of the evidence before the court, and ordered deductions from the amount claimed. The submissions argued the High Court had erred, but no effort was made to demonstrate to this court from the evidence where the High Court erred in arriving in its findings and conclusion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> A ground of appeal is stated in the memorandum of appeal to give notice to the other party, thereby giving the other party fair and ample opportunity to address the ground of appeal. To succeed in its appeal, the appellant is expected, at the hearing of the appeal, to substantiate its ground of appeal by demonstrating, on that ground, where the error is, how the court appealed from had erred, that the error affected the merits and therefore warrants appellate intervention to correct the injustice that had resulted from that error. It is not sufficient for an appellant merely to present arguments to support the grounds it had set out in the memorandum of appeal, and to expect the appellate court to comb through the record of proceedings and the evidence to make out the case for the appellant. In our view, since the independence and impartiality of a court is fundamental to a fair hearing and decision, a court cannot abandon its non-partisan, neutral, even-handed, objective, dispassionate yet open and fair-minded approach to maintain impartiality to make out the case for a party that does not do it for itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We had reserved our decision with the thought that we would check the evidence in the Record of Appeal in order to determine what had been proved. Seeking a guide as to the extent we can do so led us to the above consideration and conclusion. The system of justice is adversarial not because it is a contest of arguments, but means that it is for each party to make out its case for itself. It cannot depend upon another, and least of all the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We cannot therefore intervene.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground 2 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> This comprised the following ground from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> On this issue, the appellant relied upon the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It was submitted that since the main contractor only objected to the validity of the sub-contract, the deed of assignment and the power of attorney by a letter dated 23 January 2006 and had not raised any dispute earlier, and had made progress payments No 1 to No 9 into the project account, this shows the "niat jahat" and/or with <i>mala fide</i> of the main contractor when it tried to divert progress payment No 10 by directing SPMB, by letter dated 2 August 2006, to pay the progress payment into a new account and not the project account. But even though the submission went to argue "niat jahat" and <i>mala fides</i>, the conclusion of the submission is only as to the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In our view, the evidence shows conduct and relationship between parties where work is performed by the appellant, and payments for work done by the appellant and received by the main contractor from SPMB is paid into the project account. The ground, by itself, however does not lead to any need to correct the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground 5 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> This comprised the following ground from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The submission that the issue of the Certificate of Fitness for occupancy means that the project was completed by the appellant is without merit, for the reason that the issue of it has nothing to do with whether it was the sub-contractor who completed the project. It does not matter who completed the project.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We therefore find no merit on this ground of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground 7 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> This comprised the following grounds from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> This ground is to the effect that the learned Judicial Commissioner had failed to take into consideration that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Before this court, the point of the submission is not made clear. It merely paints a broad outline of what it claims the High Court failed to take into consideration, but fails to address how that failure results in such injustice on the merits of the claim which warrants intervention by an appellate court. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">Section 72 Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (Revised 1972) Act 91</LINK> provides that "No judgment or order of the High Court, or of any judge, shall be reversed or substantially varied on appeal, nor a new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal, on account of any error, defect, or irregularity, whether in the decision or otherwise, not affecting the merits or the jurisdiction of the court."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In our view, the High Court directed its attention to evidence of the claim, work not done and as to rectification of defect, and made orders accordingly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The grounds above and the submission thereon for the appellant do not address and demonstrate where the High Court erred in arriving at its decision and in making the orders that it made.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground 6 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> This comprised the following ground from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It is trite that when someone did not receive what he expected and feels somehow cheated, he says there is fraud. Such "colloquial fraud" or colloquialism is far from what is recognised in law as fraud. In law, fraud must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It involves proof beyond reasonable doubt of the intention to defraud, ie an intentional misrepresentation to another of material existing fact with knowledge of its falsity for the purpose of inducing that other to act or rely upon and resulting in injury or damage to that person. There is no evidence on record of any intention on the part of the main contractor or SPMB at the time the sub-contract was awarded that they intend to seek the sub-contractor to perform works but would be denied payment. The payment of Progress Payments 1-9 negates any fraudulent intent. Nor is there evidence of any intention not to pay when the appellant commenced the works under Progress Payment 10.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The non-payment to the appellant by not crediting the monies into the project account to which the appellant had access was simply non-payment, and if unwarranted, amounts, in law, to a breach of contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> We find the allegation so totally without foundation and illconceived, that the arguments therefor amounts to no more than a perverse construction of the facts to support an otherwise empty allegation of fraud. We hold that the High Court did not err in rejecting that there was fraud.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground's 8, 11, 12 And 13 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> This comprised the following grounds from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The point in Ground 8 has been dealt with immediately above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Perusal of the written submissions shows that notwithstanding the grounds above, the submissions launched upon the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In <i>ESPL (M) Sdn Bhd v. Radio &amp; General Engineering Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, it was specifically provided in the sub-contract at cl 27.1 that the monies was held as a trust fund to pay labourers, suppliers and sub-subcontractors for the project. It was not demonstrated there is any such clause in this case. Our own efforts failed to unearth such clause. Similarly, it was not demonstrated to this court that there was an injunction against SPMB that it cannot make any funds available to the main contractor to pay other subcontractors who completed the works and to rectify defects. A nonpayment amounting to a breach of contract with a contractor cannot prevent a project owner or developer from engaging another contractor to complete the works so that sales and purchase contracts to third parties can be honoured or to remedy defects to honour similar contracts to third parties, for the dispute as to nonpayment is purely a breach of contract for which monetary compensation is adequate remedy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b>
      <i>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v. Tan Kok Ming Philip (supra)</i> provides no assistance. In that case, it was held that the proceeds of sales of the airline tickets were held in trust by the travel agent company whose rights was only to a commission on ticket sales, and therefore cannot use the monies from sales of tickets for conduct of its business.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In our view, the non-payment to the appellant amounted to a breach of contract as to payment simply results in a debt owed by the main contractor, for which the remedy is to mount a civil suit, but provides no raw material to embroider a case for breach of trust, injunction and contempt of court in their efforts to meet the obligations to the purchasers' delivery to whom had been long delayed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground's 9 And 10 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> This comprised the following grounds from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The written submission at paras 49 to 55 thereof:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We cannot fathom the relevance as to when the third party contractors were paid. It is no unusual in urgent cases to take the risk of loss in making advance payments for the purpose of enabling the contractor to start quickly and proceed with work smoothly. SPMB and the main contractor are entitled to issue variation orders, and the consequences of inability of the sub-contractor to perform the variation order is no different from inability to perform any other obligation. That there was a difference between the project consultants AI/ED and the claims for the variation orders underlines that one is the project consultant's estimates, while the costs of the variation orders do not are determined by the contactors available within the time frame required and the process of the demand. It is therefore no evidence of any trick or fraud (muslihat).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> It was submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>

      <b>[54]</b> The basic principle of the system of civil litigation is simple. A plaintiff's statement of claim gives notice of the cause of action and the facts he relies upon. A defendant's statement of defence gives notice of the cause of action and the facts that he disputes. The defect of the rules of court is that it does not state who does what next. If a defendant disputes a fact relied upon by the plaintiff and whether the defendant puts the plaintiff to proof or not, the fact he disputes means the plaintiff is required to disclose the nature of the evidence he relies upon in respect of that fact. The disclosure must be made as soon as possible after close of pleadings. The disclosure of the nature of the evidence relied upon demonstrates that the fact asserted by the plaintiff is not a bare assertion, but is founded on some evidence. It enables the defendant to check and determine whether he requires interrogatories and/or discovery and production in order to verify the authenticity of the evidence relied upon. A defendant does likewise in respect of facts he asserts, enabling the plaintiff the opportunity to check, and determine whether he needs interrogatories and/ or discovery and production to verify the authenticity of the evidence relied upon by the defendant. At the end of the exercise, both parties would have before them the undisputed facts and the evidence in respect of disputed facts, and knows that if the matter proceeds to trial, what would be the facts and the evidence the court will be looking at. That knowledge allows parties to make an informed decision whether to settle and on what terms. At first case management, parties can inform the registrar whether the matter is settled in full, or in part and record judgment in respect of it, and what part remains to be tried. Trial time would be minimised and confined to determination of credibility of witnesses before proceeding to hear submissions on the whole of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The first case management date is also the occasion for parties to raise such matters as failure or refusal to answer interrogatories, or to produce documents for verification as to authenticity, and it is for the registrar then to issue, where warranted "unless orders" to answer an interrogatory or to produce a document within a number of days failing which, what will be the adverse presumptions drawn, and no evidence in contradiction may be admitted. In such case, a second case management date needs to be set.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The above ensures that assertions are addressed so that assertions made in court have basis founded upon evidence. The evidence may be circumstantial or equivocal, but in such case the alternatives should also be addressed so that the balance of probabilities can be examined. No effort to do so was attempted in this case. While it is for the court to make its findings and conclusion, it is not for the court to make out a party's case for him on the basis of his arguments. If the court did so, the other party cannot be faulted for thinking the court is biased in favour of the other party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We, therefore, dismiss these grounds of appeal.</p>

      <b>Ground's 14, 15 And 16 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>

      <b>[60]</b> We have addressed <i>ESPL (M) Sdn Bhd v. Radio &amp; General Engineering Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> earlier above and held it is distinguishable on the facts and is therefore of no assistance to the case for the appellant. There is no direct or specific evidence SPMB held the money on trust for any party. In our view, there is no legal principle that the monies payable under a contract ipso facto becomes money held on trust to pay the contractor. In the said case, there was a specific clause where the parties agreed the money was held on trust.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> We, therefore, dismiss these grounds of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ground's 17 And 18 Memorandum Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> This comprised the following grounds from the memorandum of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The case for the appellant is that the claim for RM3,439,133.52 for payment due including variation orders had been pleaded, and asserting that the sub-contractor had performed the work, the appellant had submitted a "Final Claim" (exh P13).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> It was submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> Yet no effort was made to demonstrate why or how it was "tidak munasabah", to enable this court to consider the submission and to convince this court that the High Court had erred. The court was left to sort and find out for itself.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> We hold that since the appellant had failed to demonstrate where the High Court had erred as alleged, there is no reason to intervene, and to do so would be contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>.</p>

      <b>Jawapan Kepada Rayuan Balas Responden Pertama Kedua Dan Ketiga</b>

    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> This comprised the following submissions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> The cross-appeal was not pursued. There is no necessity to address the above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> In conclusion, we would say that the law of contracts is codified and well established. It is not for the courts to legislate by introducing legal rights against those who are not party to the contract between the appellant and its main contractor. In so far as the action is founded upon the tort of fraud and conspiracy, it is clear that the appellant had failed to prove its case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The appellant's appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs. Costs is fixed at RM10,000.00 for the 4th respondent. Costs is fixed at RM45,000.00 here and below for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents. Deposit is to be refunded.</p>
