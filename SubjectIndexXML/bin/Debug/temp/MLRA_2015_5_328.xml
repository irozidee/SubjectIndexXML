    <p>This was the prosecution's appeal against the decision of the trial judge who ruled that the prosecution did not establish a <i>prima facie</i> case for murder against the accused, and subsequently reduced the charge to manslaughter to which the accused pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced accordingly. In the instant case, during the pre-trial conference between the prosecutor and the defence counsel, the single issue agreed to be tried before the court was 'whether the shooting was deliberate or accidental?' ('the agreed issue'). Hence, the main issues to be decided were, whether the prosecution was bound by the agreed issue; whether the burden was upon the prosecution to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case at the prosecution stage for murder; and whether there was any evidence to support the charge of murder against the accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal and affirming the decision of the High Court):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The pre-trial process introduced to the Criminal Procedure Code vide <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">ss 172A</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172G.;;">172G</LINK> in essence meant that whatever was agreed in a pre-trial conference was binding on the prosecution as well as the defence, unless there was a material prejudice suffered by the accused by the conduct of the prosecution and/or defence counsel. In the instant case, the parties had agreed that the only issue to be determined before the court was the agreed issue. Here, the unrebutted evidence of the Investigating Officer that the accused's act did not amount to an intentional murder and in all possibility the gun hammer was accidentally pressed was sufficient to destroy the case for the prosecution to succeed on a charge of murder. (paras 8, 10 &amp; 11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The subject matter of the agreed issue to be tried was one of finding of fact and the prosecution's position had been compromised to complain that the defence had to be called for to establish that the act of the accused was accidental. This would have been the usual step in this area of jurisprudence relating to circumstantial evidence. Furthermore, accidental shooting was only established at the defence stage. However, in consequence of the agreed issue, the prosecution was bound by its agreement and the burden was upon them to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case at the prosecution stage for murder. This they were not able to do according to law and the accused pleaded guilty to a lesser offence of manslaughter. Upon a perusal of the evidence, there was no material to support a charge of murder and the trial judge had rightly applied the maximum evaluation and the beyond reasonable doubt test. Hence, no appellate intervention was required. (paras 13-15)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>

    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who ruled that the prosecution did not establish a <i>prima facie</i> case for murder and subsequently reduced the charge to manslaughter to which the respondent pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment came up for hearing on 16 March 2015 and upon hearing the appeal, we dismissed it. My learned brother Balia Yusof Wahi JCA and learned sister Badariah Sahamid JCA have read the judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent was charged for murder of one Angelita Poisie. The charge reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It is important to note in the instant case during pre-trial conference between the prosecutor and the defence counsel dated 29 August 2012, the single issue agreed to be tried before the court was 'whether the shooting was deliberate or accidental?' We will deal with the jurisprudence relating to agreements as to pre-trial conference at the later part of the judgment. The pre-trial conference, agreement marked as encl 4, signed by the Deputy Public Prosecutor, the accused counsel and the accused reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It is also important to note that there was no direct evidence and the prosecution case was based on circumstantial evidence. The Investigating Officer, PW 10 had testified in cross-examination by the defence that:</p>

      <b>[5]</b> The petition of appeal reads as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned trial judge in his 10-page judgment had dealt with the facts and the grounds, why the prosecution has not established a <i>prima facie</i> case for murder and why the charge was reduced to manslaughter punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304(b) of the Penal Code</LINK>. We do not think it is necessary to repeat the facts of the case, save to deal with the core issues.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The amended charge reads as follows:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To Agreed Issue At Pre-Trial Conference</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Pre Trial Process introduced to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;;">Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)</LINK> by Acts A 1378 and A 1422 in the year 2011 materially changes the practice and procedure which was in vogue in the administration of criminal justice. In essence, whatever is agreed in a pre-trial conference is binding on the prosecution as well as the defence, unless there was a material prejudice suffered by the accused by the conduct of prosecution and/or defence counsel which will impinge on the administration of criminal justice and the court ought to intervene and make appropriate orders. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172A.;;">Sections 172A</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;172G.;;">172G</LINK> which are new insertions to the CPC, change the rules as to hearsay, admission, confession, etc. <i>Janab's Key To Criminal Procedure</i>, 3rd edn 2014, revised by Dato' Azahar Mohamed and Tuan Ravindran Paramaguru on these sections say at pp 115 and 116 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> We have read the Appeal Record and the able submissions of the Deputy Public Prosecutor as well as the learned counsel. After giving much consideration to the submission of the parties, we take the view that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the instant case parties have agreed that the only issue before the court is whether the shooting was deliberate or accidental. Only if it is deliberate as per the agreement, a charge for murder will bite. The ingredients for murder is well-established and eloquently set out by the learned trial judge as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was unrebutted evidence of the Investigating Officer that the accused's act did not amount to an intentional murder and in all possibility the gun hammer was accidentally pressed. In our view, the evidence of the Investigating Officer is sufficient to destroy the case for the prosecution to succeed on a charge of murder taking into consideration the agreed issue. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_547;"><i>Balachandran v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 547</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 301; [2005] 1 CLJ 85; [2005] 1 AMR 321 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ 311].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> It was also the finding of the learned trial judge that the prosecution evidence has given rise to two inferences namely: (i) that the accused did it intentionally; or (ii) the death was caused accidentally. It is trite that the most favourable inference must be held for the benefit of the accused in a criminal case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The subject matter of the agreed issue to be tried is one of finding of fact and the appellant's position has been compromised to complain that the defence has to be called for the defence to establish it was accidental. This would have been the usual step in this area of jurisprudence relating to circumstantial evidence. Accidental shooting is only established at the defence stage. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2014_126;"><i>PP v. Shahrael Amir Suhaimi</i> [2014] MLRAU 126</LINK>; [2014] 7 CLJ 380 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_571;"><i>Rozmi Yusof v. PP</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 571</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 66; [2013] 4 CLJ 384; [2013] 6 AMR 156]. However, in consequence of the agreed issue, the prosecution is bound by its agreement and the burden is upon them to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case at the prosecution stage for murder. This they were not able to do according to law and the accused pleaded guilty to a lesser offence. There is nothing much the appellant can complain of on the facts and evidence before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It is well settled that it is in the hands of triers of facts to assess the quality of evidence and to determine whether the evidence on record justifies a conviction as well as sentence. We have perused the evidence in detail and we are satisfied that there are no material to support a charge of murder, and the view taken by the trial court on the relevant issues in our view was a reasonable view of the evidence on record, and the court has rightly applied the maximum evaluation and the beyond reasonable doubt test. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_6_705;"><i>PP v. Mohd Aszzid Abdullah</i> [2007] 6 MLRH 705</LINK>; [2008] 1 MLJ 281, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_490;"><i>Tong Kam Yew &amp; Anor v.

PP</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 81</LINK>; [2013] 5 MLJ 827; [2013] 7 CLJ 435].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In consequence, it is a safe decision and appellate intervention is not required. The decision of the High Court is affirmed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We hereby ordered so.</p>
