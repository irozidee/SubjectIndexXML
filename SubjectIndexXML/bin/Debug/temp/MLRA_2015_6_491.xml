    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against his convictions and sentences by the High Court for two charges of murder. In this appeal, the appellant's counsel primarily directed his submission on the manner the trial was conducted in the High Court, where, despite the fact that Justice Ridwan Ibrahim heard the evidence of most of the prosecution witnesses, it was Justice Ahmad Nasfy who made the decision that the prosecution had succeeded in proving a <i>prime facie</i> case against the appellant and later at the end of the trial, decided that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant had made an application before Justice Ahmad Nasfy for the case to be heard de novo on the ground that it was also important for the court to take into consideration the demeanour of the witnesses for the prosecution when giving evidence pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>, however the application was dismissed. Hence, the main issue to be determined in this appeal was, whether the appellant had been materially prejudiced by the refusal of Justice Ahmad Nasfy to hear the case <i>de novo</i> after he took over the hearing of the case from his predecessors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal and affirming the convictions and sentences of the High Court):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, when the application for the case to be heard de novo was made, the evidence of 17 out of 18 witnesses for the prosecution had been heard by the court. The offences took place on 5 July 2005 and the first witness for the prosecution gave evidence on 3 September 2008. The application for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> was only made on 8 August 2012, ie seven years after the commission of the offences. Under the circumstances, the ability of the witnesses might have diminished and to recall all the witnesses after seven years would cause unnecessary hardship to the prosecution in relocating those witnesses as well as being unfair to those witnesses. In addition, it would unnecessarily prolong the trial and increase the expense. (para 66)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Since the credibility of the prosecution witnesses was not an issue in this case, Justice Ahmad Nasfy could rely on the cold hard print of the evidence of the material witnesses recorded by his predecessors to decide the case and there was no necessity for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> by him. The evidence put forth by the prosecution was rather straightforward and clear. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions in the witnesses' evidence. Therefore, on the facts of this case the appellant had not been materially prejudiced by the failure of Justice Ahmad Nasfy to hear the case <i>de novo</i>. Consequently, the High Court was correct in calling for the appellant to enter upon his defence to both the charges and convicting the appellant on both charges upon evaluating all the evidence before the court.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hasan Lah FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was tried before the High Court on two charges of murder and was convicted on both the charges. The decision of the High Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant now appeals against his convictions and sentences to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The charges preferred against the appellant are that he, between 9.30pm on 5 July 2005 and 12.40am on 6 July 2005 at no 49, Jalan 1, Taman Tasek Indah, Kemunting, Daerah Larut Manjung and Selama, Perak had murdered Wong Mun Kin and Kong Poh Chooi, an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The background facts of the case are as follows. The trial was conducted by three different judges at different times. Justice Zakaria Sam had heard three witnesses for the prosecution from 2 September 2008 to 3 September 2008. They are PW1 and PW2, the police photographers and PW3, the store supervisor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The trial was continued by Judicial Commissioner Ridwan Ibrahim from 2 August 2010 to 22 February 2012, who had heard evidence from 15 witnesses for the prosecution. They are PW3 to PW17.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 14 February 2012 the appellant informed the court that he no longer wanted to use the service of his defence counsel Dato' Naran Singh, as he wanted to get a new counsel. Dato' Naran Singh was therefore discharged by the court. On 6 April 2012 the court appointed Mr Ranjit Singh as the new defence counsel for the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> From 30 March 2012 to 18 May 2012 the case was mentioned before Judicial Commissioner Teo Say Eng. No evidence was heard by the court during that period.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> From 23 July 2012 to 20 December 2012, the trial was continued by Judicial Commissioner Ahmad Nasfy Yasin, who heard the last witness for the prosecution, PW18, the Director of Forensic Division, Department of Chemistry Centre.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> After hearing the defence, Justice Ahmad Nasfy held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant on both the charges.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The relevant facts of the case as presented by the prosecution at the trial are as follows. Both the deceased stayed in the house at no 49, Jalan 1, Taman Tasek Indah, Kamunting, Perak ("the house"). Wong Mun Kin was the boyfriend of Kong Poh Chooi.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 5 July 2005 at about 11.45pm V Sivananthan a/l Vello (PW7), who stayed at house no 55 heard a female voice coming from the house shouting "minta tolong, pencuri" and "pencuri dan thief". PW7 then went to the house and when he arrived there he saw Abdul Rahman bin Din (PW6), who was a guard, there.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> According to PW6 on that date, at about 11.50pm he was on duty as a guard in that housing estate. He heard a female voice shouting from one of the houses in Jalan Satu. He then went to the place. Upon arrival he saw three to four persons near the house. PW7 then told him to go to the rear portion of the house. While PW6 was on his way he heard a groaning sound from the top floor of the house. He did not see anyone behind the house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> A few minutes later he saw a figure inside the house. PW6 waited there until the police arrived.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Meanwhile PW7, who was waiting at the front gate of the house, also heard someone moaning in pain from the top of the house. PW7 called the police.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> At about 11.40pm ASP Hilmi bin Ahmad (PW9) received information that there was a break-in at the house. He and his men went to the house. At the house he saw a group of people there. From outside of the house PW9 could see a male person walking inside the house. That person was holding a bag in his left hand. PW9 also saw a body lying on the floor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> At about 12.15am PW9 decided to enter the house. As the door of the house was locked, PW9 broke the glass window at the kitchen to enter the house. Once inside PW9 then opened the main door of the house to allow his men to enter the house. After his men entered the house PW9 closed and locked the main door.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On the ground floor PW9 and his team found a body, with hands and legs tied up, lying on the floor. PW9 and two of his men went up to the top floor of the house. From one of the rooms he could see a body of a female person lying at the balcony. The body was covered with blood.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> PW9 also saw a person (later identified to be the appellant) hiding behind the air conditioner compressor as shown in photograph P4(X). Upon seeing PW9 and his men, the appellant asked PW9 to shoot him. The appellant was then apprehended and handcuffed by PW9. PW9 found a black bag (P17A) at the place where the appellant was hiding. Upon inspection, PW9 found that the female person was already dead.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Inside P17A PW9 found, among others, credit cards and identification cards belonged to the two deceased. Also found inside the bag were a Samsung handphone, a bunch of keys and a Mercedez car key, a bracelet stained with blood, a blood-stained knife, wallets, a blood-stained glove, a piece of blood-stained cloth and a wrist-watch.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Dato Dr Bhupinder Singh (PW17), a Consultant Forensic Pathologist, carried out the post-mortem examinations on the two bodies at Hospital Taiping. From the external examination of the body of Wong Mun Kin, PW17 found 15 injuries on the deceased's body and from the internal examination of the body PW17 found, <i>inter alia</i>, the right cornu of the thyroid cartilage was fractured with marked haemorrhage surrounding it. The ribcage showed fractures of the left first to the sixth ribs. In PW17's opinion the cause of death of Wong Mun Kin was "Asphyxia due to pressure on the neck".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> With regard to the body of Kong Poh Chooi, PW17 found 20 injuries. From internal examination of the body, PW17 found the following injuries:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Mr Lim Kong Boon (PW18), the Director of Forensic Division, Department of Chemistry Centre, Petaling Jaya, confirmed that he received 41 exhibits from ASP Seah Chong Seng (PW13), the Investigating Officer for the case on 12 October 2005. PW18 was asked to carry out examination and analysis for the presence of the biological evidence on the exhibits and to carry out further DNA analysis if the biological evidence was detected. PW18, <i>inter alia</i>, found that the blood stains on the knife and the glove belonged to both the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> At the close of the prosecution's case, the trial judge was satisfied that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established against the appellant on both the charges and called the appellant to enter upon his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In his defence, the appellant testified that on that day while he was jogging at Taman Lake View he heard voices asking for help. He then went to the house to see what happened. Upon arrival at the house he saw someone running out of the house. He then went into the house as the door was not locked.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Inside the house, he saw a body covered with blood lying on the floor. The appellant then locked the door. He then went upstairs. He saw a man on the verandah of the house. When he was at the verandah he saw another body also covered with blood lying on the floor. At the same time he saw someone jumping down from the top floor of the house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> At about the same time he heard the door of the house was being forced open. A few persons rushed towards him and ordered him to surrender. He was arrested by the police. He denied that he told the police to shoot him before he was arrested by the police.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the appellant primarily directed his submission on the manner the trial was conducted in the High Court. Despite the fact that Justice Ridwan Ibrahim heard the evidence of most of the prosecution witnesses, it was Justice Ahmad Nasfy who made the decision that the prosecution had succeeded in proving a <i>prime facie</i> case against the appellant and later at the end of the trial decided that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> During the trial, an application was made before Justice Ahmad Nasfy by the new counsel for the appellant for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> on the ground that it was also important for the court to take into consideration the demeanour of the witnesses for the prosecution when giving evidence pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. That application was opposed by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The application for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> was dismissed by Justice Ahmad Nasfy. At the same time Justice Ahmad Nasfy informed learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant was allowed to recall any witnesses for the prosecution. However the defence decided not to recall any of them. The court gave the following reasons for dismissing the application for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It was therefore submitted that in the circumstances of the case, the appellant had been seriously prejudiced when Justice Ahmad Nasfy decided that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case without having seen and heard the relevant material witnesses for the prosecution (such as PW6, PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW13).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that Justice Ahmad Nasfy had failed to direct his mind to the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> in making his decision to reject the appellant's application for the trial to be heard <i>de novo</i> on the ground that he was also directed/ instructed to continue the trial under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. It was the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that in rejecting the appellant's application for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> Justice Ahmad Nasfy had also failed to take into account the legal principles in the following cases:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that Justice Ahmad Nasfy further erred in facts and in law when he rejected the appellant's application for the trial to be heard <i>de novo</i> for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Finally, it was submitted that even if Justice Ahmad Nasfy had rightly exercised his discretion in deciding to continue with the trial under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, the learned Judicial Commissioner should have also exercised his discretion under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;18.;;">s 18(3) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> by recalling some of the material prosecution witnesses before he could determine whether a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out against the appellant. Under the circumstances, learned counsel for the appellant urged this court to invoke the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;18.;;">s 18 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In response, learned Deputy Public Prosecutor submitted that on the facts of this case, the demeanour and credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution was not in doubt. The material witnesses for the case were the police officers and they were credible witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> We will begin our deliberation on the issue by looking at the cases cited by learned counsel for the appellant and other cases related to the issue. In <i>Mohamed Idris Bin Haji Mohamed Said v. Rex (supra)</i> the appellant was charged for theft. The appellant was employed as a clerk by the Singapore Harbour Board. A detective saw him carrying various articles, including a bottle of gin, a lady's hand-bag, two tins containing cake and four tubes of toothpaste. The evidence showed that it would be within the scope of his duties to collect things of that kind, if he found them lying about, and place them in proper custody. The whole question of whether the appellant was guilty of stealing the goods in question depended on the inference the court could draw from the circumstances in which the detective found the appellant carrying, whether the appellant had concealed them on his person, or whether he had put various articles inside his shirt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The Magistrate who had begun the hearing of the case left and another Magistrate continued the hearing. The question was whether the new Magistrate should exercise the powers given under s 254 of the Straits Settlement Criminal Procedure Code (which is <i>in pari materia</i> with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of our Code</LINK>) and act on the evidence recorded by his predecessor. The new Magistrate decided to act on evidence recorded by his predecessor. On appeal a new trial was ordered by the High Court. In his judgment Murray-Aynsley CJ opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In <i>Teay Wah Cheong v. Public Prosecutor (supra)</i> the accused was charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304A.;;">s 304A of the Penal Code</LINK>. He was found guilty, convicted and sentenced to two weeks' imprisonment and fined RM500.00. In this case a President of the Sessions Court recorded evidence of the eight witnesses. He was then succeeded by the new President of the Sessions Court. The succeeding President recorded further evidence and came to a finding. In his grounds of judgment the learned President stated that there was in fact only one eye-witness to the accident, presumably the wife of Abdul Salam whose evidence was recorded by the succeeding President. However the whole record showed that there were two other eye-witnesses whose evidence was recorded by his predecessor. In allowing the appeal by the accused, Hashim J at p 156, had this to say:</p>

      <b>[37]</b> In <i>Oh Keng Seng v. Public Prosecutor (supra)</i> the applicant was accused of uttering seditious words under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1969_15;4.;;">s 4(1)(b) of the Sedition Act 1948</LINK> on 1 March 1974. He was charged in the Sessions Court. The trial had so far lasted six days over a period of about a year and two months. A total of 12 prosecution witnesses had completed their testimony and the 13th and last witness for the prosecution was in the box waiting to be cross-examined by the defence after having completed his evidence-in-chief.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> When the case came up for further hearing on 5 May 1975 the President of the Sessions Court had already been posted to Kedah as a Deputy Public Prosecutor and before any evidence was recorded on that day learned counsel for the applicant objected to the said President of the Sessions Court hearing the case any further but his objection was overruled.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The applicant moved the High Court for an order that the said President of the Sessions Court be precluded from continuing the hearing of the case and a further ordered that the case be heard <i>de novo</i> by the succeeding President. Among the reasons given by the applicant to support his application was that he might not get a fair trial if the case was continued by the said President of the Sessions Court. It was also alleged that the transfer of the said President of the Sessions Court to the post of Deputy Public Prosecutor was in effect an abrogation of his previous post as President of the Sessions Court. It was further alleged that there was a real likelihood of the said President of the Sessions Court being biased and that it would be contrary to public policy and natural justice if the said President of the Sessions Court presided over that matter as that would impose on him the dual role of prosecutor as well as the presiding officer of the same court at one and the same time. That would be embarrassing to the said President of the Sessions Court and would be prejudicial to a fair trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> In its judgment the High Court made the following observation at pp 93 and 94:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In <i>Public Prosecutor v. Mohd Jon (supra)</i> the accused was charged with trafficking in dangerous drug under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK> and the former trial judge, who had since retired, ruled that there was no case for the accused to answer at the close of the prosecution's case. On the prosecution's appeal, the then Supreme Court ordered that the defence be called. The prosecution contended that the succeeding judge should continue from the defence stage. The defence, however, objected to the continuation of the hearing from the defence stage because firstly the order of the Supreme Court was not clear and there was no formal order in writing issued and secondly, the present trial judge would be very much at the disadvantage of not having the means to assess the demeanour of the witnesses so far called.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The High Court ordered the trial to be heard <i>de novo</i>. In its judgment the High Court made the following observation at p 314:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In <i>Gunasekaran Buchia lwn. Pendakwa Raya (supra)</i> the appellant was convicted of an offence of dangerous driving under s 34(A)(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1958. The trial started on 23 December 1991 before a Magistrate who had heard evidence from three prosecution witnesses comprising a cyclist who was involved in the accident, the deceased's mother and the Investigation Officer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> When the case came up for continuation of hearing the Magistrate had been transferred. The succeeding Magistrate, even though after being informed by both parties that the case was ordered to be heard <i>de novo</i> by "Mahkamah Agung", decided to continue the trial of the case pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution the appellant was called to enter his defence. The appellant elected to remain silence. He was found guilty and convicted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the appeal before the High Court learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there were numerous contradictions in the evidence of the deceased's mother and the identity of the post-mortem report tendered in court was unsatisfactory. The issue for determination in the High Court was whether the decision of the succeeding Magistrate to continue the trial without hearing the evidence of an important witness for the prosecution was proper and whether the appellant ought to be ordered to enter his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> In allowing the appeal, the High Court held that the discretion to be exercised under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> ought to be exercised in exceptional cases only to ensure that the appellant was not prejudiced by the decision of the succeeding Magistrate not to rehear the witnesses. Since the evidence of the cyclist was crucial to the decision of the succeeding Magistrate it was therefore necessary for the succeeding Magistrate to rehear the evidence of that witness. The decision of the succeeding Magistrate had therefore prejudiced the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> At p 107 of the report, the High Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In <i>Mohd Shukur Hassan &amp; Anor v. PP (supra)</i> the two appellants were charged with the offence of statutory rape. The trial was initially conducted by a Sessions Court Judge who heard the entire prosecution's case and then called upon both the appellants to enter their defence. He heard the 1st appellant's evidence and mid-way through hearing the evidence of the second appellant he ceased to carry on with the trial as he was suspended as a result of being charged for an offence. The case was continued and completed by another Sessions Court Judge. The appellants were found guilty and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment with five strokes of rattan each.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Dissatisfied with that decision, they appealed to the High Court. One of the issues argued in the appeal was whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> had been rightly invoked by the succeeding Sessions Court Judge in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In allowing the appeal and ordering a retrial, the High Court at p 382, held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> All the cases referred to above seem to suggest that where the demeanour and credibility of the witnesses who had given evidence earlier were crucial or became an issue, the succeeding magistrate or judge had to hear the case <i>de novo</i> or recall the relevant witnesses to ensure that the succeeding magistrate or judge was able to assess personally the demeanour and credibility of the relevant witnesses. This is because the succeeding magistrate or judge who acted on the evidence of witnesses whom he had not heard and seen was obviously at some disadvantage particularly in respect of the demeanour and credibility of those witnesses. There was therefore a real risk that the accused might be materially prejudiced under the circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> On the other hand, there are cases which held that the succeeding magistrate or judge need not hear the case <i>de novo</i> and could act based on the cold hard print of the evidence. This is more so where the facts of the case were straightforward and the credibility of the witnesses were not crucial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In <i>Public Prosecutor v. Kulasingam (supra)</i> the accused was charged for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;409.;;">s 409 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The prosecution case commenced on 15 June 1971. After a protracted hearing of 27 prosecution witnesses who produced 98 exhibits, the defence was called on 20 September 1972. The first defence witness was called to give evidence on 26 January 1973. The President of the Sessions Court who originally tried the case was transferred to be a Deputy Public Prosecutor. The succeeding President made an order for the case to be tried <i>de novo</i>. When the case came up for continuation before another President the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor suggested that the case be continued under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. Defence counsel objected. The matter came before the High Court for revision.</p>

The appellant was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment and 10 strokes of the rattan.

    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> In his judgment the learned High Court Judge opined at p 469 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

Public Prosecutor</i> [1996] 3 MLRH 278</LINK>; [1996] 3 MLJ 298; [1997] 3 CLJ 243, both the appellants were charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961. The trial had reached a stage where the prosecution had called 13 witnesses by the time the succeeding Sessions Court Judge took over the proceedings. The succeeding judge, in exercising his discretionary power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>, ordered the case be continued by him from the point where it had been left, and not <i>de novo</i>. The appellants appealed against the ruling. In dismissing the appeal the High Court, <i>inter alia</i>, held that to hear the case <i>de novo</i> would not be the best course to adopt as the ability of the witnesses to recall events may have diminished with a lapse of six years. It would also unnecessarily prolong the trial and increase the expense.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_3_72;"><i>PP v. Mohamed Azmin Ali</i> [2000] 3 MLRH 72</LINK>; [2000] 7 CLJ 628, the respondent was discharged and acquitted in the Sessions Court at the close of the prosecution case. Upon an appeal by the Public Prosecutor, the High Court ruled that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case and ordered the respondent to enter on his defence. The case was remitted to the Sessions Court for continued trial. In the Sessions Court, the respondent demanded to recall a prosecution witness under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. The Sessions Court Judge allowed the recall.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The issue for revision before the High Court was whether the demand to recall the witness under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261</LINK> was proper. In its judgment the High Court, at p 80, had this to say:</p>

      <b>[60]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_29;"><i>Ranjit Singh Jit Singh v. PP</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 29</LINK>; [2012] 6 MLJ 316; [2012] 10 CLJ 128 the appellant was sentenced to death by the High Court after being found guilty of trafficking in dangerous drugs under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK>. Two witnesses for the prosecution, PW1 (the raiding officer) and PW2 (the Government chemist) testified before the first High Court Judge. The trial was then continued before the succeeding High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> In his appeal to the Court of Appeal the appellant, <i>inter alia</i>, contended that the second High Court Judge who had continued with the hearing of the trial after the first judge was transferred could not have exercised maximum evaluation of the evidence of PW1 and PW2 because their evidence were recorded, and their demeanour when testifying was observed, by the first judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In dismissing the appellant's contention, the Court of Appeal held that the second judge, in keeping with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;18.;;">s 18(2)(a)(ii) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, had clearly acted upon the evidence as partly recorded by the first judge and partly by himself. There was no necessity for the second judge to have looked at PW1's demeanour to anchor liability on the appellant. The facts were straightforward and the notes of evidence spoke a thousand words. The judge was not concerned about the demeanour of PW1 and PW2 but about the cold print of their evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The latter category of cases seem to suggest that in exercising its discretion under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, the court had taken into consideration other factors, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> It is to be noted that all the High Court cases referred to above dealt with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>. Only in <i>Ranjit Singh Jit Singh (supra)</i> the Court of Appeal dealt with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;18.;;">s 18(2) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>. The two provisions are substantially similar in nature. For ease of reference the two provisions are reproduced below.</p>
    <p>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;261.;;">Section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> The two provisions clearly provided that if the accused had been materially prejudiced by the decision of the trial Magistrate/judge in convicting him based on evidence not wholly recorded by the convicting Magistrate/judge the appellate court may set aside the conviction and order a new trial. As such the issue in this appeal is whether the appellant had been materially prejudiced by the refusal of Justice Ahmad Nasfy to hear the case <i>de novo</i> after he took over the hearing of the case from his predecessors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> In the instant case when the application for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> was made, the evidence of 17 out of 18 witnesses for the prosecution had been heard by the court. The offences took place on 5 July 2005 and the first witness for the prosecution gave evidence on 3 September 2008. The application for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> was only made on 8 August 2012, which was about seven years after the commission of the offences. Under the circumstances we are of the view that after a lapse of seven years the ability of the witnesses might have diminished and to recall all the witnesses after seven years would cause unnecessary hardship to the prosecution in relocating those witnesses as well as it would be unfair to those witnesses. In addition it would unnecessarily prolong the trial and increase the expense.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The prosecution case rested entirely on circumstancial evidence. Five of the prosecution witnesses were civilians. SP5 testified that she knew the deceased Khong Poh Chooi because the deceased and her worked with Alice Academy, Taiping between 2004 and 2005. She was not cross-examined by the defence counsel. The other two civilian witnesses, PW6 and PW7, were briefly cross-examined by the defence counsel. SP10 (Mok Choy Leng) and SP11 (Kong Chiew Leong) testified that they knew the two deceased. Their testimonies were short and they were not cross-examined by the defence counsel. There were no contradictions in the evidence of these five witnesses. Their credibility was not an issue. This is supported by the fact that in his appeal to the Court of Appeal the appellant did not raise any issue on the credibility of these witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Nine of the prosecution witnesses were police officers, two were the Government chemists and the other two were the Consultant Forensic Pathologist and the Assistant Medical Officer. Again, their credibility was not an issue before the Court of Appeal. The only issues raised in the appeal before the Court of Appeal were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Since the credibility of the prosecution witnesses was not an issue in this case, Justice Ahmad Nasfy could rely on the cold hard print of the evidence of the material witnesses recorded by his predecessors to decide the case and there was no necessity for the case to be heard <i>de novo</i> by him. The evidence put forth by the prosecution were rather straightforward and clear. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions in the witnesses' evidence. Under the circumstances and on the facts of this case we find that the appellant had not been materially prejudiced by the failure of Justice Ahmad Nasfy to hear the case <i>de novo</i>. The appellant's contention on this point is therefore devoid of any merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> On the totality of the evidence adduced, we find that the High Court was correct in calling for the appellant to enter upon his defence to both of the charges. We are also of the considered view that the High Court was correct in convicting the appellant on both charges after the court had evaluated all evidence before the court. In the circumstances we find the convictions are safe.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> For the reasons given, the appellant's appeal is dismissed. The convictions and sentences are therefore affirmed.</p>
