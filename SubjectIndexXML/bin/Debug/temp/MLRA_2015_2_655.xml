    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff was a Kuala Lumpur based company with an office in Bintulu manned only by a Manager - Altar Roland ("AR") - who oversaw all its administrative and financial matters. The plaintiff maintained a current account with the defendant ("the bank"). The plaintiff alleged that the bank had unlawfully or without mandate or authority honoured 196 forged cheques drawn on the plaintiff's current account thereby causing loss or conversion of the plaintiff's monies. The plaintiff sued in the High Court to recover the sums wrongfully debited from its current account. The High Court allowed the plaintiff's action and the bank appealed to this court. On appeal, the bank's main contention was that, manifestly, there was a defective control system within the operation of the plaintiff itself, which had failed to detect the forged 196 cheques drawn on the plaintiff's account over a period of four years (2002 to 2006). It was further contended that the plaintiff had failed to immediately review its administrative controls and put in place adequate safeguards even when it had noticed irregularities in the operations of its bank account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the bank's appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The judge's deliberation and conclusions reached on the issue of forgery of one of the two signatures on the impugned cheques were correct on the facts and sustainable in law. The trial judge's finding, based on a comparison of the disputed signature with admitted documents, was sufficient to conclude on a balance of probabilities that all the 196 impugned cheques were forgeries and the bank ought not to have honoured any of them for payment from the plaintiff's account. (paras 42 &amp; 46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge was clearly in error both on the law and on an objective evaluation of the facts to hold that the bank could not avail itself to the defence of "knowingly or negligently" contributing to the forgery as was available under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of the Bills of Exchange Act 1949 ("BEA")</LINK>. The trial judge seemed to confine himself to the defences available in common law and the bounds of contractual terms in a banker-customer contract. (paras 48 &amp; 51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of the BEA</LINK>, the bank need only show that it had honoured the cheques in "good faith", according to the definition of "good faith" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;95.;;">s 95 of the BEA</LINK>. The legislative intent behind the introduction of s 73A was to impose a wider duty of care on customers of a bank. Whether a customer had "negligently contributed" to forgeries of cheques would be very much dependent on the particular and peculiar facts of each case. (paras 53, 61 &amp; 62)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the forgeries of the 196 disputed cheques took place over a period of four years from 2002 to 2006. The cheques were encashed through the plaintiff's account with the bank and went undetected by the plaintiff over that period. Clearly, there was no system in place at the plaintiff's side to protect its monies in the account. AR was left solely to manage the plaintiff's Bintulu office and had been given custody of the cheque books and to receive the bank's monthly statements. There was no effective check against AR's excesses. The blatant gap in the control or administrative set up of the plaintiff left a ripe opportunity for AR to orchestrate and carry out that fraud on the plaintiff over the period of four years. (paras 65-67)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The proper question that should have been asked and answered in the circumstances by the trial court, was whether the plaintiff was culpable in allowing or creating the opportunity and space for the monthly bank statements to be tampered with, as was the case here. The plaintiff obviously had failed to practice proper oversight and prudence with respect to its financial affairs which at the least required the plaintiff to put into place appropriate internal control systems for the monitoring of operations of its monies in its account with the bank from time to time, and to have adequate supervision and checks on the conduct of its employees entrusted with such responsibilities. There was also no evidence that the plaintiff had independently made periodic checks directly with the bank, either by itself or through its internal or external auditors, to verify the balances in its account with the bank. The leakage of the plaintiff's monies could have been arrested if this had been done. (paras 70-71)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The negligent conduct, as exemplified by the omissions of the plaintiff, was the direct cause that contributed to the "forgeries" of the impugned cheques drawn on the plaintiff's account with the bank which continued over those four years. The plaintiff had fallen victim to a fraud of its own employee on the facts of this case. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">Section 73A of the BEA 1949</LINK> was intended definitely to protect the bank as in the instant case. (para 72)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The evidence before the trial court was that it was the plaintiff's acts of neglect and omissions that contributed directly to the forgeries of the cheques and the consequential losses suffered by the plaintiff. The trial judge erred in ignoring or watering down those indisputable facts or such inferences of fact that were to be drawn reasonably on the evidence placed before the court as a whole. That merited appellate correction. The trial court ought to have held that the bank had established a sufficient defence to the plaintiff's claims within the purview of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of the BEA</LINK> and dismissed the action.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Varghese George Varughese JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appeal before us was from a decision of the High Court at Bintulu which had allowed the plaintiff 's claim against the defendant.</p>
    <p>The appellant/defendant was a commercial bank operating a branch at Bintulu and where the respondent/plaintiff maintained a current account (No: 1106-0010193057)(bank account).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The respondent's/plaintiff 's action was essentially premised on the allegation that the appellant/defendant had unlawfully and/or without mandate or authority honoured forged cheques drawn on the respondent's/plaintiff 's bank account thereby causing loss to and/or conversion of respondent's/plaintiff 's monies. The respondent/plaintiff sought for recovery of those sums wrongfully debited from their current account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> After having considered the submission of the respective counsel for the parties, we had on 14 November 2013 set aside the orders of the High Court.</p>
    <p>In this grounds now issued for our decision, the appellant/defendant will be referred to as the bank, while respondent/plaintiff as just the plaintiff, to best capture the factual context in which the controversy between the parties had arisen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff was a Kuala Lumpur based company with an office in Bintulu manned by a single-staff, namely, a Manager overseeing all its administrative and financial matters. The Manager at the material time of the impugned transactions was one Altar Roland Anak James Nyandang (AR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The bank account was opened in 2001 and in the related plaintiff 's company resolution of 19 May 2001, it was provided that the bank account would be operated on the following mandate:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> An imprint of the plaintiff 's rubber stamp/chop, ostensibly to be used on the cheques to be drawn by the plaintiff, was affixed at the bottom of the plaintiff 's company resolution. However there was no specific requirement stated that such affixed rubber stamp/chop would constitute part of the mandate for clearance of cheques.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Following the aforesaid plaintiff 's company resolution, the bank had obtained on its standard specimen signature cards, the signatures (separately, that is) of Director C, Director N and AR. Similar specimen signatures were also provided by the three signatories on the Bank's Signature Scanner Form.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff 's rubber stamp/chop was however included for in the Signature Scanner Form (termed by the learned trial judge as the 'mandated company chop') and this was in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The complaint of the plaintiff was that some 196 cheques (the suit originally cited 206 cheques) drawn on the plaintiff 's account with the bank had been honoured and paid out (individually for sums below RM3,000.00) when at least one of the two signatures thereon was forged and was not signed by either Director C or Director N.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> During the later stages of the trial, a further point taken by the plaintiff was that there were noticeable discrepancies in the so called 'mandated company chop' used and affixed to the impugned cheques and accordingly in this regard too the cheques were also alleged to have been wrongly honoured by the bank as they lacked authority for the monies paid out of the bank account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Another ancillary complaint mounted by the plaintiff was that there had been unauthorised alteration made to a 'cheque-book requisition slip' which had resulted in three cheque-books being issued when only two had been requested for. It was alleged that the bank had failed to ensure that the alteration found on the requisition slip was duly verified or authenticated, which if done, it was contended, could have prevented the forgeries or fraud perpetrated on the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The drawing of the alleged 196 (206) forged cheques had spanned over a four year period (2002 to 2006). The plaintiff, admittedly had detected some discrepancies within the monthly bank statements in or about November 2005. This had been raised with the bank. However, the bank only reverted in August 2006 with the series of plaintiff 's prior monthly bank statements that had been requested for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Apparently, only thereafter did the plaintiff realise that they had been furnished with doctored monthly bank statements all during that period by their office at Bintulu. This doctored monthly statements had cleverly disguised the unauthorised payments made out from the bank account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Although it was not established on evidence who had perpetrated the forgery of the cheques and the alteration of the cheque book requisition slip, strong suspicion was focussed on AR, who had since absconded from his employment with the plaintiff and was not traceable at the time of the trial. All of the cheques where one of the signatures was alleged to be forged were for amounts less than RM3000.00 each and made out in the name of AR or for 'cash' collected by AR.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The bank had commenced third party proceedings in this action against AR (and had proceeded to enter judgment in default on the said third party action against AR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The first principal finding of the learned trial judge was that the bank had "... acted on a 'forged and non-existent mandate and authority' by accepting the non-mandated company chops to clear payment of the forged cheque ..." and that by this lapse "... the defendant (bank) had failed to maintain a proper system or protocol of examining and/or verifying the authenticity to weed out cheques that bear non-mandated company chops".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In this respect, it was highlighted in the judgment that the chop used on all forged cheques differed from the mandated company chop in that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Despite the bank's objection that this issue had not been specifically raised in the pleadings by the plaintiff, the learned judge was of the view that the particulars of the bank's negligence set out at paras 14.1 to 14.6 of the statement of claim were wide enough to accommodate this as a 'fact in issue' notwithstanding that it only surfaced as an issue for determination, late in the trial. It was the learned judge's reasoning that the term 'signature' in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;24.;;">s 24 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1949</LINK>, could be interpreted to include a mandated rubber stamp/chop and this was consistent with local banking practice which required such rubber stamp/chop to be used too where the account was operated by a corporate entity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned judge also dismissed the bank's contention that there was evidence of different company chops with variations being used by the plaintiff. It was held that if the company rubber stamp/chop affixed on a cheque drawn on the bank account did not conform strictly with the 'mandated rubber stamp', then such cheque with the differing rubber stamp/chop ought to have been rejected by the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The second principal finding of the learned trial judge was that upon the court itself checking upon the signatures alleged to be forged and from the evidence elicited under cross-examination of DW2 to DW18 (the witnesses for the bank), as to the existence of discrepancies in the specific characteristics or features of the alleged forged signatures of Director C or Director N (that is, when compared with the specimen signatures provided), those signatures on the impugned cheques were on a balance of probabilities forged.</p>
    <p>According to the learned judge it was not a case of the signatures being signed differently from time to time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In this respect, the plaintiff had originally attempted to introduce an expert witness report through a gazetted document examiner (PW4) who had studied and analysed the disputed signatures. This report was however not accepted by the court and ruled to be a 'bare expression of opinion'. This was because PW4 had failed to compare it with the Specimen Signature Cards and/or the Signature Scanner Form which was the authoritative sample signatures of the plaintiff 's authorised signatories; PW4 had also failed, according to the learned judge, to give any reason why this was not done.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Nonetheless, the learned judge had then proceeded to undertake an independent examination of the alleged forged signatures before arriving at the findings stated earlier. Here, the learned judge dealt extensively with the testimony of the bank's own witnesses (DW2 to DW18) and stated that the comparisons revealed that the signature of Director N in 192 cheques attributed to have been signed by her were in all probability, forgeries; this coincided in any event with the conclusion of PW4 in the expert report which had not been admitted.</p>
    <p>With respect to the cheques attributed to have been signed by Director C, notwithstanding that PW4's conclusion was somewhat neutral, namely, that those signatures "may have been written by her", the learned judge was inclined to differ and went on to hold that they '... are obviously different from the specimen signature even by a cursory examination of a non-expert'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The court in undertaking the above independent investigation of its own had however cautioned against merely accepting the self-serving evidence of Director N (PW1) and Director C (PW2) (who had denied that the impugned respective signatures had been written by them). The learned judge also noted that the bank on its part had also failed to adduce any evidence to counter the allegation that respective signatures of Director N and Director C, on the cheques in question were 'forgeries', in any event.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On the bank's contention that no two signatures by the same person would turn out identical each time and that there would be slight variations as between those signatures the learned judge's conclusion was as summarised in the following excerpts from the judgment.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Further down in the judgment, it was also observed by the learned judge as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned judge's finding was therefore that the plaintiff had proven on a balance of probabilities that one of the two signatures was a 'forgery' in all instances.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The third principal finding of the learned judge was that the alteration in the cheque-book request slip (to read '3' for the original written '2') had to be signed/countersigned by the authorised mandated signatories to validate the same in similar manner as was required in case of other bank documents, including cheques. According to the learned judge this had been conceded to be a requirement by the bank's witnesses DW1 and DW9. The court was of the view that any such unauthenticated request (as evident in this case) ought to have been rejected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It was the learned judge finding that the careless release of the 3rd cheque book by the bank to AR had enabled him to commit forgery to effect the unauthorised drawings on the bank account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The fourth principal conclusion reached by the learned judge was that the Bank could not avail of the defence available under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of the Bills of Exchange Act 1949 (BEA 1949)</LINK>. The bank had contended by way of defence to the plaintiff 's action on the alleged forged cheques, that the plaintiff had by their acts or omission knowingly or negligently contributed to the complained forgery or the making of the unauthorised signatures.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It was the learned judge's finding that the plaintiff 's "... management set up was sufficient to supervise ..." AR at the Bintulu office and that through the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW6 it had been established that "... the plaintiff had a control system for monitoring the cheques and the bank statement of accounts."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The learned judge while accepting that the 'terms and conditions of Operating a Current Account' applicable in this case required the plaintiff to check the monthly bank statement (forwarded by the bank), and to immediately report any inaccuracies, nevertheless held that it was the plaintiff 's '... Inability to get hold of the genuine statements to check that had caused the non-reporting ..." of such errors to the bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> With respect to the further stipulation in the bank's terms and condition of Operating a Current Account (para 2.13.2) to the effect that if no objection or complaint was received within 14 days of the date of such monthly bank statement, the balance and transaction stated therein would be deemed accurate, the learned judge noted as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> While accepting that such a duty could be created and imposed upon the plaintiff through contract, the learned judge (citing the Privy Council decision in the <i>Tai Hing Cotton Mills Ltd v. Lim Chong Bank Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [1985] 2 All ER 94) was of the view that such a term was insufficient to constitute a 'conclusive evidence clause'. Furthermore, the learned judge noted that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The aforesaid conclusions reached by the learned judge was notwithstanding the decisions of the courts in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_3_58;"><i>Public Bank Bhd v. Anuar Hong &amp; Ong</i> [2004] 3 MLRH 58</LINK>; [2005] 4 MLJ 184; [2005] 1 CLJ 289; [2005] 2 AMR 166 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_701;"><i>RHB Bank v.

    <p>
      <b>The Bank's Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The first contention of the bank was that there was no credible material before the trial court to come to the conclusion that one of the two signatures on the impugned cheques was a forgery. The learned judge having correctly rejected the expert opinion/report of PW4 could not have concluded, it was submitted, that the one signature was a 'forgery' based, admittedly, only on a 'cursory checking' by the court, of the impugned cheques. It was argued that what was before us on appeal was a case where there was insufficient appreciation or assessment of evidence and therefore appellate interference was justified (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_1_95;"><i>Lee Ing Chin &amp; Ors v. Gan Yook Chin &amp; Anor</i> [2003] 1 MLRA 95</LINK>; [2003] 2 MLJ 97; [2003] 2 CLJ 19; [2003] 2 AMR 357) to correct the error committed by the learned judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> In so far as the discrepancies in the plaintiff 's rubber stamp used on the cheques and which was held by the court amounted to breach of the mandate of the plaintiff, it was submitted that the plaintiff 's 'rubber stamp' to be affixed on the cheques would not constitute a 'signature' within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;24.;;">s 24 of BEA 1949</LINK>. Wrongful use of the form of 'rubber stamp' as an alleged breach of mandate had not in any case been pleaded by the plaintiff and the emphasis placed by learned judge in His Lordship's judgment to this aspect of evidence was misdirected and misplaced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Perhaps the principal thrust of the bank's appeal was however that the learned judge had misappreciated the fact that manifestly there was a defective control system within the operation of the plaintiff itself, which had failed to detect the forged 196 cheques drawn on the plaintiff 's bank account over a period of four years (2002 to 2006). Further the plaintiff had failed to immediately review its administrative controls and put in place adequate safeguard even when in December 2005 it had noticed irregularities in the operations of its bank account.</p>
    <p>In this regard, it was submitted, that the learned judge had misdirected himself as well on the law as to the scope of the complete defence available to the bank pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of BEA 1949</LINK> on account of the established evidence of the plaintiff 's own negligence in the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Plaintiff's Response</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In reply it was the plaintiff 's submission that the learned trial judge (having disregarded PW4 evidence) had taken the correct approach to examine the impugned cheques individually for discrepancies and variances before coming to the conclusion that one of the two signatures were indeed forgeries on a balance of probabilities. (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2007_6_128;"><i>Formosa Resort Properties Sdn Bhd v. Bank Bumiputera Malaysia Berhad</i> [2007] 6 MLRH 128</LINK>, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_4_161;"><i>Principal Salute (M) Sdn Bhd v. RHB Bank Bhd</i> [2009] 4 MLRH 161</LINK>; [2010] 5 CLJ 819 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_715;"><i>United Asian Bank Bhd v. Tai Soon Heng Construction Sdn Bhd</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 715</LINK>; [1993] 1 MLJ 182; [1993] 2 CLJ 31; [1993] 1 AMR 612).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It was also contended that the finding that a non-mandated company-chop had been used and such rubber-stamp chop constituted a 'signature' which had to be verified too by the bank, could not be defaulted particularly based on the evidence of the bank's own witness DW18.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In the circumstances, it was argued that it was the bank who had wrongly and negligently allowed payment based on the 196 forged cheques and even in acting on the amended and unverified cheque-book requisition slip. The learned trial judge was therefore correct in concluding that the bank had acted on forged and non-existent mandate or authority and such findings of facts based on evidence should not be easily reversed by an appellate court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Further it was submitted that the learned judge after having given due consideration to the defence available to the bank under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of BEA 1949</LINK> had accepted the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW6 that the plaintiff had in place a sufficient 'control system' for the monitoring of the cheques and bank monthly statements as a fact. There was therefore no negligence on the part of the plaintiff in the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Before us there were basically two issues that called for our consideration. They were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Forgery</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> After due consideration of both, the material before us and submission of respective counsel, we were unanimous that the learned judge's deliberation and conclusions reached on the issue of forgery of one of the two signatures on the impugned cheques was correct on the facts and sustainable in law. We were not inclined therefore to interfere with that part of the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The learned judge had undertaken an examination of the disputed signatures (though only stated as a 'cursory checking') as against the available specimen signatures of Director C and Director N. The learned judge was perfectly entitled to embark upon that course under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;73.;;">s 73(1) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> which provided:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The comparisons by the court were made as against the proved signatures available on the 'Specimen Signature Cards' and the 'Signature Scanner Form'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Further it should be noted that the learned judge did not just rely on His Lordship's own conclusion on the variances noticeable in respect of the alleged 'forged' signatures but also placed much emphasis on the admission of the bank's own witnesses DW2 to DW18 under cross-examination as to the obvious differences and discrepancies in all the forged cheques, as set out in the parts of the learned judge's decision reproduced at paras 24 and 25 above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> As also noted by us above, the learned judge also cautioned himself not to merely accept the denial of Director N (PW1) and Director C (PW2) as to their respective challenged signatures.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> In our view, the finding of the learned trial judge based on a comparison of the disputed signature with admitted documents was sufficient to conclude on a balance of probabilities that all the 196 impugned cheques were forgeries and the bank ought not to have honoured any of them for payment from the plaintiff 's account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Having so affirmed that part of the decision, which held that the disputed signatures were forgeries, we did not find it necessary to make any specific finding that the learned trial judge was correct or not in holding that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Accordingly those issues are best left to another occasion for a conclusive ruling.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Section <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">73A BEA 1949</LINK> - Defence Open To The Bank</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> On this issue, we were however unanimous that the learned judge was clearly in error both on the law and on an objective evaluation of the facts to hold that the bank could not avail itself to the defence, namely of 'knowingly or negligently' contributing to the forgery as was now available under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of the BEA 1949</LINK> (introduced in 1997).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Although the learned judge correctly acknowledged that the burden was on the bank to prove that the plaintiff had knowingly or negligently contributed to the forgery, the learned judge was more inclined, in our analysis of His Lordship's grounds of decision, to be somewhat still restricted to the 'common law' position and previously prevailing considerations. Hence in the application of the law to the facts obtaining in this case the learned judge was erroneously led to conclude that the plaintiff had 'checked (read) the bank statements' and in any case the terms and condition of operating the account (specifically to notify errors within 14 days) would only be binding if it had been specifically brought to attention of the customer.</p>
    <p>The focus of the learned judge was far removed from the critical issue, namely, whether the plaintiff had provided for adequate control system to prevent forgeries and fraud within its own operations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The following excerpts from the judgment of the learned judge were sufficient to bear out this wrong approach adopted by the trial court in coming to the aforesaid conclusion.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The learned judge, with respect, seem to confine himself to the defences available in common law and the bounds of the contractual terms in a bank customer contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> The law on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A BEA 1949</LINK> has now been authoritatively clarified and emphasised in various decisions of our courts. It is necessary to first recall the scope and reach of this statutory defence now open to the bank. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">Section 73A</LINK> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The material words in that provision, that begs emphasis for the defence to be availed of was - "... that person whose signature it purports to be knowingly or negligently contributes to the forgery or the making of the unauthorised signature ...: The 'person whose signature it purports to be' in case of a corporate account holder (who acts through authorised signatories) would mean the customer of the bank (as was the plaintiff in our case).</p>
    <p>The bank need only show that it had honoured the cheques in good faith. 'Good Faith' has in turn been defined at <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;95.;;">s 95 of BEA 1949</LINK> as "A thing is deemed to be done in good faith, within the meaning of the Act, where it is in fact done honestly whether it is done negligently or not.

Tai Soon Heng Construction Sdn Bhd</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 715</LINK>; [1993] 1 MLJ 182; [1993] 2 CLJ 31; [1993] 1 AMR 612:</p>

    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> After the introduction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> by the legislature some doubts lingered as to whether that new section was merely a codification of the two defences already existent and available in common law. A further controversy the courts were called upon to decide was whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> was intended merely to mitigate or reduce the damages payable by a defendant-bank in view of the contributory negligence of the customer or it had the effect to fully absolve the defendant-bank (complete defence) from its strict liability where it could be established that a customer had negligently contributed to the forgery which gave rise to the loss suffered by the customer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2011_5_72;"><i>Globelink Container Line (M) Sdn Bhd v. Bumiputra Commerce Bank Berhad</i> [2011] 5 MLRH 72</LINK> took the position that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> was a statutory enunciation of the common law duty on the plaintiff where forgery was concerned and could go only towards mitigating or reducing the damages recoverable by the plaintiff. A somewhat similar position seem to have been taken by the learned judge in <i>Leolaris (M) Sdn Bhd v. Malayan Banking Berhad</i> (unreported) where it was opined that even if the defendant could avail itself of the protection of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK>, it did not totally absolve the defendant-bank of liability to the customer on the basis (as explained there) that 'strict compliance with the mandate' was a fundamental term of the contract between the banker and the customer in all cases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> On the other hand, the decisions of the courts in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_4_161;"><i>Principal Salute (M) Sdn Bhd v.

(In <i>Formosa Resort Properties (supra)</i>, the court accepted that as a principle of law but on the evidence led before it held that the defendant-bank had not proved that the customer was negligent).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> It is pertinent to point out that my learned brother Abdul Wahab Patail JCA in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2006_4_302;"><i>Melewar Apex Sdn Bhd v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i> [2006] 4 MLRH 302</LINK>; [2007] 3 MLJ 687; [2007] 8 CLJ 579 was not inclined there to accept that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> had the effect of creating a new or complete defence to the defendant-bank. This can be gleaned from the following extract from His Lordship's judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Nevertheless, my learned brother in the aforesaid decision in <i>Melewar Apex (supra)</i> did not rule out that a duty of care could be imputed to a plaintiff to employ a trusted employee and oversee the employee in situations where the employee is authorised to sign cheques on behalf of the employer. This was adequately borne out from the following passage of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> My learned brother Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA in <i>Leolaris (M) Sdn Bhd v. Bumiputra Commerce Bank Berhad (supra)</i>, it must also be mentioned was of the view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> had brought in a wider concept of duty requiring a customer to take reasonable precautions in the management of his business to prevent forgery. It was in that judgment noted as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>More significantly, my learned brother Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA went on to state:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> A similar position in law was adopted by the Court of Appeal in the recently issued judgment in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_5_42;"><i>Prima Nova Sdn Bhd v. Affin Bank Berhad</i> [2014] 5 MLRA 42</LINK>. This court has now affirmed the position taken by previous judgments that the legislative intent behind the introduction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> was to impose a wider duty of care on customers of a bank.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> It was axiomatic that the answer in any case to the question whether the customer, was liable to have 'negligently contributed' to the forgeries, would be very much dependant on the particular and peculiar facts of each case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_1_113;"><i>Leolaris (M) Sdn Bhd v. RHB Bank Bhd</i> [2009] 1 MLRH 113</LINK>; [2009] 10 CLJ 248, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> was invoked and was accepted as absolving the bank of liability. Ramly Ali J (as His Lordship then was) observed there as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> That the duty of care expected of a customer of a bank did extend to cover proper control and supervision of critical staff, to put in place appropriate procedures as to access to cheque books and also entailed periodic checking of one's account with the bank was commented upon by the court in <i>Public Bank Bhd v. Anuar Hong &amp; Ong (supra)</i> in the following words (although it would appear that in that case <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> was not specifically cited):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> In the case of the present appeal before us there was no serious divergence on the surrounding facts related to the plaintiff 's operation of its financial matters and bank accounts generally and more specifically at its Bintulu office.</p>
    <p>The forgeries of the 196 disputed cheques took place over a period of over four years (2002 to 2006). These cheques were encashed through the plaintiff 's account with the bank and went undetected by the plaintiff over that prolonged period. Patently, there was no system in place at the plaintiff 's side to protect its monies in the relevant bank account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> AR was left to solely manage the Bintulu office and had been given custody of the cheque books and to receive the monthly bank statements from the plaintiff. There was no doubt that the presence of even a single accounts clerk or other personnel at the Bintulu branch would have been an effective check against AR's excesses, as occurred here to the detriment of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> PW6, was the plaintiff 's part-time accounts executive who had been assigned the duties to monitor cheque transactions in respect of the plaintiff 's account at Bintulu with bank. She was however based at the main office at Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The monthly bank statements sent by the bank as noted earlier was required to be addressed to the Bintulu office only. The plaintiff ought to have required the monthly bank statements to be sent to their main office instead to safeguard its financial positon knowing fully well that there was no other staff except AR in Bintulu. This blatant gap in the control or administrative set up of the plaintiff left a ripe opportunity for AR to orchestrate and carry out that fraud on the plaintiff over that long period of four years.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> It was further in evidence that the plaintiff had in December 2005 discovered some discrepancy in respect of the operation of their account held with the bank. Yet the plaintiff did not put a stop to the operations immediately and commence investigations on their own earlier when there was a hint of possible irregularity. This failure on the part of the plaintiff to protect its own interest resulted in a further 59 forged cheques (within the 196 cheques) to be fraudulently encashed for a further eight months up to August 2006.</p>
    <p>The excuse given by the plaintiff that the bank only reverted to the plaintiff's request for copies of previous monthly bank statements, was not convincing or acceptable. The plaintiff had always the paramount duty to adequately protect its funds with the bank from being wrongfully taken out. It was not justifiable at all to shift the blame and just ignore the consequences despite being put on alert to such an irregularity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The learned judge, in our respectful view therefore, was only correct to the extent of identifying the actual source of the predicament faced by the plaintiff in what had happened over the four years during which the 'forgeries' went undetected. This was namely that the monthly bank statements sent dutifully by the bank to the Bintulu office of the plaintiff, had in fact been 'doctored' or 'fabricated' and thereafter forwarded to the main office at Kuala Lumpur by AR.</p>
    <p>The learned judge was however plainly not being objective when His Lordship went on to further say that the plaintiff was nevertheless blameless as the plaintiff had no knowledge that the monthly bank statements they received had been 'fabricated'. In His Lordship's words, "... the plaintiff had a system of checking under their control system but were misled by the fabricated statements". We disagree that there was 'a system for checking' or any system at all in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The proper question that should have been asked and answered in the circumstances by the court, in our view, was whether the plaintiff was culpable in allowing or creating the opportunity and space for the monthly bank statements to be tampered with, as was the case here. The plaintiff obviously had failed to practice proper oversight and prudence with respect to their financial affairs which, to say at the least required the plaintiff to put into place appropriate internal control system for monitoring of operations of their monies in their account with the bank from time to time and to have adequate supervision and checks on the conduct of their employees entrusted with such responsibilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> There was also no evidence that the plaintiff had independently made periodic checks directly with the bank, (say quarterly, half-yearly or annually) either by themselves or through their internal or external auditors, to verify the balances in their account with the bank. The leakage of the plaintiff 's monies could have been arrested if this had been done.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> Taken in its totality, there was no doubt in our mind that the negligent conduct, as exemplified by the omissions of the plaintiff enumerated above, was the direct cause that contributed to the 'forgeries' of the impugned cheques drawn on the plaintiff 's account with the bank and this continuing over those four years. The plaintiff had fallen victim to a fraud of its own employee on the facts of this case. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">Section 73A BEA 1949</LINK> was intended definitely, in our considered opinion to protect the bank in such instances as obtained here.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Irrespective of whether <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A</LINK> was a mere enactment of the common law defences available to the bank or it was only an extention of such defences in revised and wider terms or it was a complete or absolute defence, the evidence before the trial court was that it was the plaintiff 's acts of neglect and omissions that contributed directly to the forgeries of the cheques and the consequential losses suffered by the plaintiff. The learned judge erred in ignoring or watering down those indisputable facts or such inferences of fact that were to be drawn reasonably on the evidence placed before the court as a whole. This merited our appellate correction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> The trial court ought to have held that the bank had established a sufficient defence to the plaintiff 's claims within the purview of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1978_204;73A.;;">s 73A of BEA 1949</LINK> and dismissed the action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> For the reasons elaborated and discussed above, we were therefore constrained to allow the appeal.</p>
