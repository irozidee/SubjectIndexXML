    <p>The Industrial Court had dismissed the appellant's application to join the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondents in respect of a non-compliance proceeding pertaining to an award obtained against the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. The 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent, now in liquidation, was the employer of the appellant and the appellant obtained the award against the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent for constructive dismissal. EON Capital Berhad ('EON') acquired the shares in the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent and took over the management of the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. The 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondent companies had a nexus to EON. The appellant then applied to the High Court to quash the decision of the Industrial Court refusing the joinder application. The judge dismissed the application on the grounds, amongst others, that the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondents were not the appellant's employers, and that the liquidator concerned was more than able to represent the interests of the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. Hence, the appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The relevant sections which needed to be considered for joinder of parties in the Industrial Court were <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;29.;;">ss 29(a), (b)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;32.;;">32(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;56.;;">56(1), (2)(a)(i) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ('the IRA')</LINK>. The general jurisprudence from the said sections established that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA</LINK> was a social legislation and that third parties could be made liable to pay the award notwithstanding that they were not the employers. Third parties could not resist the joinder when there was sufficient nexus between the parties to be joined and the party named in the reference. In essence, the threshold test to be employed at the joinder stage appeared to be whether the employee could demonstrate by way of <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the party requested to be joined had directly and/or indirectly and/or otherwise assumed liability or could be made liable partly or wholly for the payment of the award or for that matter purported award in cases where an award had not been delivered. (paras 2-3)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The threshold to satisfy the Industrial Court was low based on the relevant sections as well as the supportive case law in this area of jurisprudence. As long as the complaint of the employee was not frivolous, vexatious and/or abuse of process of court, there should be no hindrance in permitting the joinder if nexus was shown. The issue of liability could only be dealt with after the joinder and hearing on merits. The parties to be joined should not at the joinder stage be allowed to submit on the merits. Their presence at the joinder stage was only to verify the complaint of the employee to ensure that the facts relied on by the employee were credible. (para 3)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Case law in joinder cases must be confined to the facts and the nexus test as to liability. There was no requirement under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">the IRA</LINK> that to enable the joinder the parties must be the appellant's employers. This was a grave error of law that did not subscribe to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA</LINK> and the jurisprudence relating to joinder of parties. (para 11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;29.;;">Section 29(a) and (b) of the IRA</LINK> gave wide powers to the Industrial Court to join or summon any person who in the opinion of the court was connected with the proceedings. There was no requirement that the person summoned must have an employer or employee relationship. The test employed by the Indian Supreme Court in Hochtief Gammon v. Industrial Tribunal Orisa had a restricted application to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA</LINK> and was also not based on an employer-employee relationship. The more appropriate test to be applied in the Malaysian context was propounded by Justice Gopal Sri Ram in <i>Co-Operative Central Bank Ltd &amp; Ors v. Rashid Cruz Abdullah &amp; Ors And Other Appeals</i>. The test was a "reasonable factual or legal nexus" and a wide net to facilitate all maladies of third parties to answer to the Industrial Court for their involvement in the dispute and, if appropriate, be liable under the award upon hearing on the merits. No reasonable tribunal appraised with the facts of the present case would say that there was no factual or legal nexus to the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondents in relation to the award.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant's appeal is against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who refused to quash the decision of the Industrial Court, which refused to allow the appellant to join the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondents in respect of a non-compliance proceeding related to an award obtained against the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent. We heard the appeal on 28 January 2015 and reserved judgment. My learned brothers Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA and Idrus Harun JCA have read the judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminary</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jurisprudence Relating To Joinder Of Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This judgment deals with the jurisprudence relating to joinder of parties in Industrial Court. The relevant sections which need to be considered under the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;29.;;">Industrial Relations Act 1967 (IRA 1967) are ss 29(a), (b)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;32.;;">32(1)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;56.;;">56(1), (2)(a)(i)</LINK>.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The general jurisprudence from the above sections as well as supportive case laws can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> respondent's submission in essence they are not the employer; and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>is a misconceived submission as well as an affront to <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1967_177;;">IRA 1967</LINK> as well as industrial jurisprudence. We will elaborate on this issue further in our judgment in addition to the reasons stated earlier.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondents are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The 3<sup>rd</sup> respondent is represented by one firm of solicitors and the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> respondents are represented by separate firm of solicitors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The basic facts are not in dispute. It can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant Chevalier Ambiga Seenivasagam has summarised the issues relating to the joinder as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned trial judge in dismissing the application for judicial review had in the grounds stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The learned counsel for the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondents vehemently relied on the grounds of the learned trial judge to assert that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We have read the appeal record and the submission of the parties in detail. We would like to thank the counsel for the able submission. We are of the considered view that the Industrial Court has committed grave error of law in the application of fact which the learned trial judge was not able to correct, by issuing the order of <i>certiorari</i> and incidental directions. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> In our view, no reasonable tribunal appraised with the facts of this case will say that there is no factual or legal nexus to the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> respondents in relation to the award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> For reasons stated above, we take the view the appeal must be allowed with costs. The decision of the High Court and Industrial Court must be set aside. And both the applications of joinder by the appellant in the Industrial Court must be allowed and the issue of liability must be heard on merits. Deposit to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
