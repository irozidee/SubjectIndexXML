    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against her conviction and sentence for the offence of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. At the material time, the appellant had called her landlord, SP8, to help her as her stepdaughter ('the deceased') was not well and had fainted. SP8 however was unable to resuscitate the deceased and she was pronounced dead. The appellant's neigbour, SP11, who was also present at the material time, alleged that the appellant was said to have uttered the words "Qis bangun Qis, ibu janji tidak pukul lagi" ('the said words'). The cause of death of the deceased was stated in the report of the pathologist ('SP5') as blunt force trauma which was consistent with child battered syndrome or child abuse. In the High Court, the Judicial Commissioner ('JC') had taken into consideration that, amongst others, the appellant was the only adult with the deceased at the time of her death; and the appellant had given inconsistent and contradictory versions of events which lead to the death of the deceased to both SP8 and SP11. At the end of the trial, the JC found the appellant guilty for the murder of the deceased, and she was convicted and sentenced to death. In the instant appeal, the appellant contended, inter alia, that the JC had failed to fairly appreciate her defence; that the JC had failed to consider the evidence which was favourable to her; and that the JC had misdirected himself as to the admissibility of the evidence of the child witness, ie the deceased's sister ('SP13') under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">s 133A of the Evidence Act 1950 ('s 133A EA')</LINK>. Therefore, the main issues to be considered were whether the JC was correct in convicting the appellant for murder based on the circumstances as alluded to in his grounds of judgment; and whether the evidence of SP13 was admissible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal)</p>
    <p>Per Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA delivering the majority judgment of the court:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The evidence of SP5 was that the deceased died as a result of the blunt force trauma. The JC found that it was the appellant and nobody else who could have inflicted the injuries on the deceased. The basis of such finding was that the appellant was the only adult with the deceased and her siblings when the deceased died. Having perused the record of appeal, this court found that the JC had misdirected himself in failing to properly appreciate the evidence and in failing to consider the evidence favourable to the appellant. (paras 24-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> According to the evidence of SP5, the injuries sustained by the deceased were between 15 and 24 hours prior to her death. Thus, it was incumbent for the JC to exclude any other adult who had access to the deceased during that period of time, before concluding that nobody else, except the appellant, could have inflicted the injuries on the deceased. In this instance, the JC had failed to direct his mind to the fact that the appellant's husband, SP12, also had access to the deceased during the time that the injuries were suffered by the deceased. In failing to consider this aspect of the evidence, the JC had misdirected himself and had erred. Further, there was no evidence from either SP8 or SP11 that they heard the deceased crying that morning prior to the incident to infer that the appellant had inflicted the said injuries on the deceased at the material time. Following that, even if the appellant had uttered the said words, that piece of evidence was not sufficient to convict the appellant for the offence of murder as charged. (paras 27, 29, 30 &amp; 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> On the alleged inconsistent and contradictory versions given by the appellant to SP8 and SP11 as to what happened to the deceased, the different version given by the appellant must be viewed objectively in the context, ie that the appellant panicked and was not in the right frame of mind. The different answers that she had given could not form the basis of finding her guilty. Further, the JC had failed to consider that the appellant's version that the deceased fell in the bathroom was supported by the unsworn testimony of SP13 and the evidence of SP12. More importantly, there was no evidence that the appellant had at any time physically abused or battered the deceased. Hence, there were merits in the instant appeal. (paras 32, 33, 34, 37 &amp; 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In dealing with the evidence of SP13, the JC referred to the case of <i>Sidek Bin Ludan v. Pendakwa Raya</i> and, accordingly, conducted a preliminary enquiry to ascertain the understanding of SP13 on taking the oath and speaking the truth. While the JC found that SP13 did not understand the nature of the oath and the duty to speak the truth, he found that SP13 possessed sufficient intelligence. Therefore, there was no reason to disturb the finding of the JC who had the opportunity to evaluate the understanding and intelligence of SP13 before accepting the unsworn evidence of SP13. (paras 41-42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the final analysis, the conviction of the appellant was not safe. The circumstances did not irresistibly point to the guilt of the appellant and the appellant alone and the combined strength of strands to make a rope was not strong enough to hang the appellant. Accordingly, the conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court was set aside and the appellant was acquitted and discharged. (<i>Chan Chwen Kong v. PP (folld)</i>). (para 43)</p>
    <p>Per Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA (dissenting):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Taken individually those strands of evidence relied on by the JC were insufficient to tie the appellant with the death of the deceased but the united force of all the circumstances put together irresistibly and unerringly pointed to the appellant as the person who inflicted those fatal injuries, barring fanciful possibilities. That was the only reasonable inference that would account for all the proved facts. On the evidence before him the JC was plainly right in coming to the conclusion that it was the appellant who caused the deceased's death. (paras 80-81)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was obvious that SP13 did not understand the nature of an oath. But that was precisely the situation contemplated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">s 133A EA</LINK>, ie that where a child witness does not understand the nature of an oath, his evidence can still be admitted if the trial court is satisfied that he is intelligent enough to understand what he is talking about on important events. In this regard, the JC after hearing further questions and answers to determine the level of SP13's intelligence found her to be a competent witness, though not on oath. This was a finding that the appeal court should not interfere with without any valid reason and there was none in this instance. (paras 86-87)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> As for the question of intention, this was primarily a question of fact and a matter of inference. In this case, the JC after a careful evaluation and assessment of the entire evidence found that the appellant's act of causing the "blunt force trauma to the chest and abdomen" of the deceased was done intentionally. There was nothing plainly wrong with that finding of fact as it was based on actual evidence before him. (para 92)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Having properly directed his mind to the principles to fairly and justly appreciate the defence case, the JC then proceeded to recount the appellant's defence and assessed the appellant's explanation with meticulous care. The JC did not accept her explanation and had given valid reasons for so deciding. Accordingly, the JC was not wrong in finding the appellant guilty of murder as charged. In the circumstances, the appellant's conviction and sentence should be upheld. (paras 94 &amp; 99)</p>

    <p>
      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant Dewi Nadia Alias against conviction and sentence for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. We heard the appeal, at the end of which, the appeal was allowed by majority, comprising my learned brother Justice Mohtarudin Baki and I. My learned brother Justice Abdul Rahman Sebli dissented. The following are the grounds for the majority judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant was originally charged with her husband Norafizan bin Ludin for the murder of XXX (the deceased). The cause of death was blunt force trauma which was consistent with child battered syndrome or child abuse.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In the midst of the trial, ie after four prosecution witnesses testified, the prosecution withdrew the charge against Norafizan bin Ludin, after his representation to the Attorney General was allowed. The trial proceeded against the appellant, the stepmother to the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The background facts have been extensively laid down by the learned Judicial Commissioner in his grounds of judgment. We do not wish to repeat them. Suffice to state that the evidence led by the prosecution through the sister of the deceased, Nur Dania Batrisya (SP13) disclosed that the deceased had drowned. The appellant's neighbour and landlord, Musa bin Hj Othman (SP8) stated that when he tried to resuscitate the deceased by pressing the deceased's chest, water came out from the mouth and nose of the deceased. Dr Rohayu binti Shahar Adnan, the pathologist (SP5) however ruled out drowning as the cause of death. From the post-mortem conducted, SP5 concluded the cause of death to be blunt force trauma to the chest and abdomen.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In determining whether the prosecution had made out a prima facie case for murder, the learned Judicial Commissioner considered whether the necessary ingredients of the offence have been proved:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> There was no issue on the first ingredient. On the second ingredient, the learned Judicial Commissioner found:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> As for the third element or ingredient, namely that the injuries on the deceased which resulted in her death were inflicted by the appellant, the learned Judicial Commissioner said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner alluded to the evidence of SP8, SP11, SP12 and SP13 as to what transpired on the day of the incident and to the evidence of SP5 on the injuries before coming to the conclusion that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> And at para 70, the learned Judicial Commissioner stated that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Finally on the last ingredient, ie whether the appellant had the intention to commit murder, the learned Judicial Commissioner found:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Having found that the prosecution has made out a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant, the learned Judicial Commissioner called upon the appellant to enter her defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant gave evidence under oath. In evaluating the defence, the learned Judicial Commissioner found:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> At para 90 of the grounds of judgment, the learned Judicial Commissioner said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The appellant was thus convicted and sentenced to death, hence the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant raised four grounds of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On the first ground, the bone of contention of learned counsel was that although the learned Judicial Commissioner had carried out the preliminary inquiry to ascertain the comprehension of SP13 of the duty of speaking the truth and the nature of an oath, the learned Judicial Commissioner had erred in admitting the evidence of SP13 as the preconditions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">s 133A of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> were not met.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> On the second ground, the crux of the submission of learned counsel was that the actual cause of death was not attributed solely to the blunt trauma, but was contributed by other factors as the post-mortem report (exh P18) points to the following deductions:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> On the third ground, the complaint of learned counsel was that the learned Judicial Commissioner made the following errors with regard the defence case:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The legal consequences of the failure, submitted learned counsel, were that the appellant was prejudiced in that the relevant evidence for the defence was not properly considered and evaluated and that there was a breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> On the last ground, learned counsel submitted that the learned Judicial Commissioner had failed to consider there were other inferences which were favourable to the appellant and that such inferences indicated that the appellant may not have been guilty of murder, instead the appellant may be guilty of other lesser offences, such as culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304 of the Penal Code</LINK> or under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2001_611;31.;;">s 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001</LINK>. Learned counsel submitted that the conviction against the appellant was not safe and that it ought to be set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The principal issue to be considered was whether the learned Judicial Commissioner was correct in convicting the appellant for murder based on the circumstances as alluded to in the grounds of judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It is trite that in cases where a conviction is based on circumstantial evidence, the evidence must point irresistibly to the conclusion of guilt of the accused and the accused alone and that every possible explanation other than the guilt of the accused has been excluded (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_333;"><i>Magendran Mohan v. PP</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 333</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 1; [2011] 1 CLJ 805).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The learned judicial relied upon the following circumstances to find the appellant guilty:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The evidence of SP5 was that the deceased died as a result of the blunt force trauma. The learned Judicial Commissioner found that it was the appellant and nobody else who could have inflicted the injuries on the deceased. The basis of such finding was that the appellant was the only adult with the deceased and her siblings when the deceased died.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Having perused the record of appeal, we found that the learned Judicial Commissioner had misdirected himself in failing to properly appreciate the evidence and in failing to consider the evidence favourable to the appellant (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_6_296;"><i>Jee Chai Foo v. PP</i> [2014] 6 MLRA 296</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> SP5 said (Rekod Rayuan Jilid II: pp 343-346):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> If the deceased was physically abused and that the injuries were sustained between 15 to 24 hours prior to her death, then it is incumbent for the learned Judicial Commissioner to exclude any other adult who had access to the deceased during that period of time, before concluding that nobody else, except the appellant, who could have inflicted the injuries on the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> From the evidence, SP12's working hours was between 8.00am to 5.00pm every day. SP12 came back from work at about 6pm every day. Undeniably, SP12 had access to the deceased 15 to 24 hours prior to her death as on 9 January 2011, SP12 left for work at about 6.50am.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner had failed to direct his mind to the fact that SP12 also had access to the deceased during the time that the injuries, as testified by SP5, were suffered by the deceased. In failing to consider this aspect of the evidence, we found that the learned Judicial Commissioner had misdirected himself and had erred in concluding that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Further, there was no evidence from either SP8 or SP11 that they heard the deceased crying in the morning of 9 January 2011 to infer that the appellant had inflicted the said injuries on the deceased at the material time, bearing in mind the presence of 77 injuries suffered by the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner had also relied on the evidence of SP11, namely that the appellant was said to have uttered the words "Qis bangun Qis, ibu janji tidak pukul lagi". The appellant denied uttering the said words. In our judgment, even if she did utter the words, that piece of evidence is not sufficient to convict the appellant for the offence of murder as charged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> On the alleged inconsistent and contradictory versions given by the appellant to SP8 and SP11 as to what happened to the deceased, the learned Judicial Commissioner concluded that the appellant was trying to hide something. His Lordship drew the inference that the appellant had the guilty mind.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Through the evidence of SP8 and SP12, the appellant was said to be in a state of panic. In our judgment, the different version given by the appellant to the queries made by SP8 and SP11, must be viewed objectively in the context, ie that the appellant panicked and was not in the right frame of mind. The different answers that she had given, in our view, could not form the basis of finding her guilty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Further, the Judicial Commissioner had failed to consider that the appellant's version that the deceased fell in the bathroom was supported by the unsworn testimony of the child witness, SP13 and the evidence of SP12.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The following was the evidence of SP13 (Rekod Rayuan Jilid IV: pp 755 &amp; 757):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> SP12 had stated (Rekod Rayuan Jilid III: p 684):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> More importantly, there was no evidence that the appellant had any time physically abused or battered the deceased. The evidence of SP12 showed the contrary (Rekod Rayuan Jilid III: p 696):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> SP12 had also testified that the deceased was not well one or two days prior to her death and that the night before her death, the deceased was having fever (Rekod Rayuan Jilid III: pp 705 &amp; 710). This was consistent with the evidence given by the appellant (Rekod Rayuan Jilid V: pp 1047):</p>
    <p>"... pada malam sebelum kejadian, Qistina demam panas. Saya ada beritahu pada Norafizan ... Tapi Norafizan tak mahu bawa anak ke klinik ... Dia hanya meminta saya untuk memberikan Panadol kanak-kanak."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Given all the above, we found merits in the appeal. Nevertheless, for completeness, we will deal with the issue of admissibility of the evidence of SP13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> SP13 was about six years old when she gave evidence in court. The reception of her evidence was governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">s 133A of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In dealing with the evidence of SP13, the learned Judicial Commissioner referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1995_4_630;"><i>Sidek Bin Ludan v. Pendakwa Raya</i> [1995] 4 MLRH 630</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 178. His Lordship conducted a preliminary enquiry to ascertain the understanding of SP13 on taking the oath and speaking the truth. While the learned Judicial Commissioner found that SP13 did not understand the nature of the oath and the duty to speak the truth, His Lordship found that SP13 possessed sufficient intelligence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We found no reason to disturb the finding of the learned Judicial Commissioner who had the opportunity to evaluate the understanding and intelligence of SP13 before accepting the unsworn evidence of SP13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> In the final analysis, we found that the conviction of the appellant was not safe. The circumstances did not irresistibly point to the guilt of the appellant and the appellant alone and the combined strength of strands to make a rope is not strong enough to hang the appellant (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1962_1_32;"><i>Chan Chwen Kong v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1962] 1 MLRA 32</LINK>; [1962] 1 MLJ 307). The appeal was therefore allowed by majority. The conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court was set aside. The appellant was acquitted and discharged.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In the High Court at Johor Bahru the appellant was initially charged together with her husband Norafizan bin Ludin (SP12) with the murder of her stepdaughter (SP12's biological daughter) and the charge against them was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> However the charge against her husband was later withdrawn and thereupon the charge against the appellant was amended as follows:</p>
    <p>"Bahawa kamu pada 9 Januari 2011 antara jam 6.00 pagi hingga jam 9.00 pagi, di rumah beralamat No: 1284-6, Jalan Tengku Mariam, Batu 17 1/2, Kampung Sungai Tiram, Ulu Tiram, dalam daerah Johor Bahru, di dalam negeri Johor Darul Ta'zim telah melakukan bunuh ke atas XXX (No Mykid: XXXXXX-XX-XXXX) dan dengan itu kamu telah melakukan suatu kesalahan yang boleh dihukum di bawah <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 Kanun Keseksaan</LINK>."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> She claimed trial to the amended charge at the conclusion of which she was found guilty by the learned Judicial Commissioner ("the learned JC") and sentenced to death. This is her appeal against conviction and sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The facts as disclosed by the evidence led by the prosecution are as follows. On 9 January 2011 at about 8.30am Musa bin Haji Othman (SP8) was sleeping when the appellant came over to his house in haste ("tergesa-gesa"), informing him that her stepdaughter Nur Diana Qistina ("the deceased") was not well and asked for his help to send the child to the clinic as her husband (SP12) had gone to work. The house where the appellant and her family stayed was rented from SP8 and was not far from SP8's house.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> After putting on his shirt SP8 rushed to the appellant's house together with the appellant. When he arrived at the house he saw the deceased lying on her back in the living room. She was only wearing pampers. He carried her to his car with the intention of bringing her to the clinic but half way through he realised that she was lifeless. Fearing that something untoward might happen to the little girl, SP8 turned back to the appellant's rented house. He laid down the deceased back in the living room and asked the appellant what happened to the deceased. The appellant told him that she had fallen in the bathroom while taking her bath with her elder sister "Ecah". According to SP8 the appellant was crying and asking the deceased to wake up.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> SP8 noticed that the deceased's body had turned pale. He tried to revive her by pressing her chest and when he did this water came out from her mouth and nostrils. SP8 again asked the appellant how the deceased came to be in that condition. This time the appellant told him that she had fallen into a pail of water. SP8 then called the ambulance, which responded by arriving at the appellant's house about 15-20 minutes later. The Assistant Medical Officer on call Mohd Hamka bin Sarijan (SP9) confirmed that when he arrived at the appellant's house the deceased was already dead. He testified that he could clearly see bruises on the deceased's face. SP8 then called the police and SP12 asking him to come home.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Surijah binti Rasah (SP11) was the appellant's next door neighbour. On the morning of the incident she saw the appellant running towards SP8's house and knocking the door. She went over to the appellant's house to check out what was going on. She asked the appellant what happened to the deceased and was told by the appellant that the deceased had coughed, vomited and then fainted. SP11 said the appellant tried to wake the deceased up by saying "Qis bangun Qis, ibu janji ibu tak pukul lagi." ("Qis wake up Qis, mum promise mum will not hit again.")</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> It was also SP11's testimony that she used to hear the sound of a child crying, usually in the evening coming from the appellant's house. She said she only heard the cries in the evening as in the morning she would be away from home attending to her business.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> SP12 is the appellant's husband and they were married on 22 November 2010. Less than two months into the marriage his second daughter the deceased was dead under very tragic circumstances. She was only three years old when she died. SP12 had two other children from his previous marriage. He said the appellant was a housewife and it was she who looked after his three children.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> On events that took place on the morning of 9 January 2011, SP12's testimony is that he woke up as usual at 5.50am, took his bath and then prepared food for his children and his wife before leaving for work at about 6.50am. He said as usual his three children including the deceased shook his hand ("bersalaman") before he left for work.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> As for the deceased's health condition, SP12's testimony is that the night before 9 January 2011 the deceased did tell him that she was having fever ("demam") and asked for panadol. SP12 testified that he had no idea that the deceased had been abused, not until he was told by the hospital authorities on 9 January 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> SP12's further testimony is that at about 8.15am on the morning of the incident he received a frantic call from the appellant asking for help but the line was suddenly cut off. He tried to call back using his friend's handphone but the appellant did not answer. A short while later he received a call from SP8 informing him that his daughter had passed away. SP12 went straight home. The police were already there when he reached home and was told that the deceased had to be brought to the hospital for a post-mortem.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> He asked the appellant what happened to the deceased but the appellant did not tell him anything. When asked whether he saw the deceased's body upon reaching home, SP12 said he did not as he was overcome by emotion, too sad and feeling weak. However he followed the police party to the hospital to send the body for a post-mortem, after which he lodged a police report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The post-mortem on the deceased's body was carried out the following day by forensic pathologist Dr Rohayu binti Shahar Adnan (SP5). She found 77 marks of injury on her body. According to her, all these injuries were caused by force blunt trauma. To appreciate the extent of this little girl's suffering during her brief existence, I reproduce below the full list of injuries that were inflicted on her:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In her oral testimony SP5 testified that the deceased was suffering from a battered child syndrome or child abuse. According to her, of the 77 external injury marks, 33 were concentrated on the head and the other 44 on the upper and lower body and were all caused by blunt objects such as hand, fingers and the act of pinching, slapping and prodding. According to her none of the injuries was consistent with a fall alone.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> SP5's post-mortem report is at exh P.18 and her conclusions are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> According to SP5, injuries that are inflicted externally can have effect on the internal organs. In this regard her internal examination of the deceased revealed, amongst others that the right posterior cranial fossa in the base of the skull was fractured and the left liver lobe adjacent to the falciform ligament was lacerated approximately 2.5 cm deep. According to her the fracture at the base of the skull was caused by force blunt trauma. There was subdural haemorrhage on the right parietal meninges, which she explained refers to the thin membrane just beneath the brain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> SP5 also found contusion and laceration in the right atrium and right ventricle of the heart at the Koch's triangle region. Contusion according to her means bruise. She confirmed the existence of these injuries by carrying out a microscopic examination. SP5 also found bruises on the deceased's intestines which were also caused by force blunt trauma, this time aimed at her abdomen. The cause of death as determined by SP5 was "BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In SP5's expert opinion the internal injury to the heart at the Koch's triangle region was the most fatal and that the chances of surviving this injury were slim as it was an area that controls the heart beat. According to SP5 this injury could not have been self-inflicted by the deceased or due to a fall. A simple fall according to her would not cause internal injury but a violent push to the wall or floor could. SP5 confirmed that the deceased did not die of drowning either, based on the following facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The sum total of SP5's expert testimony is that the deceased's death was due to homicide and not due to accident or misfortune. SP5's evidence must be accepted as there is no expert evidence to the contrary nor was her evidence undermined by cross-examination. In fact there was no challenge to her evidence that a combination of the internal injuries to the chest and abdomen were fatal and that these were the injuries that caused the deceased's death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> On these facts the learned JC found, rightly in my view that a prima facie case had been established against the appellant and he accordingly called for her defence. The appellant elected to give sworn evidence and called her stepsister (SD2) to support her case. She denied causing the deceased's death. Instead she put the blame on her husband SP12 and SP12's ex-wife as being responsible for her death. She said SP12 was a hot tempered husband who often vented his anger on her and the children. She went on to say that the deceased was a hyperactive girl who was fond of swinging about ("bergayut") in the cradle, climbing on the embankment wall in front of the house and sometimes she fell down while doing that.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> With regard to the incident on the morning of 9 January 2011 her testimony is that she had asked the deceased and her elder sister "Ecah" to take bath as she had to dry the mattress which the deceased had urinated on. She said she was sleeping while they were taking their bath. When she woke up, she went to the bathroom and saw the deceased in a sitting position and leaning against the wall while "Ecah" was still taking her bath. According to the appellant the deceased was motionless when she saw her, so she carried her to the living room. After that she went over to SP8's house to seek help.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> Without a doubt the appellant's defence was that she had nothing to do with the deceased's death as she was sleeping at the time of the incident. It was a classic defence of bare denial. She was of course suggesting that the deceased's death could be due to a fall or drowning or even the work of her husband (SP12) and his ex-wife.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> Having given very careful consideration to the defence case, the learned JC found the appellant's explanation to be baseless and without merit. In the premises he found the appellant guilty and sentenced her accordingly. Before us counsel for the appellant raised four grounds of appeal, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> It is clear that the appellant's appeal is fact based and against findings that were dependent on the credibility of the witnesses. The first ground of appeal raises the question of who actually caused the deceased's death. The second, third and fourth grounds of appeal overlap and shall be dealt with together. Basically they relate to the question of whether the learned JC had considered all relevant factors in dealing with the defence case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Perhaps it is appropriate at this juncture for me to set out what were the findings of fact that the learned JC had arrived at in this case. They are the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The question for determination in this appeal is whether, in arriving at these findings of fact, the learned JC had committed any error of law or that his findings are perverse and against all probabilities of the case. If the learned JC had not committed any error of law and his findings are in fact supported by the evidence, it is this court's duty to uphold the conviction and sentence and thereby avoid a serious miscarriage of justice in the sense that a guilty person may be acquitted of a heinous crime. The reverse would of course be true <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> An appellate court's approach in dealing with an appeal of this nature is well settled and there is sufficient adjective law on the point. Suffice for me to cite the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Powell and Wife v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home</i> [1935] AC 243 where Lord Wright said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> There can be no argument that the learned JC found the witnesses called by the prosecution to be trustworthy and credible witnesses for otherwise he would not have called for the defence. In evaluating the prosecution's evidence he had properly directed his mind to the principles laid down in the following authorities: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_2_383;"><i>Looi Kow Chai &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2002] 2 MLRA 383</LINK>; [2003] 2 MLJ 65; [2003] 1 CLJ 734; [2003] 1 AMR 89, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_2_590;"><i>PP v.

Kasmin Bin Soeb</i> [1974] 1 MLRH 108</LINK>; [1974] 1 MLJ 230.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> I shall deal with the first ground of appeal first. The contention by counsel is that there is "no admissible evidence" to prove that it was the appellant who caused the deceased's death. I must confess I am unable to comprehend what the counsel means by "no admissible evidence" in the context of the present case. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;3.;;">Section 3 of the Evidence Act 1950 ('the Evidence Act')</LINK> defines "evidence" as to include:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The word "fact" on the other hand is defined to mean and include:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Evidence to prove any fact in issue can either be direct or circumstantial. A fact is proved if, in the words of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;3.;;">s 3 of the Evidence Act</LINK> "its existence is so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act on the supposition that it exists." It is not rocket science or complicated algorithm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> In the instant case the crucial fact in issue in relation to the first ground of appeal is whether it was the appellant who inflicted the force blunt trauma to the deceased's chest and abdomen. It is these injuries that the court must focus its attention on as these were the fatal injuries that caused the deceased's death. The rest of the injuries although relevant are not determinative of the fact in issue as they were not fatal in nature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> The evidence as to who caused the fatal injuries is entirely circumstantial as no one saw who inflicted them. The question therefore is whether the circumstantial evidence is strong enough to support the learned JC's finding that it was the appellant who caused them. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1962_1_32;"><i>Chan Chwen Kong v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1962] 1 MLRA 32</LINK>; [1962] 1 MLJ 307, Thomson CJ had this to say on circumstantial evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> In the House of Lords case of <i>Belhaven &amp; Stenton Peerage</i> [1875-76] 1 App Cas 278, Lord Cairns said at p 279:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1974_1_269;"><i>Eng Sin v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1974] 1 MLRA 269</LINK>; [1974] 2 MLJ 168, Gill CJ in delivering the judgment of the Federal Court quoted with approval the following passage in <i>Martin v. Osborne</i> [1936] 55 CLR 367 at p 375:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> In finding that it was the appellant who caused the fatal chest and abdominal injuries, it is obvious that the learned JC relied on the following strands of circumstantial evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> Taken individually these strands of evidence are insufficient to tie the appellant with the death of the deceased but the united force of all the circumstances put together irresistibly and unerringly point to the appellant as the person who inflicted those fatal injuries, barring fanciful possibilities. That is the only reasonable inference that will account for all the proved facts. To quote again Lord Cairns in <i>Belhaven &amp; Stenton Peerage (supra)</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> On the evidence before him the learned JC was plainly right in my view in coming to the conclusion that it was the appellant who caused the deceased's death. The converging rays of light that bear upon the same point and producing a body of illumination had cleared away the darkness that he was endeavouring to dispel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The first ground of appeal also complains about the calling of the deceased's six year old elder sister Nur Dania Batrisya (SP13) to give evidence. She is also known as "Ecah" and was five years old at the time of the incident. It was submitted that the learned JC committed an error of law in exercising his discretion to admit the unsworn evidence of SP13. The basis of the complaint is that the preconditions for admission of such evidence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">s 133A of the Evidence Act</LINK> was never met in that the learned JC failed to enquire whether the child possessed sufficient intelligence to justify reception of her evidence. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">Section 133A</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> The precondition for the admission of such evidence is that the child witness is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify reception of his or her evidence, though not on oath. Clearly this is a matter for the trial court to ascertain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> Counsel reproduced the following excerpts from the notes of proceeding to show that SP13 did not possess sufficient intelligence to justify reception of her evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> This prompted the learned JC to make the following remarks in the midst of the enquiry:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> It is obvious that SP13 did not understand the nature of an oath. But that is precisely the situation contemplated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">s 133A of the Evidence Act</LINK>, ie that where a child witness does not understand the nature of an oath, his evidence can still be admitted if the trial court is satisfied that he is intelligent enough to understand what he is talking about on important events.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> In this regard the learned JC after hearing further questions and answers to determine the level of SP13's intelligence found her to be a competent witness, though not on oath. This is a finding that this court is loathe to interfere with without any valid reason and there is none in this case. There is therefore no merit in the counsel's submission that the learned JC had erred in exercising his discretion to admit the unsworn testimony of SP13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> The unsworn testimony of SP13 must of course be corroborated in material particulars. This is the safeguard provided by the proviso to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;133A.;;">s 133A</LINK>. But corroboration need not be direct evidence that the appellant committed the offence. It is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of her connection with the crime: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1969_1_58;"><i>Attan Bin Abdul Gani v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1969] 1 MLRH 58</LINK>; [1970] 2 MLJ 143b.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> The crucial part of SP13's unsworn evidence is that while she and the deceased were in the bathroom, the appellant immersed the deceased's head in a basin filled with water. This is corroborated by the evidence of SP8 that water came out from the deceased's mouth and nostrils when he pressed her chest. There is also the evidence of the assistant medical officer (SP9) that the deceased's hair was a bit wet when he attended to her. The fact that her hair was only a bit wet does not render SP13's evidence doubtful as it was not her evidence that the whole of the deceased's head was immersed in water. What SP13 told the court is therefore sufficient corroboration of the appellant's connection with the crime.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[90]</b> It was next argued by counsel that the evidence of SP13 is irreconcilable with the evidence of the pathologist (SP5) that the deceased's death was not due to drowning. Counsel questioned why the prosecution called SP13 to prove drowning if drowning was not the cause of death. It was argued that the fact that water came out from the deceased's mouth and nostrils corroborates the appellant's defence that the deceased died due to drowning. The short answer to this argument is that SP5 is a forensic expert whereas SP13 is not.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[91]</b> Whatever may be the probative value of SP13's unsworn testimony, it is important to bear in mind that the prosecution is not relying on her testimony alone to connect the appellant with the crime. As a matter of fact SP13 did not say anything about any assault on the deceased's chest and abdomen by the appellant. Her evidence was merely to the effect that the appellant immersed the deceased's head in a basin filled with water. Thus, even if we were to disregard SP13's evidence completely the prosecution had ample other evidence to prove that the fatal chest and abdominal injuries were caused by the appellant. [49] With regard to the second, third and fourth grounds of appeal the crux of the argument is that there were other intervening factors that could have led to the deceased's death, including infection and the acts of SP12 and his ex-wife. It was argued that the existence of these intervening factors had the effect of negating any inference that the appellant had the required intention to commit murder. As to the first line of argument it is clear as explained earlier in this judgment that the circumstantial evidence points to the appellant as the sole culprit. The contention is therefore without merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[92]</b> As for the question of intention, this is primarily a question of fact and a matter of inference. In this case the learned JC after a careful evaluation and assessment of the entire evidence found that the appellant's act of causing the "blunt force trauma to the chest and abdomen" was done intentionally. There is nothing plainly wrong with this finding of fact as it was based on actual evidence before him. I would say that he was plainly right. This and the fact that survival from these injuries was slim according to SP5 proves the element of intention beyond any reasonable doubt. The learned JC's finding in this regard is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[93]</b> It was submitted that the learned JC failed to fairly and justly appreciate the defence case. There is no substance to the argument. First of all it is abundantly clear that the learned JC had sufficiently directed his mind to the applicable principles in dealing with the defence explanation by citing <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1991_1_158;"><i>Mohamad Radhi Yaakob v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1991] 1 MLRA 158</LINK>; [1991] 3 MLJ 169; [1991] 1 CLJ (Rep) 311; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_91;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Saimin &amp; Ors</i> [1971] 1 MLRH 91</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 16; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_572;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Datuk Tan Cheng Swee &amp; Anor</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 572</LINK>; [1980] 2 MLJ 277; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_55;"><i>DA Duncan v.

    <p>
      <b>[94]</b> Having properly directed his mind to the principles, the learned JC then proceeded to recount the appellant's defence and assessed the appellant's explanation with meticulous care. He had sufficiently dealt with the most crucial aspect of the defence case, ie the appellant's claim that she did not know what happened to the deceased as she was sleeping. The learned JC did not accept her explanation and had given valid reasons for so deciding. This court should be slow to disturb such finding. This is how the learned JC rationalised his finding:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[95]</b> It was further submitted that the learned JC failed to consider inferences that the appellant could have committed other offences other than murder based on the evidence. With due respect to counsel, once the offence of murder had been established by the evidence and found proved by the learned JC there is no reason why the court should consider other offences that the appellant could have committed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[96]</b> To deflect culpability away from herself the appellant tried to shift the blame on SP12, alleging that he was a violent person, implying of course that it was SP12 who was responsible for the deceased's death. First of all no weight should be given to this allegation as it was never put to SP12 in crossexamination. The law on the point is as stated by <i>Mukharji J in AEG Carapiet v. Derderian</i> [1961] AIR Cal 359 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[97]</b> Secondly, there is no possibility that it was SP12 who inflicted those fatal injuries to the deceased's chest and abdomen. He was at his workplace when the deceased succumbed to those injuries between 6.00am and 9.00am on 9 January 2011 and the appellant was the only adult at home.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[98]</b> Thirdly, the appellant herself admitted in her evidence that SP12 loves his three children, especially the deceased. There was therefore no reason for him to cause such life ending injuries to the deceased whom he loved.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[99]</b> For all the reasons aforesaid I find that the learned JC was not wrong in finding the appellant guilty of murdering her stepdaughter as charged. In the circumstances I dismiss the appeal and uphold the conviction and sentence.</p>
