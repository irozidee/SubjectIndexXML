    <p>The appellant through a General Facility Agreement ("the first GFA") had granted the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent various banking and trade finance facilities. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> respondents guaranteed the first GFA through a Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement ("GIA"). Subsequently, the appellant increased the limit of certain other facilities for the appellant and this increase led to the execution of the second GFA, guaranteed personally by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> respondents. The appellant alleged default by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, recalled the facilities with notice and commenced action against the respondents in the High Court. However, the respondents denied the claim and contended that the appellant had breached the facility agreement first and had wrongfully terminated the facilities granted to the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent. The respondents thus counterclaimed against the appellant for general damages. The High Court found that the appellant had failed to prove that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent had breached the facilities agreement and thus the termination of the banking facilities was unlawful. The appellant's claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was therefore dismissed. Since the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was not liable for the appellant's claim, the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> respondents were likewise not liable as guarantors. The appellant's claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> respondents was also dismissed. The High Court however allowed the respondents' counterclaim against the appellant. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held,</b> allowing the appeal with costs and dismissing the respondents' counterclaim:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> A resolution of any dispute between the parties had to be by reference to the first GFA. The first GFA was the document that the parties had entered into to regulate their rights and obligations in relation to the facilities granted by the appellant to the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent. <i>Merita Merchant Bank Singapore Ltd v. Dewan Bahasa Dan Pustaka (refd)</i>. (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge had failed to consider the terms and conditions in the first GFA and the evidence before the court. From the evidence, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent had committed numerous events of default. The trial judge had erred in finding that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was not in breach of the first GFA. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The trial judge had also erred in finding that the plaintiff had wrongfully frozen the facilities and was not entitled to terminate the facilities. Clauses 6.1 and 9.3 of the first GFA allowed the appellant to refuse further utilisation of the facilities, to cancel the facilities and to terminate the first GFA, and to recall the facilities. Therefore, the appellant had rightly exercised its rights under the first GFA in recalling the facilities and terminating the first GFA. There was thus no basis for the respondents' counterclaim.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aziah Ali JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, CIMB Bank Bhd had filed a claim for breach of facility agreement against the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, VCM Precision Sdn Bhd as borrower, and against the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> respondents, who are Directors of the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, as guarantors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The claim is for the sum of RM302,044.01 and interests, being the amount due and payable as at 30 June 2007 on an overdraft facility, and the sum of RM2,105,300.44 and interests being the amount due and payable as at 30 June 2007 on a banker's acceptance facility, and penalty interests, and costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondents denied the claim and contended that the appellant was in breach of the facility agreement first and had wrongfully terminated the facility agreement. This resulted in the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent being unable to carry out its business and being unable to service the facilities granted. Therefore the respondents counterclaimed against the appellant for general damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The learned judge found that the appellant had failed to prove that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent had breached the facility agreement. Therefore the termination of the banking facilities was unlawful. The appellant's claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was therefore dismissed. Since the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was not liable for the appellant's claim, the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> respondents were, likewise, not liable as guarantors. The appellant's claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> respondents was also dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Based on the finding that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was not in default and that the appellant had prematurely and unlawfully frozen the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's banking facilities which resulted in the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent being unable to carry out its business and to service the banking facilities, the learned judge allowed the defendants' counterclaim for general damages to be assessed by the Deputy Registrar. Aggrieved by the decision, the appellant appeals to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We had allowed the appellant's appeal with costs of RM60,000.00 and dismissed the respondents' counterclaim. We set aside the order of the High Court. We entered judgment for the appellant as prayed for in para 31(a) and (b) of the amended statement of claim. The parties were ordered to calculate the actual amount due less the securities realised. We now give our reasons below. In this judgment, parties will be referred to as they were in the court below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Salient Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the application made by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiff (which at the material time was known as Bumiputra-Commerce Bank Bhd), had by way of a letter dated 18 April 2001 offered to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant two banking facilities as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 22 June 2001 the Managing Director of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Sim Teng Leng ("the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant") signed acceptance of the offer on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (pp 406-411 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 21 July 2001 the plaintiff issued a letter to amend the security arrangements. Amongst others, the plaintiff required a third party first legal charge on a factory situated in Mukim Plentong ("the charged property") and a joint and several directors' guarantee by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant and Tee Chai Ling @ Tee Hun Hin ("the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant") in their personal capacities. On 27 July 2001 the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant signed acceptance on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant (pp 655-656 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Pursuant thereto, on 19 September 2001, a General Facility Agreement ("the first GFA") was executed between the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants, as Directors of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, signed the first GFA on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. On the same date, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants also executed a Guarantee and Indemnity Agreement ("the GIA") (pp 511-528 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 11 April 2003 the plaintiff granted the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's application for additional banking facilities whereby the limit for the BA facilities was increased from RM1,500,000.00 to RM2,500,000.00. On 19 April 2003 the offer was accepted by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The increase in limit for the BA facilities led to the execution of another GFA on 9 July 2003 between the plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant ("the second GFA"). Another Director of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Chew See Meng ("the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant") and the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant signed on behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Both the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants also signed as personal guarantors (pp 574-575 Appeal Record). On the same date both the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants signed a guarantee and indemnity agreement whereby both jointly and severally guaranteed the principal sum of RM1,000,000.00 (pp 583-592 Appeal Record). In addition the plaintiff also had a lien over the sum of RM300,000.00 in the form of fixed deposit pledged by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The testimony of an officer of the plaintiff, Anis Rafidah binti Aning (PW1) illustrates how a BA works. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant will present to the plaintiff an invoice from a supplier of goods that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant wishes to buy and the plaintiff will accept the invoice and based on the invoice, the plaintiff will make payment to the supplier. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is obliged to repay the plaintiff the amount released to the supplier within the maturity period. In the present case the maturity period is 150 days from the date of issuance of the BA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The plaintiff alleges that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had committed an act of default. In para 24 of the amended statement of claim, the plaintiff pleads that 12 BAs which had matured from 22 September 2006 until 29 December 2006 had not been paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The principal amount owing under these 12 BAs is RM1,993,018.47 plus interests of RM112,281.97 as at 30 June 2007.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In the course of the trial, the learned judge allowed the plaintiff 's application to amend the statement of claim whereby para 25A was added to include a claim for RM203,000.00 on BAs which became due for payment on 1 September 2006 and 15 September 2006 respectively. The learned judge was of the view that the amendment would not take the defendants by surprise as it was the defendants themselves, through the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (DW1), who had adduced evidence of the plaintiff 's letter dated 20 September 2006 (exh K-57 at p 661 Appeal Record) informing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant that it has committed a breach of cl 16.1(f) of the first GFA by failing to pay RM203,000.00 due under the BAs upon maturity on 1 September 2006 and 15 September 2006, and the said letter was let in as evidence without objection. The defendants had also cross-examined on the letter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Pursuant to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's failure to pay the amounts outstanding, notices of demand dated 12 February 2007 were issued through the plaintiff's solicitors to the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants (pp 594-602 Appeal Record). Upon failure by the defendants to make payment, notices of recall of the facilities dated 21 March 2007 were issued by the plaintiff's solicitors (pp 603-611 Appeal Record). The plaintiff then commenced this action against the defendants. The defendants' defence to the claim is that the plaintiff has unlawfully frozen their BA facilities which caused the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to be unable to service the facility and causing the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to be unable to settle the BA as and when they matured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned judge found that the plaintiff was in breach of the first GFA in wrongfully freezing the banking facilities on 29 August 2006. The learned judge found that the termination of the GFA was unlawful for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the learned judge had erred in finding that the plaintiff had failed to prove its claim against the defendants. He submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had defaulted in paying the BAs pleaded in paras 24 and 25A of the amended statement of claim despite the letters of demand dated 12 February 2007 and 21 March 2007. In his written submissions, the learned counsel submitted that the learned judge had failed to refer to the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Further, learned counsel referred to the testimony of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant (DW1) who had admitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had not settled all the BAs stated in the amended statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_1_182;"><i>Merita Merchant Bank Singapore Ltd v. Dewan Bahasa Dan Pustaka</i> [2015] 1 MLRA 182</LINK>; [2014] 9 CLJ 1064; [2015] 1 AMR 575, Raus Sharif PCA said, amongst others, that it was a wellestablished principle sanctioned by the doctrine of sanctity of contract that parties who make agreement must adhere to their terms. Hence adopting the said principle, a resolution of any dispute between the parties herein must necessarily be by reference to the first GFA. The first GFA is the document that the parties had entered into to regulate their rights and obligations in relation to the facilities granted by the plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The first GFA provides, amongst others, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Clause 16 of the first GFA provides for events of default. Clause 16.1(a) states, amongst others, as follows:</p>
    <p>16.1 Events</p>
    <p>If:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>then, once or at any time thereafter, the bank may, by notice to the Borrower, declare the facilities to be immediately due and payable whereupon:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Clause 1.1 of the first GFA defines 'Security Party' as "the borrower, the Guarantors, the chargor and any party from time to time providing security to the bank for the obligations and liabilities of the borrower under this agreement and the Security Documents and references to 'Security Party' include references to any of them;" and, 'Transaction Documents' is defined as "this agreement and the Security Documents;".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We have perused the testimony of DW1, the sole witness for the defendants, which shows that DW1, in cross-examination, had agreed that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had not paid RM203,000.00 due under two BAs which had matured on 1 September 2006 and 15 September 2006. DW1 also agreed that as at 22 September 2006 the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant owed a total of RM380,728.86 for three BAs consisting of the principal sum of RM379,000.00 and interests of RM1,728.86 (p 662 Appeal Record). DW1 further agreed that as at 3 November 2006 the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant owed the plaintiff a total of RM1,119,144.75 consisting of the principal amount of RM1,112,000.00 and interests of RM7,144.75 for seven BAs which had matured from 1 September 2006 until 3 November 2006 (p 663 Appeal Record). DW1 also agreed that as at 24 November 2006 the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant owed the plaintiff a total of RM1,468,869.76 in respect of nine BAs which had matured from 1 September 2006 until 24 November 2006 (p 664 Appeal Record).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The words of cl 16.1(a) indicate that each BA remaining unpaid when payment is due amounts to an event of default. Based on the admission made by DW1, it is clear that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had committed numerous events of default.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The defendants contended that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was unable to settle the BAs as and when they matured because the plaintiff had unlawfully frozen the facilities. The plaintiff on the other hand denied the allegation. The learned judge found that the plaintiff has breached the first GFA by wrongfully freezing the facilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that the learned judge had failed to analyse the evidence and had erred in finding that the plaintiff had frozen the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's facilities. Learned counsel submitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's BA was not frozen as alleged. Rather the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was not allowed to utilise the facility because of non-payment of BAs which had already matured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> According to PW1, the plaintiff froze only the BA facilities but not the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's OD facilities. PW1 states that in August 2006, that is to say, prior to the issuance of the letters of demand by the plaintiff's solicitors, the plaintiff had stopped the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's BA facilities and did not allow further drawdown because of non-payment of sums due under the BA facility. The plaintiff also did not allow the BA facility to be utilised to refinance invoices of companies which are also the plaintiff's customers but with problem accounts. Another officer of the plaintiff, Zailan bin Yahya (PW2), testified that for such cases approval from a higher level was required. If approval was denied, then the customer could not utilise the BA facility. On 29 August 2006 the plaintiff rejected the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's application to utilise the BA facility to pay a sale invoice issued by a company known as Lension (M) Sdn Bhd ("Lension"). According to PW1, Lension is also a customer of the plaintiff but had not serviced its loans with the plaintiff. PW1 states that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant's accounts were frozen from 20 September 2006, ie the date of the plaintiff's letter to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant notifying the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant amongst others that its account was now under the purview of Corporate Recovery Department.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Clause 16.1(a)(ii) specifically allows the plaintiff to refuse further utilisation of the facilities where there is non-payment of any amount due under the facilities, which is an event of default. Further cl 9.3 allows the plaintiff to cancel any of the facilities at the plaintiff 's sole and absolute discretion without assigning any reason. Clause 9.3 states amongst others as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We have perused the grounds of judgment of the learned judge and we agree with the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the learned judge had failed to consider the terms and conditions in the first GFA and the evidence before the court. We find from the evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had committed numerous events of default. The learned judge had erred in finding that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was not in breach of the first GFA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The learned judge had also erred in finding that the plaintiff had wrongfully frozen the facilities and was not entitled to terminate the facilities. We find that cls 6.1 and 9.3 of the first GFA allow the plaintiff to refuse further utilisation of the facilities, to cancel the facilities and to terminate the first GFA, and to recall the facilities. Therefore we are of the view that the plaintiff had rightly exercised its rights under the first GFA in recalling the facilities and terminating the first GFA. Hence we find no basis for the defendants' counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> For the reasons stated above, we allowed the plaintiff 's claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as borrower and against the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants as guarantors and we dismissed the counterclaim.</p>
