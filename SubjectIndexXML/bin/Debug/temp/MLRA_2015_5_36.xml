    <p>The appellant - the local planning authority - was empowered under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;22.;;">s 22 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 ("TCPA")</LINK> to consider applications for planning permission within its administrative area. Lot 847, held under a freehold title with an express condition for "Medium Industry" within the land use category of "Enterprise/Industry", was located within the administrative area of the appellant. Under the Local Plan Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya 2020 agreed to by the State Authority and gazetted on 27 May 2010, Lot 847 was zoned "Industrial" which could be used for "commercial purposes". In July 2011, an application was made by the registered proprietor of Lot 847 under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;124.;;">s 124(1)(a) and (c) of the National Land Code 1965 ("NLC")</LINK> to the Land Administrator to convert the land use category of Lot 847 from "Industrial" to "Building" and the express condition from "Medium Industry" to "Business". By a letter dated 15 August 2011, the appellant had no objections to the change of use to "Commercial". On 21 December 2011, the State Authority approved the application for conversion of Lot 847 to "Building" with the express condition "Commercial Building" pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;124.;;">s 124(1)(a), (c) NLC</LINK> and subject to, <i>inter alia</i>, compliance with policies and guidelines of the State Planning Committee and the Local Planning Authority. On 20 April 2012, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent under a power of attorney from the registered proprietor applied for planning permission to construct two 23-storey Commercial "Service Apartments", Shop Offices and Facilities. The appellant dismissed the application on the basis that the commercial activity of "service apartments" was not consistent with the surrounding land usage and the commercial activity allowed was commercial activity to support the existing industrial area. The Appeal Board dismissed an appeal by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, which then sought and obtained from the High Court orders of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the decision and <i>mandamus</i> to compel the Appeal Board to reconsider the appeal. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>

      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court failed to take into consideration that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC was enacted in 1965</LINK> while the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA was enacted in 1976</LINK>.

On the contrary, Parliament being aware of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC it passed in 1965</LINK>, the approach to interpretation must be: (a) Parliament intended that the TCPA be read consistent with the NLC; and if not possible (b) the TCPA, as the later legislation would prevail.

    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The submission that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">s 108 of the NLC</LINK> rendered the TCPA and zoning thereunder inconsistent with land use under the NLC titles null and void, held no merit. (para 19)</p>

      <b>(3)</b> Applying the term "commercial building" in the title to allow a commercial building that accords with the existing industrial zoning is a reasonable rationalisation that the local planning authority is entitled to make to ensure adherence to the planning objectives as approved, and the Appeal Board was not unreasonable to have rejected the appeal.

      <b>(5)</b> Procedural impropriety and proportionality did not arise in the instant case. There was no illegality as against <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">s 108 of the NLC</LINK>.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya appealed against the decision of the High Court to issue:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Lot 847 is located within the administrative area of the appellant. It is the local planning authority that, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;22.;;">s 22 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 ("TCPA")</LINK>, is empowered to consider applications for planning permission within its administrative area.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The title document issued under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code ("the NLC")</LINK> in respect of Lot 847 shows it is a freehold title with the express condition that it is for "Industri Sederhana" within the land use category of "Perusahaan/ Industry".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Under the Local Plan Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya 2020 ("the Local Plan MPSJ 2020") agreed to by the State Authority and which assent was gazetted in the Government Gazette of the State of Selangor, Gazette No 1566 on 27 May 2010, Lot 847 was zoned "Perindustrian" which may be used for "commercial purposes".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 8 July 2011, an application was made by the registered proprietor under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;124.;;">s 124(1)(a) and (c) of the NLC</LINK> to the Land Administrator Petaling, to convert the land use category of Lot 847 from "Perindustrian" to "Bangunan" and the Express Condition from "Industri Sederhana" to "Perniagaan". By a letter dated 15 August 2011, the appellant had no objections to change of use to "Komersial". On 21 December 2011, the State Authority approved the application for conversion of Lot 847 to "Building" with the express condition "Commercial Building" pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?;124.;;">s 124(1)(a), (c) NLC</LINK> and subject to, <i>inter alia</i>, compliance with policies and guidelines of the State Planning Committee and the Local Planning Authority. This was notified by letters by the Pejabat Daerah dan Tanah Petaling dated 25 January 2012 and 15 March 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> On 20 April 2012, an application for planning permission was made by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent under a power of attorney from the registered proprietor, to construct two Blocks of Commercial 'Service Apartment' containing:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> By a letter dated 30 May 2012, the appellant notified the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent that its application was rejected by the appellant at its meeting on 22 May 2012 on the grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The Appeal Board dismissed an appeal by the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent against that decision. The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent sought and obtained from the High Court an order of <i>certiorari</i> to quash the decision of the Appeal Board and an order of <i>mandamus</i> to the Appeal Board to reconsider the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent's appeal thereat. The appellant appealed to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The High Court had adopted the arguments for the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> At para 27 of its grounds of judgment, the High Court summed up the argument for the appellant as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We appreciate the distaste at the level of the superior courts that "applicant did not raise the issue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">s 108 NLC</LINK> in the Notice of Appeal". Given that every person is deemed to know the law, and ignorance of the law is no defence, the argument that a point of law was not raised earlier, without more, holds no merit. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909. It is an objection that applies where there are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Otherwise such argument not only cannot be accepted as a submission, but also, sounding petulant, has the effect of tainting the other submissions raised to its level. It left the High Court to the consideration of the law on interpretation of statutes and purposive interpretation (paras 28, 29, 30), conflict between the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> and any restriction imposed by the local authority or local planning authority (para 31 and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;104.;;">ss 104</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">108 NLC</LINK>), and the meaning of the word "restriction", leading the High Court to hold:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The High Court then referred to two cases in the High Court. However, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1970_1_382;"><i>Datin Siti Hajar v. Murugasu</i> [1970] 1 MLRH 382</LINK>; [1970] 2 MLJ 153 did not concern <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">s 108 but only the NLC</LINK> generally, and the complete paragraph reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Despite the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> is a complete Code in itself as regards the subjects it deals with, it can be amended and the interpretation is based upon what is found in the Code as amended.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_5_647;"><i>Venkateswara Sdn Bhd v. Datuk Bandar Kuala Lumpur</i> [2001] 5 MLRH 647</LINK>; [2002] 8 CLJ 997, the High Court was concerned with whether the local authority had exceeded its powers and acted unreasonably and did not directly make the proposition that where there is a conflict between the provisions of the NLC and local planning laws, the provisions of the NLC shall prevail.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The High Court in the instant case was correct in appreciating that the decisions of MPSJ and the Appeal Board were predicated upon the finding that the proposed development was incompatible with the MPSJ Local Plan. It concluded:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In so doing the High Court failed to take into consideration that the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC was enacted in 1965</LINK> while the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA was enacted in 1976</LINK>. Parliament cannot be held to be ignorant of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC enacted in 1965</LINK>. On the contrary, Parliament being aware of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC it passed in 1965</LINK>, the approach to interpretation must be:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The NLC provided in general terms for land use for agriculture, building, and industry. Conditions in individual titles are too cumbersome a means for the purpose of planning development. Before the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>, a large number of land titles had been issued. There were other laws and bye-laws. It is to these that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">s 108</LINK> was directed. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">Section 108</LINK>, however, cannot apply to laws passed subsequently by Parliament and regulations authorised thereunder.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We, therefore, hold the submission that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">s 108</LINK> renders the TCPA and zoning thereunder inconsistent with land use under the NLC titles null and void holds no merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA</LINK> provided specifically for the proper control and regulation of town and country planning in Peninsular Malaysia and for purposes connected therewith or ancillary thereto. While the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> addresses land use in individual titles, the TCPA addresses planning by land use zones. By the time the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA</LINK> was promulgated, large numbers of land titles had been issued, with condition of use as often as not that differs from the zoning. For planned development to succeed, obviously if the condition of use in the title is in conflict with the zoning, the condition is almost routinely amended to the use authorised by the zoning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We note that the Pejabat Daerah dan Tanah Petaling had by its letter of 25 January 2012 notified that "Syarat-syarat terperinci dan notis 7G akan dikemukakan kemudian setelah mendapat nilaian tanah daripada Jabatan Penilaian Dan Perkhidmatan Harta Negeri Selangor." By its letter of 15 March 2012, the Pejabat Daerah dan Tanah Petaling set out the terms <i>inter alia</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Quite clearly while a change of use was allowed, it was expected that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent complies with the Local Plan MPSJ 2020 and requirements of the planning authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The conditions by the Pejabat Daerah dan Tanah Petaling reflect the experience that a condition of use in the title for industry allows buildings for industry, but in such a case the emphasis must necessarily be industry. The letter dated 15 March 2012 allowed a change from medium industry to "commercial building". There are many types of commercial buildings, some consistent with and others not consistent with the zoning of the area the land is located in. The use allowed in the title under the NLC must be read so as to be consistent with the zoned use of the area the land is located in. A commercial building in a local area planned or zoned for industry must necessarily be a commercial building consistent with serving industry. To accept otherwise would be to flout the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_172;;">TCPA</LINK> and the Local Plan MPSJ 2020.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We would accept that a commercial service apartment is a commercial building. But land use in a title is quite another matter from the plan or zoning for industry. Applying the term "commercial building" in the title to allow commercial building that accords with the existing industrial zoning is a reasonable rationalisation that the local planning authority is entitled to make, to ensure adherence to the planning objectives as approved, and the Appeal Board was not unreasonable to have rejected the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The application in this case was made under the supervisory jurisdiction of judicial review. Time and again the courts have referred to <i>Council of Civil Service Unions and Ors v. Minister for the Civil Service</i> [1985] 1 AC 374 that judicial review is not to interfere but to intervene where there is illegality, procedural impropriety or irrationality and possibly proportionality.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Procedural impropriety and proportionality did not arise in this case. As we have set out above, there is no illegality as against <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;108.;;">s 108 of the NLC</LINK>. We find no irrationality nor lack of proportionality in the decision of the appellant and the Appeal Board. In the circumstances, there was no reason to intervene.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Accordingly, we had allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the High Court, fixed costs in the sum of RM20,000.00 here and below and ordered the deposit be refunded.</p>
