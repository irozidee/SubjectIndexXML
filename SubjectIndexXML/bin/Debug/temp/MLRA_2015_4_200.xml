    <p>The appellant was an advocate and solicitor and his firm had been appointed by the respondent to act in two matters. He was paid RM50,000 as professional fees for the conduct of both matters. On the appellant's advice, the respondent forwarded to the appellant's firm a sum of RM250,000 to be held by the appellant as stakeholder, for the purpose of applying for a stay of execution in one of the matters the appellant had been engaged to act in. However, the application was subsequently dismissed both in the High Court and Court of Appeal. The respondent thereafter demanded the return of the RM250,000 but the appellant refused to release the same. On 4 August 2010, the respondent lodged a report with the Disciplinary Board ("DB"), which sought and obtained a written explanation from the appellant. A Disciplinary Committee ("DC") held a hearing on 14 July 2011 where although the appellant was given the opportunity to be heard, he failed to participate in the said hearing. On 9 September 2011, the DB acting on the findings and recommendations of the DC, ordered the appellant to refund the respondent the RM250,000 within three months of the order; and ordered the appellant be struck off the Roll of Advocates and Solicitors ("Roll") within 21 days from the date of the order. The respondent commenced civil proceedings against the appellant for the return of the RM250,000 and eventually had the appellant declared a bankrupt on 10 July 2014. On 9 September 2014, the appellant was discharged as a bankrupt after paying the Insolvency Department a sum of RM281,271.14. The appellant only filed an appeal against the order of the DB (dated 9 September 2011) on 11 December 2013 - two years and three months from the date of the order, thus failing to comply with the time limit for appeals under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103E.;;">s 103E of the Legal Profession Act 1976 ("the Act")</LINK>. By Notice of Motion dated 31 March 2014, the appellant applied for condonation of non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103E.;;">s 103E of the Act</LINK>. By order dated 23 July 2014, the High Court struck out the appellant's appeal with costs. Further, his Motion to extend time was also dismissed with costs. The appellant thus filed two appeals to the Court of Appeal. The first appeal concerned the order striking out his appeal and the second appeal was against the dismissal of the application for condonation of non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103E.;;">s 103E of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing both appeals with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> When an appellant allows time to file a notice of appeal to go by, his position suffers a radical change. Whereas previously he was in a position to appeal as of right; he now becomes an applicant for a grant of indulgence by the court. (para 33)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The power to extend time to file a notice of appeal is discretionary and has to be exercised judicially having regard to established principles. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellant failed to furnish any relevant evidence to explain the delay in filing a notice of appeal within the time limit prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103.;;">s 103(E) of the Act</LINK>. The facts deposed in the affidavit in support had no bearing at all on the issue of delay. There was no attempt by the appellant to give any explanation why the rule was not adhered to. This court would agree with the trial judge that the facts deposed in the affidavit in support of the notice of motion were not materially relevant to explain the reason for the delay in filing the notice of appeal. (paras 37-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> A party seeking condonation, must, firstly offer an explanation for the delay in order for the court to understand fully how that non-compliance occurred; and secondly, show that the explanation so offered is <i>bona fide</i> and not unfounded. However, more importantly, when the failure to comply with the rules of the court has been flagrant and gross, condonation will not be granted, regardless of the prospects of success on the merits of the case. (para 39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Rules are there to be obeyed and the court may only in exceptional circumstances use its discretionary powers to exempt a party from complying with the rules. The party applying for an exemption is under a duty to offer cogent and/or reasonable explanations without which the court shall not use its discretion. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> In the instant appeals, there was no material upon which the court could exercise its discretion to extend the time for the appellant to file a notice of appeal. The appellant had failed to demonstrate that he ought to be granted an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. The second appeal ought to be dismissed with costs. (para 44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> The appellant had not been able to point to any error of principle, nor to any matter which the DC wrongly took into account, or wrongly failed to take into account, nor had he been able to show that the DC's decision was plainly wrong. There was therefore no basis for interfering with the DC's finding which was accepted by the DB. (para 47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The appellant was given ample opportunity to be present at the hearing and have the benefit of cross-examining the complainant and his witnesses but he refused to do so. Therefore, the appellant could not be heard to say that the DC denied him a fair hearing since he chose to stay away from the proceedings. Thus the second appeal would have only a fanciful chance of success because there were no grounds upon which the DB order could be quashed. Even if there were reasonable prospects of success on the merits, that would not necessarily be decisive because in the instant appeals there had been a flagrant breach of the rules and there was no acceptable explanation for the breach. (paras 49-51)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> When an appellant fails to satisfy the court as to the reasons for the delay, the court is not obliged to go further for two reasons. Firstly, because it would place an applicant who has been lax in regard to time limits and who has failed to have the delay excused on par with an appellant who has complied with such time limits. Secondly, should the court go further looking for other criteria to grant an extension of time, that would be contrary to the intention of the legislation which had thought it fit to set down time limits. (para 52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> It is not the function of the court to assess the actual merits but only to see whether <i>prima facie</i> it is obvious that the appeal is unmeritorious or wholly unlikely to succeed. The important point is whether there is a serious question for adjudication as opposed to it being frivolous or vexatious. (para 54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> In the instant appeals, the striking-off the Roll meted out to the appellant by the DB was appropriate punishment in the circumstances of the instant case. Whatever sympathy the court might have shown for the appellant must yield to the more important principle that a flagrant disregard for the court rules should not be countenanced.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Zawawi Salleh JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The following two appeals, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>are fixed to be heard together.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The first appeal is an appeal by the appellant against the High Court order dated 23 July 2014 in which the appellant's appeal against the order of the Advocates and Solicitors' Disciplinary Board dated 9 September 2011 (the DB Order) was struck out with costs to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The second appeal is the appellant's appeal against the High Court order dated 23 July 2014 in which the appellant's Notice of Motion dated 31 March 2014 (encl 22) seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, an extension of time to file his appeal against the DB Order, was dismissed with costs to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In the meantime, however, the appellant had filed separate Notices of Motion in both appeals (encl 5a), seeking the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In essence, the Notices of Motion sought to add Majlis Peguam Malaysia (The Bar Council) as one of the parties to both appeals. The Bar Council was made an intervener at the High Court pursuant to an order dated 9 July 2014 but the Bar Council was not named as one of the parties to both appeals by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The respondent and the intervener did not oppose the granting of the orders prayed for in encl 5a and agreed that the appeals be heard on their merits. Accordingly, the court allowed the Notices of Motion with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Factual Antecedents</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> A brief advertence to the factual antecedents is necessary to put these appeals in their proper perspective. We would like to mention that the factual antecedents are taken from the appellant's and the intervener's written submissions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant was formerly an Advocate and Solicitor and was practising under the name and style of Messrs SBS Maniam &amp; Azizan (the legal firm).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The respondent was formerly a Director and shareholder of companies known as Teratak Kristal Sdn Bhd and Cheri Catering Sdn Bhd (the companies).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The legal firm was appointed by the respondent as the solicitor of the companies to act in the following matters:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In or around January 2010, the respondent gave instructions to the appellant to take over conduct of the first matter from the previous solicitors, Messrs A J Ariffin, Yeo &amp; Harpal (AYH). In respect of the first matter, a summary judgment had already been entered against Teratak Kristal Sdn Bhd when AYH was still on record.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> For the conduct of both matters, the appellant was paid a sum of RM50,000.00 in respect of his professional fees and disbursements.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The gist of the respondent's complaint to the DB is that on the appellant's advice, the respondent had forwarded to the legal firm a sum of RM250,000.00 vide a letter dated 2 February 2010 enclosing a CIMB Banker's cheque No 388850 dated 2 February 2010 to be held by the appellant as stakeholder in the appellant client's account for the purpose of stay of execution applications for the first matter. However, the stay of execution applications in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal were dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Subsequently, the respondent requested for the sum of RM250,000.00 to be returned to him. Despite the respondent's repeated demands for the money to be returned, the appellant had failed to release the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> On 4 August 2010, the respondent lodged a complaint against the appellant with the DB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Via a letter dated 29 September 2010 from the DB to the appellant, the DB sought a written explanation from the appellant. On 14 October 2010, the appellant sent a letter of explanation to the DB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant was afforded the opportunity to be heard during the hearing held on 14 July 2011 by the Disciplinary Committee ("DC"). However, the appellant chose not to participate in the hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The DB affirmed the findings of liability and recommendation on punishment by the DC. On 9 September 2012, the DB ordered the appellant to refund the sum of RM250,000.00 to the complainant/respondent within three months from the date of the order. The DB further ordered that the appellant be struck-off the Roll of Advocates and Solicitors of the High Court of Malaya to take effect within 21 days from the date of the order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Thereafter, the respondent made a demand for the said RM250,000.00 vide the respondent's solicitors' letter dated 23 November 2011. However, the appellant still failed and/or refused to return the money.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In February 2012, the respondent instituted an action against the appellant vide Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court Summons No: 52-3863-02-2012 for the return of the sum of RM250,000.00 as ordered by the DB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The respondent then filed an application for summary judgment and on 27 July 2012, the Sessions Court granted judgment against the appellant and ordered the appellant to pay the respondent the sum of RM250,000.00 with 4% interest per annum from 2 February 2010 until full settlement together with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The appellant's application to set aside the said judgment and for the stay of execution in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court Summon No: 52-3863-02-2012 had also been dismissed on 14 March 2014. Therefore, the judgment is a valid and enforceable judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The respondent then commenced bankruptcy proceedings against the appellant vide Bankruptcy Petition No: 29-6925-12-2012 since the appellant refused to comply with the judgment dated 27 July 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Subsequently, the appellant filed two applications in December 2013 to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice and the Creditor's Petition and another application to disqualify Messrs George Varughese from representing the respondent. Both the said applications had been dismissed on 22 April 2014.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> On 10 July 2014, the court granted Adjudication and Receiving Orders against the appellant and the appellant was declared as a bankrupt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Subsequently, vide the appellant's application to discharge as a bankrupt on 9 September 2014, the court discharged the appellant as a bankrupt since the appellant had paid to the Insolvency Department the judgment sum claimed by the respondent in Creditor's Petition amounting to RM281,271.14.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> For the sake of avoiding a piecemeal consideration of the matter, we allowed all the parties' counsel to proceed and present their arguments on both appeals. At the end of the hearing, if the court finds against the appellant in the second appeal, that will mark the end of the matter and the first appeal, will, in that event, fall to be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Second Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> As already stated, this is the appellant's appeal against the High Court order dismissing his application for condonation of non-compliance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103.;;">s 103(E) of the Legal Profession Act 1976 (Act 166)</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> It is a common ground that the appellant only filed an appeal against the order of the DB dated 9 September 2011 on 11 December 2013; two years and three months from the date that he received the said order. Therefore, the appellant had clearly failed to comply with the timelines for appeal as provided under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103.;;">s 103(E) of Act 166</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> During the course of argument, it was conceded by learned counsel for the appellant that there had been inordinate delay in the matter. However, learned counsel submitted that the justice of case required that the notices of motion should be granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Learned counsel posited that the appellant's appeal has a good prospect of success. The appellant should not be denied or deprived of his opportunity to have his appeal be determined on its merits because of procedural default. It has often been said that, in pursuit of justice, procedure is a servant and not a master.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Learned counsel for the respondent and intervener stoutly resisted the motion. They argued that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Analysis And Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> At the outset, it should be emphasised that when the appellant allows the time to file a notice of appeal to go by, his positon suffers a radical change. Whereas previously he was in a positon to appeal as of right; he now becomes an applicant for a grant of indulgence by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The power to extend the time to file a notice of appeal is discretionary, and has to be exercised judicially, having regard to established principles. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_146;"><i>Soh Keng Hian v. American International Assurance Co Ltd</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 146</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 191; [1996] 2 CLJ 449; [1996] 1 AMR 860, Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was), in delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 147:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The principles governing the grant of leave to file a notice of appeal out of time may be summarised as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The above factors may not necessarily be exhaustive, but they are certainly convenient yardsticks to assess the merits of an application for extension of time to file a notice appeal. Ultimately, it is for the court to uphold its own rules, while always endeavouring to avoid or redress any injustice that might result from the strict application of the rules of court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reasons For The Delay</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> We have carefully scrutinised the affidavit in support of notices of motion and we find the appellant failed to furnish any relevant evidence to explain for the delay in filing a notice of appeal within the time limit prescribed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1976_166;103.;;">s 103(E) of Act 166</LINK>. The facts deposed in the affidavit in support have no bearing at all on the issue of delay. There was no attempt by the appellant to give any explanation why the rule was not adhered to.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In this respect, we agree with the view of the learned trial judge that the facts deposed in the affidavit in support of the notices of motion are not materially relevant to explain the reason for the delay in filing a notice of appeal. At para 18 of the judgment, the learned trial judge observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We must emphasise that an application for condonation of non-observance of the rules of the court is by no means a mere formality. A full and detailed account of the causes of the delay and effect thereof must be furnished by an applicant. Therefore, a party seeking condonation, must, firstly offer an explanation for the delay in order for the court to understand fully how that non-compliance occurred; and secondly, show that the explanation so offered is <i>bona fide</i> and not unfounded. However, more importantly, when the failure to comply with the rules of the court has been flagrant and gross, condonation will not be granted, regardless of the prospects of success on the merit of the case of the party seeking condonation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The following passage from <i>Ratnam v. Comaraswamy and Others (supra)</i>, is very much relevant to the present application:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> In <i>Revici v. Prentice Hall Incorporated and Others (supra)</i>, Lord Edmund Davies LJ said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In that case Lord Denning MR dealt with the issue of delay and noncompliance with rules as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Having considered the underlying principles on granting an extension for leave to appeal out of time, we conclude that rules are there to be obeyed and only in exceptional circumstances the court can use its discretionary powers to exempt a party from complying with rules. Hence, the party so applying for an exemption is under a duty to offer cogent and/or reasonable explanation without which the court shall not use its discretion. </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In these instant appeals, there is no material on which the court can exercise its discretion to extend the time for the appellant to file a notice of appeal. The appellant has failed to demonstrate that he ought to be granted an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. We therefore, dismiss the second appeal, with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Chances Of The Appeal Succeeding If The Time Is Extended</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The appellant has raised several grounds as being meritorious and substantive for the court to consider should leave be granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Elaborating on this, learned counsel sought to demonstrate that the DC has failed to consider the following material facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> With respect, we disagree with the submission. A reading of the DC's report reveals that the DC had considered and evaluated all the relevant evidence adduced during the hearing. The factual findings and legal conclusions of the DC were amply supported by the credible evidence. The appellant has not been able to point to any error of principle, nor to any matter which the DC wrongly took into account, or wrongly failed to take into account, nor has it been able to show that the DC's decision was plainly wrong. There is, therefore, no basis for interfering with the DC's finding which was accepted by the DB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The DC found that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> We are satisfied that the appellant was given ample opportunity to be present at the hearing and have the benefit of cross-examining the complainant and his witnesses but he refused to do so. Therefore, the appellant cannot be heard to say that he was denied a fair hearing by the DC since he chose to stay away from the proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the second appeal would have only a fanciful chance of success because there are no grounds upon which the DB order could be quashed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> Assuming for the sake of argument that there are reasonable prospects of success on the merits, that would not necessarily be decisive because in these instant appeals there has been a flagrant breach of the rules of the court and there is no acceptable explanation for it. Therefore, the motion should not be granted whatever the prospects of success may be.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Before we conclude, a pertinent question to be asked is this: where an appellant fails to satisfy the court as to the reasons for the delay, is the court obliged to go further? Our view is that the court ought to go only thus far and no further for two reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In <i>R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2014] EWCA Civ 1633, the court had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> In our view, it is not the function of the court to assess the actual merits but only to see whether <i>prima facie</i> it is obvious that the appeal is unmeritorious or wholly unlikely to succeed. The important point being as to whether there is a serious question for adjudication as opposed to it being frivolous or vexatious.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> We leave to the Federal Court to deal with that matter in the future.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The only question that remains to be considered is the punishment meted out to the appellant. We are of the opinion that the striking-off of the Roll of Advocates and Solicitors of the High Court Malaya meted out to the appellant by the DB is appropriate punishment in the circumstances of this case. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_2_433;"><i>Bar Malaysia v. Mohd Fadli Shuib &amp; Anor</i> [2015] 2 MLRA 433</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> It is to be emphasised that the procedural requirements of the rules on appeal are not trivial technicalities that can be ignored. Indeed, non-compliance with the rules cannot be tolerated. The rationale for this strict approach is not difficult to appreciate. These rules are designed to facilitate the orderly disposition of appealed cases. As has been said time and time again, litigants ignore the rules and court's orders at their peril.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> We adopt the view that whatever sympathy the court might have shown for the appellant must yield to the more important principle that a flagrant disregard for the court's rules should not be countenanced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> All in all, we would dismiss the second appeal. Since there would be no competent appeal before us, the first appeal should also be dismissed. We award costs to the respondent in the sum of RM10,000 in respect of both appeals. The deposits to be refunded.</p>
