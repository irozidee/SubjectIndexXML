    <p>This case concerned the appellants' appeal against the decisions of the trial judge in allowing the respondents' striking out applications to strike out the writ and amended statement of claim of the appellants for eight separate applications for tort of conspiracy to cause injury by unlawful means which were heard together and delivered in one written judgment. In this instance, the appellants only filed one notice of appeal against the findings of the trial judge. Accordingly, when the appeal came up for hearing, the 1st-7th respondents ('the respondents') filed separate notices of motion to have the appeal struck out on the ground that the notice of appeal was bad in law and contended that as the decision of the trial judge encompassed separate applications, the appellants had to file a notice of appeal for each application they were appealing against. On the other hand, the appellants contended that even though the hearing before the High Court involved separate applications by different respondents, the hearing of the matter took place simultaneously and the judgment of the High Court was embodied in one single written grounds of decision and hence, a single notice of appeal encompassing all the orders made was perfectly in order. Therefore, the main issue to be decided was whether the notice of appeal filed by the appellants was bad in law and should be struck out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was a statutory requirement that the notice of appeal must be in the prescribed Form 1 as per <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;5.;;">r 5(3) of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994 ('RCA')</LINK>. The RCA envisaged two situations: one where a dissatisfied party appealed against one decision and second, where a dissatisfied party appealed against more than one decision. Where the appeal was against one decision involving a single respondent or involving more than one respondent in a joint action, it would be in order for the appellant to state in a single notice of appeal that he was appealing against "the whole of the said decision" without setting out the details of the decision appealed against. However, where the appeal was against more than one decision arising from separate interlocutory applications made by different parties to the action, it was incumbent on the appellants to set out the details of the decisions in the notice of appeal. (paras 11-14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant appeal, since more than one decision was given by the High Court arising from separate and distinct applications, it was imperative for the appellants to set out the details of each and every one of the decisions that they were appealing against. It was not sufficient for the appellants to state in general terms in a single notice of appeal that their appeal was against "the whole of the said decision" (in the singular) without specifying the particulars of the decisions appealed against. Likewise, a general reference to "the Orderin- Terms of all the defendants' applications to strike out" was not sufficient compliance with the statutory requirement to set out the details. It was wrong and misleading for the appellants to refer to the decisions as being a "decision" against "all" the defendants when this was not a joint application by the respondents. (paras 15-16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The notice of appeal in the instant case did not convey with sufficient clarity which particular decision favouring which particular respondent, the appellants were appealing against. This made the notice bad for ambiguity and uncertainty. Here, the defect in the notice of appeal was fatal and could not be cured by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;1A.;;">O 1A of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. What the appellants should have done was either to file separate notices of appeal or alternatively to file one notice of appeal but setting out the details of each decision appealed against. Neither was done by the appellants. (paras 30-31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> Given the factual matrix of the case, the objections raised by the respondents to the notice of appeal could not be trivialised as being mere procedural or technical acrobatics. It went to the jurisdiction of the court. The objections raised were premised on a statutory requirement, a condition precedent to this court entertaining the appeal and not a mere irregularity that could be waived. (para 32)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is our common judgment in respect of all eight applications filed by the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In the High Court at Kuala Lumpur, the appellants filed a civil suit against the respondents for the tort of conspiracy to cause injury by unlawful means. For the record, the 1st respondent is the serving Prime Minister of Malaysia whilst the 2nd respondent is his wife.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondents who were represented by seven different sets of lawyers filed eight separate applications to strike out the suit on the common ground that the writ and amended statement of claim did not disclose any reasonable cause of action, were scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and/or an abuse of the court process. All eight applications were filed pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court 2012 ("the Rules")</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The applications by the 1st and 2nd respondents were supported by the Affidavit of Dato' Seri Mohd Najib Tun Abdul Razak, the 3rd respondent by the Affidavit of Ahmad Johari bin Abdul Razak, the 4th respondent by the Affidavit of Dato' Mohd Nazim bin Tun Abdul Razak, the 5th and 6th respondents by the Affidavit of Tan Sri Cecil Wilbert Mohanaraj Abraham, the 7th respondent by the Affidavit of Zainal Abidin bin Muhayat, the 8th respondent by the Affidavit of Deepak Jaikishen a/l Jaikishan and the 9th respondent by the Affidavit of Arulampalam a/l Mariampillai.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> After hearing arguments on 20 November 2014, the learned judge reserved judgment to 11 December 2014, on which date she allowed the respondents' applications and struck out the writ and amended statement of claim. In the penultimate paragraph of her grounds of judgment, the learned judge made the following pronouncements:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> From the pronouncements, it is patently clear that she made eight similar but separate decisions, namely for encl 17 (1st and 2nd respondents), encl 19 (4th respondent), encl 21 (3rd respondent), encl 23 (5th and 6th respondents), encl 25 (7th respondent), encls 29 &amp; 30 (9th respondent) and encl 33 (8th respondent). Two different orders were made on costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Dissatisfied with the decisions, the appellants filed an appeal to this court vide Notice of Appeal dated 8 January 2015. This was the sole and only notice of appeal filed by the appellants and is couched in the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appeal came up for hearing before us on 10 April 2015. Except for the 8th respondent (Deepak Jaikishan), the rest of the respondents by seven separate Notices of Motion applied to have the appeal struck out on the ground that the notice of appeal was bad in law. It was argued that since seven orders were drawn up and seven sealed orders issued by the High Court, seven notices of appeal should have been filed by the appellants instead of only one.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellants took a different position. Their stand was that even though the hearing before the High Court involved separate applications by different respondents, the hearing of the matter took place simultaneously and the judgment of the High Court was embodied in one single written ground of decision. Figuratively speaking, the appellants' answer to the respondents' argument was that the seven seas may be seven continents apart but all seven converge towards land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It was submitted that since the grounds of judgment covered all arguments put forth by all parties, which were all premised on the same grounds that were ventilated before the learned judge, a single notice of appeal encompassing all the orders made was perfectly in order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Having heard the competing arguments, we unanimously allowed the respondents' applications and struck out the appellants' appeal pursuant to the powers conferred upon us by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;103.;;">rr 103</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;104.;;">104 of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994 ("the RCOA")</LINK>. These are our grounds.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Our attention was drawn to subrule (3) which provides that the notice of appeal shall substantially be in Form 1 in the First Schedule. For ease of reference, we reproduce below Form 1 of the First Schedule:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is, therefore, a statutory requirement that the notice of appeal must be in the prescribed Form 1. We agree with learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents that the RCOA envisages two situations: one where a dissatisfied party appeals against one decision and second, where a dissatisfied party appeals against more than one decision. To that, we must add that it includes also a situation where the dissatisfied party appeals against part only of the decision or decisions given.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In our view, where the appeal is against one decision involving a single respondent or involving more than one respondent in a joint action, it will be in order for the appellant to state in a single notice of appeal that he is appealing against "the whole of the said decision" without setting out the details of the decision appealed against. But where the appeal is against more than one decision arising from separate interlocutory applications made by different parties to the action, it is incumbent on the appellant to set out the details of the decisions in the notice of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In the present case, since more than one decision was given by the High Court in favour of nine different applicants arising from eight separate and distinct applications, it was imperative for the appellants to set out the details of each and every one of the decisions that they were appealing against. We do not think it was sufficient for the appellants to state in general terms in a single notice of appeal that their appeal was against "the whole of the said decision" (in the singular) without specifying the particulars of the decisions appealed against.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Likewise, a general reference to "the Order-in-Terms of all the defendants' applications to strike out" is not in our view sufficient compliance with the statutory requirement to set out the details. It was wrong and misleading for the appellants to refer to the eight decisions as being a "decision" against "all" the defendants when this was not a joint application by the nine applicants. In one respect at least, the decisions were not similar in that the learned judge made two different orders on costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Given the fact that there were eight separate applications before the court, the learned judge was procedurally bound to give eight separate decisions and not just one. Indeed eight decisions were given by the learned judge in the instant case. The reason why only eight decisions were given although there were nine applicants involved was because the 9th respondent filed two applications which were heard together, namely encl 29 and encl 30. Only seven orders were drawn up and only seven sealed orders were issued by the court because only seven sets of solicitors were involved.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> At the risk of repeating ourselves, we must stress the point that although the eight striking out applications were heard together before a single judge and judgment delivered on a single date, the fact is, separate decisions were given for each of the eight applications. It is inconceivable that the eight decisions made by the learned judge were embodied in one single decision. That is not borne out by the record, nor is it a logical proposition. The fact that only one ground of decision was delivered does not alter the fact that eight separate decisions were given.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> It is an undisputed fact that the eight applications were premised on different facts, different issues and different arguments by different lawyers. In addition to that, there were seven different affidavits filed by seven different sets of solicitors. Each of the eight applications was also the subject of different consideration by the learned judge as can be seen from the grounds of judgment. It is abundantly clear she dealt with each application separately. [20] It must further be noted that although all eight applications were made pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules</LINK>, not all were based on the same paragraphs of the subrule. The 1st and 2nd respondents' applications were grounded on paras (a), (b) and/or (d), the 3rd respondent on paras (a) or (b) and/or (d), the 4th respondent on paras (a), (b), (c) and/or (d), the 5th and 6th respondents on paras (a), (b), (c) and/or (d), the 7th and 8th respondents on paras (a), (b), (c) and/or (d) and 9th respondent on paras (a), (b) and/or (d).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The eight applications were also filed on different dates and given different registration numbers by the High Court and since no formal order for consolidation was made, it was a mere procedural convenience that the eight applications were heard together. Against this backdrop, the single notice of appeal filed by the appellants against "the whole of the said decision" and against "all the defendants' applications" begs the question: Which of the eight decisions were the appellants appealing against?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The appellants' argument would be tenable if their appeal was against the decision of the High Court in respect of the main suit. In that situation a single notice of appeal would be proper as the nine respondents were joint defendants and the reliefs prayed for against each of them were pleaded in a single statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Further, the court's decision would be to confined to the main suit and to no others. In short, it would be against that one decision that the appellants' appeal would be directed at, unlike the present case where the appeal was directed at eight different decisions in respect of eight different applications by nine different applicants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In opposing the applications, learned counsel for the appellants relied on the following authorities: <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_657;"><i>Woodsville Sdn Bhd v. Tien Ik Enterprises Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors And Other Appeals</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 657</LINK>; [2005] 2 CLJ 853, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_2_132;"><i>Abdul Jalal Ahmad &amp; Ors v. Pegawai Pemegang Harta Cawangan Negeri Sembilan &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 2 MLRH 132</LINK>; [2005] 1 MLJ 736; [2004] 7 CLJ 293, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRAU_2013_448;"><i>Berjaya Development Sdn Bhd v. Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad</i> [2013] MLRAU 448</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 606, <i>Hawes v. Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary</i>, The Times Law Reports May 20, 1993 (unreported), <i>Dixon v. Allgood</i> (Court of Appeal) (Civil Division) 14 April 1999 (unreported), <i>Rasheed v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>, <i>Mughal v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> and <i>Bashir v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; and Other Applications</i> [2014] EWCA Civ 1493.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We have studied those judgments carefully and except for the decision of this court in <i>Berjaya Development Sdn Bhd</i> which we shall deal with shortly, we do not find any them to be of real assistance in determining the issue before us, firstly, because the facts are materially different and, secondly, the passages highlighted by learned counsel are mostly remarks made in passing (<i>obiter dicta</i>) and do not form part of the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the cases.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As a matter of fact, the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Hawes v. Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary (supra)</i> runs contrary to the appellants' own position. In that case it was held, inter alia, that in the case of one hearing of more than one action, it was still necessary to file a notice of appeal in respect of each action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As for the case of <i>Berjaya Development Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, although the facts are not on all four with the facts of the present case, we find the judgment to be closest to the point under consideration. One of the issues raised in that case was whether it was possible for one notice of appeal to be filed for the three decisions that were given on two different dates by the High Court. It was held that this was possible provided the applications were heard together and the decision on the applications was given on a single date and the notice of appeal clearly described the applications involved and the respective decisions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> At first blush, this part of the judgment appears to be favourable to the appellants. But the court went on to hold that the filing of one notice of appeal in respect of all three decisions by the appellant was improper for being ambiguous and uncertain and that the proper way would have been to file three notices of appeal, one in respect of each decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The notice of appeal was held to be uncertain because it did not state which of the three decisions was decided on 18 September 2012 and which was decided on 10 October 2012. For context, we reproduce below the material part of the impugned notice of appeal:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> By way of comparison, the notice of appeal in the case before us, which was expressed to be against the whole of the "decision" and against "all" the respondents, gives the impression that the appeal was against one decision only and involving all the respondents. It does not convey with sufficient clarity which particular decision favouring which particular respondent was the appellants appealing against. This makes the notice bad for ambiguity and uncertainty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In our considered opinion, the defect in the notice of appeal is fatal and cannot be cured by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;1A.;;">O 1A of the Rules</LINK>. What the appellants should have done was either to file seven separate notices of appeal or alternatively to file one notice of appeal but setting out the details of each decision appealed against. Neither was done by the appellants. On our part we take the view that the second option is the more practical option as it will avoid the filing of multiple Records of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Given the factual matrix of the case, we do not think that the objections raised by the respondents to the notice of appeal can be trivialised as being mere procedural or technical acrobatics. It goes to the jurisdiction of the court. The objections raised are premised on a statutory requirement, a condition precedent to this court entertaining the appeal and not a mere irregularity that can be waived.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It was for all these reasons that we allowed the applicants' applications and struck out the appeal with costs. As for the 8th respondent who did not apply for striking out of the appeal, we have fixed another date to hear the appellants' appeal involving him.</p>
