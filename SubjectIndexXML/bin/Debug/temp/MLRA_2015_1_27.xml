    <p>The respondents, who were natives of Sarawak, filed two separate writs of summons against the appellants, claiming that their native customary rights ('NCR') over a piece of land had been infringed with the issuance of three provisional leases or forests timber licences ('leases') by the appellants to companies over the land. The respondents alleged that the act of granting the leases was not made known to them and that they were not provided with compensation in accordance with the law. The respondents therefore pleaded that the alienation under those leases was null and void. The appellants filed two separate applications to strike out the respondents' actions under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ('RHC')</LINK>, which were heard together by the High Court. The appellants argued that the principal remedies sought by the respondents in their writs of summons sought to nullify the leases or sought to entitle them to exercise their alleged NCR over the NCR claimed land. The respondents' actions therefore were improper and an abuse of the court's process as their actions were tantamount to challenging the decision of a public authority. As such, the respondents ought to have proceeded by way of judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the RHC ('O 53')</LINK>. The High Court dismissed the appellants' applications and their appeals to the Court of Appeal were also dismissed. The appellants now appealed before the Federal Court on the following question for determination: whether a suit filed by a person(s) claiming NCR to challenge the decision of a public authority which supposedly infringed the claimant's alleged rights was an exception to the general rule enunciated by the Federal Court in <i>Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri v. Pengarah Kebudayaan &amp; Kesenian Johor &amp; Ors</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeals:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondents pleaded that they obtained the NCR way back in the time of World War 2, whilst some even claimed it was as early as 1910. Their lives were disrupted when on a date unknown to them and without their knowledge and consent, companies obtained leases and licences from the appellants over their NCR land. Neither had the appellants extinguished the respondents' NCR nor compensated them under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;;">Land Code (Sarawak) (Cap 81) ('Code')</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution ('FC')</LINK>. The appellants in their defence denied all the material particulars of the acquisition in relation to the NCR and demanded that the respondents be put to strict proof of the acquisitions. As such, a serious dispute of facts existed. (paras 21-23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondents' claim to NCR connected to the NCR land alienated under the leases by the appellants begged the question of a right over property. Without touching on the acts of the authorities (and importing ingredients of public law), at first blush the impression given was that the matter came within the ambit of private law proceedings. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The respondents contended that their NCR had been adversely affected, infringed or impaired by the issuance of the leases. They challenged and questioned the legality and proper exercise of the statutory powers to issue the same. They were not seeking to nullify the public law on native rights but were trying to establish the facts upon which their NCR claims were based. Obviously, the present appeals related essentially to questions of fact relating to private law of the respondents, though enmeshed with public law. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In light of their want of sophistication let alone the fact that the respondents lived deep in the hinterland, to expect the respondents to file judicial review applications within the legislated statutory time limit after the appellants' public acts and adhere to protocol finesse as fashioned out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> might lead to real injustice to them. Such strict expectation from the natives would result in "irreparable injustice" to them (<i>Nikodemus Singai &amp; Ors v. Sibu Slipway Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i>). The mode of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> was clearly unsuitable for cases of this genus. The NCR's value could not stand on its own but intertwined with the NCR land. It was from this NCR land, which comprised farmland and forests, that the respondents derived food, valuable medicines, wildlife and other forest produce for their livelihood and sustenance. They would farm, cultivate and plant paddy, fruit trees, rubber trees, cocoa and other essential trees and crops on it. The NCR land was fundamental to their social, cultural and spiritual survival as natives of Sarawak. The NCR land was not only a source of livelihood but constituted life itself. As such, to allow with a stroke of a pen a singular government servant to oust and uproot a whole community, and without any real chance of voicing their grievances when extinguishing their NCR, was surely not what Parliament intended. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The right to compensation when dispossessed of property was a constitutional right, borne out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13(1) of the FC</LINK> and the language used was imperative and demanded obedience. Specifically for Sarawak, alluding to the words used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">s 5(3)(a) of the Code</LINK>, compensation was mandatory when an extinguishment of any NCR took place (as opposed to extinguishment of title over land). With the respondents having pleaded that their NCR and constitutional rights had been violated, procedural efficacy must give way to the supreme law of Malaysia. With so much at stake, and in light of the prevailing dispute of facts, the respondents had to mount a successful claim of their NCR by way of the writs of summons. (para 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Having considered the bigger picture, in light of constitutional, statutory and common law recognition of NCR, compounded by the injustice that might befall the respondents, on account of their disadvantaged predicament, the respondents' writ actions qualified as an exception to the norm. Apart from not finding any legal basis of the respondents having abused the process of court in filing the two writs of summons, the question posed for determination should be answered in the positive.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Suriyadi Halim Omar FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 27 June 2012 the Federal Court granted leave to the appellants for appeals number 01(f)-14-07-2012(Q) (the 1st appeal) and 01(f)-15-07-2012(Q) (the 2nd appeal), cumulatively referred to as the appeals. The appeals were against the decisions of the Court of Appeal, delivered on 15 February 2012, dismissing the appellants' appeals against the decision of the High Court at Kuching.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The leave granted was to determine the following question of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Facts Of The Cases</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In two separate writs of summons actions filed against the appellants, the respondents who are Bidayuh by race and also natives of Sarawak, prayed for various declaratory reliefs. The respondents pleaded that they previously acquired native customary rights (NCR) over tracts of land, hereinafter referred to as native customary rights land (NCR land), which had been infringed. The respondents claimed that the NCR was acquired pursuant to adat or customs of the Bidayuh of Sarawak, with their ancestors and themselves, being entitled to the NCR land. They also pleaded that the principle of Common Law aided them in acquiring the NCR. Those rights are recognised by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;;">Sarawak Land Code (Cap 81)</LINK>, created and acquired prior to 1 January 1958, and still subsisting as such. It was the respondents' case that their NCR was extinguished by the 2nd appellant, acting through the 1st appellant, when alienating their NCR land through three Provisional Leases or Forests Timber Licences (interchangeably referred to as the leases) to companies over the NCR land. Not only were the act of granting the leases not made known to them but no compensation in accordance with law was provided for. The respondents therefore pleaded that the alienation under those leases was null and void.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We now provide more details. The respondents pleaded that the granting of the leases by the 1st and 2nd appellants were public acts or decisions in the exercise of statutory powers, conferred by the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;;">Land Code of Sarawak (Cap 81)</LINK> and the Sarawak Forests Ordinance respectively. The acts of the appellants were invalid and unlawful, with the acts anchored heavily on abuse of power, breach of the rules of natural justice, unconstitutionality, illegality and breach of fundamental liberties as enshrined in Part II of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>. The respondents pleaded that the extinguishment of the NCR violated their rights under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The filing of the two writs of summons (the writs) by the respondents met with the appellants' disapproval who forthwith filed two separate applications to strike them out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;14A.;;">O 14A of the Rules of High Court 1980 ("RHC")</LINK>. The applications were heard together.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The appellants argued that the principal remedies sought by the respondents in the writs were declarations to nullify the leases or to entitle them to exercise their alleged NCR over the alleged acquired NCR land. The format of the respondents' action therefore was improper and an abuse of the process of the court as their actions tantamount to challenging the decision of a public authority. That being so, the respondents ought to have proceeded by way of judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (O 53)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 21 October 2009 the appellants' applications were dismissed with costs by the High Court. Being aggrieved, the appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal but also lost there on 15 February 2012. We now deal with the leave question as granted by the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Not unlike the course of action taken by the High Court and the Court of Appeal, despite the respondents' actions being filed at different times, what with the lands and parties involved being different, we likewise heard the appeals together. The common thread that ran in the appeals enabled us to undertake this course of action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Appellants' Position</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellants took the position that from the claims and prayers set out by the respondents in the writs the challenge was against the validity of the act causing the creation of the leases. As the 1st appellant was a public authority the act was of a public one, hence falling under the domain of public law. No private law element was involved be it in regard to the challenge of the leases or the respondents' alleged NCR over the alleged NCR land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In the course of his argument, amongst others, the appellants' counsel referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_1_483;"><i>Shaharuddin Ali &amp; Anor v. Superintendent Of Lands And Surveys Kuching Division &amp; Anor</i> [2004] 1 MLRH 483</LINK>; [2005] 2 MLJ 555; [2004] 4 CLJ 775 where at p 491 the following remarks were referred to:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Learned counsel for the appellants also proceeded to discuss the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_573;"><i>Jalang Paran &amp; Anor v. Government Of The State Of Sarawak &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 573</LINK>; [2011] 3 MLJ 13; [2011] 3 CLJ 469. He referred to pp 579-580 (<i>Jalang</i>'s case), where the court opined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Other cases were submitted by the appellants and they had also alluded to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_524;"><i>Ahmad Jefri Mohd Jahri v. Pengarah Kebudayaan &amp; Kesenian Johor &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 524</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 145; [2010] 5 CLJ 865. It declared that matters that have substantive public law elements must be proceeded with through the mechanism of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 RHC</LINK> or otherwise that provision would be rendered redundant. Reference was made to James Foong FCJ's remarks, which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On the issue of exceptions, the appellants submitted that a suit filed by a person claiming NCR to challenge the decision of a public authority, which supposedly infringed a claimant's alleged rights was not an exception to the general rule. Counsel for the appellants referred to the remarks in <i>Ahmad Jefri</i>, which read:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Learned counsel further padded his argument by ventilating that by undue delay and failing to commence the actions in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> the respondents had been guilty of abuse of legal process.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Learned counsel for the appellant finally wound up his submission by canvassing that in the appeals before us there was substantial public element involved, and what with <i>Ahmad Jefri</i> now having been followed by the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_629;"><i>Ketua Pengarah Buruh v. Britania Brands (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 629</LINK>; [2010] 6 CLJ 370, the proper action was by way of judicial review rather than by writ action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondents' Position</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In reply, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the issue of rights under NCR falls under the exception to the <i>O'Reilly</i>'s principle as it tilts more towards the realm of private law rather than of public law.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The respondents strongly urged this court to answer the question posed in the positive in that they were right in filing the writs rather than proceeding by way of judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Decision Of The Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The issue for our determination is actually restricted to the issue of whether it was appropriate for the respondents to commence their actions by filing the writs. Principally, the respondents pleaded that they obtained the NCR way back to the time of World War 2, whilst some even claimed as early as 1910. Their lives were disrupted when on a date unknown to them and without their knowledge and consent, companies obtained leases and licences (from 2004-2008 by perusal of the pleadings) from the appellants over their NCR land. Neither had the appellants extinguished the respondents' NCR nor compensated them under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;;">Land Code of Sarawak</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In their defence, the appellants denied all the material particulars of the acquisition in relation to the NCR and demanded that the respondents be put to strict proof of the acquisitions. In a gist, serious dispute of facts existed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Despite agreeing in their defence that there was serious disagreement as to the facts, yet striking out applications were filed by the appellants. The appellants grounded the applications on the premise that the determination of questions of law would finally dispose of the respondents' claims. As said earlier, the striking out applications were dismissed not only at the High Court but also at the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In the course of the submission before us the picture became clearer when learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the claims and prayers of the respondents which led to the appeals fell under the domain of public law. He in no uncertain terms said that no private law element existed, "in regard to the challenge to the issuance of the said Provisional Leases or the said Forest Timber licences or the alleged non-recognition and non-extinguishment of the respondents' alleged NCR over part of land within the said land".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> To resolve the leave question for our determination it is essential to draw a distinction between private law proceedings and public law proceedings. Generally speaking when a decision is arrived at by a public body in performance of a public duty resulting in any infringement that affects substantive principles of public law, and which may affect members of the public, the proceedings that ensues is treated as public law proceedings. An aggrieved party may allude to judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 at the High Court</LINK> for any reparation of injustice and may include a prayer for a declaration as in the current appeals (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order53;SN2.;;">O 53 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The power of the High Court in a judicial review is enshrined under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;;">Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK> and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (CJA)</LINK>, in particular the additional powers that are set out at para 1 of the Schedule to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;25.;;">s 25(2) of the CJA</LINK>. It empowers the High Court to issue to any person of authority directions, orders or writs, including writs of the nature of <i>habeas corpus</i>, <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition, <i>quo warranto</i> and <i>certiorari</i>, or any orders, for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part II of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In the traditional sense judicial review refers to the exercise of the court's supervisory powers over the decisions of inferior tribunals and statutory bodies, but does not function as an appellate body (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_1997_1_28;"><i>Michael Lee Fook Wah v. Menteri Sumber Tenaga Manusia, Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [1997] 1 MELR 28</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 305; [1998] 1 CLJ 227; [1997] 4 AMR 4258, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MELR_2006_1_14;"><i>Menara Panglobal Sdn Bhd v. Arokianathan Sivapiragasam</i> [2006] 1 MELR 14</LINK>; [2006] 3 MLJ 493; [2006] 2 CLJ 501; [2006] 3 AMR 555 at p 29).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> As opposed to public law proceedings, in private law proceedings only the parties who are directly concerned with the outcome of the litigation, are affected. The public at large are not usually interested in the outcome, except to see that the private law proceedings had been carried out in a fair and efficient manner when resolving disputes between individuals, and of enforcing the rights of one individual over another.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The instant appeals concern the respondents' claim to NCR connected to the NCR land alienated under the leases by the appellants, which begs the question of a right over property. Without touching on the acts of the authorities (and importing ingredients of public law), at first blush the impression given is that the matter comes within the ambit of private law proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> A claim made by claimants for native rights is not a novel subject, as many a case of this nature has come before us for adjudication, be it from Sabah and Sarawak or even West Malaysia. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1997_3_95;"><i>Adong Kuwau &amp; Ors v. Kerajaan Negeri Johor &amp; Anor</i> [1997] 3 MLRH 95</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 418; [1997] 3 CLJ 885 the court recognised the rights of the aboriginal people, which include '... the right to move freely about their land, without any form of disturbance or interference and also to live from the produce of the land itself but not to the land itself in the modern sense that the aborigines can convey, lease out, rent out the land itself or any produce therein since they have been in continuous and unbroken occupation and/or enjoyment of the rights of the land from time immemorial ... In Malaysia the aborigines' common law rights include, <i>inter alia</i>, the right to live on their land as their forefathers had lived and this would mean that even the future generations of the aboriginal people would be entitled to this right of their forefathers.' That view was affirmed by <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_170;"><i>Kerajaan Negeri Johor &amp; Anor v. Adong Kuwau &amp; Ors</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 170</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 158; [1998] 2 CLJ 665; [1998] 2 AMR 1233 when it held that common law recognises native customary rights. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2002_1_161;"><i>Sagong Tasi &amp; Ors v. Kerajaan Negeri Selangor &amp; Ors</i> [2002] 1 MLRH 161</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 591; [2002] 2 CLJ 543; [2002] 2 AMR 2028 the trial judge appeared to have given some indication as to the limit of such claim i.e. limited only to the area that forms their settlement, and not to the jungle at large where they used to roam to forage for their livelihood in accordance with their tradition. What is the area of the settlement and its size would be a question of fact. The Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_3_481;"><i>Racha Urud &amp; Ors v. Ravenscourt Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 3 MLRA 481</LINK>; [2014] 3 MLJ 661; [2014] 4 CLJ 393 recognised the prevailing predicament of disputes when an NCR is claimed as against the stance of the authorities which refused to recognise the claimant's right.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> As indicated earlier, the matter before us is more procedural in nature, ie the use of appropriate procedure in enforcing the NCR. The contention of the respondents was that their rights to it had been adversely affected, infringed or impaired by the issuance of the Provisional Leases and the Forests Timber Licences. They challenged and questioned the legality and proper exercise of those statutory powers to issue the same. Needless to say, NCR claims are disputes between private individuals claiming a private law right on one hand and with the public authority refusing to recognise their NCR at the other end. But by no figment of the imagination were the respondents seeking to nullify the public law on native rights but rather about them establishing the facts upon which their NCR claims were based. Obviously the appeals before us related essentially to questions of fact relating to private law of the respondents though enmeshed with public law. James Foong FCJ in <i>Ahmad Jefri</i> did suggest that in a situation 'if it is a mixture of public and private law then the court must ascertain which of the two is more predominant'. Unfortunately the matter before us was not all that cut and dry. To surgically consider which law outweighs the other, may not only deprive the respondents of their day in court but also ignore the reality, <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the respondents pleaded that they had been dispossessed and unless permitted to adduce oral evidence they would be disadvantaged when attempting to establish their NCR claims;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>oral evidence could surely help to clarify the customs and tradition which are peculiar to the Bidayuh;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the respondents pleaded that they had been deprived of the NCR and yet had been compensated. If oral evidence were adduced the issue of compensation, be it eligibility or amount, could be resolved;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the respondents was handicapped by illiteracy, poverty and insurmountable logistical problems as they live in the hinterland;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even if they were aware of the extinguishment of the NCR/ alienation of the NCR land to third parties (companies), their lack of sophistication would not enable them to respond promptly to the rigours of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK>. This brings to the forefront the factor of time and distance. If prompt compliance with the time requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> is meaningless to the respondents even if forewarned, any ignorance of time of alienation of their NCR over the leased land can only exacerbate matter; and</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Much earlier on we did state that as the issue of proprietary rights over NCR was central to the current discussion we hinted that the matter could easily fall within the ambit of private law proceeding. On the other hand the matter could also fall within the realm of public law as it could not be disputed that the appellants were the parties that issued the provisional leases and the forest licences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In the House of Lords case of <i>Reilly v. Mackman</i> [1982] 3 All ER 1124 it was held that as a general rule, it is contrary to public policy and thus an abuse of process for a person who sought to establish that a decision or action of a person or body that had infringed rights to proceed by way of an ordinary claim (rather than the judicial review procedure). Despite the above holding Lord Diplock supplied a window of opening when he said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Taking advantage of the crack an increasing number of NCR cases have tilted in favour of them falling under private law, with the latest being <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_1_1;"><i>Bato Bagi &amp; Ors v. Kerajaan Negeri Sarawak &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2012] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 297; [2011] 8 CLJ 766; [2011] 5 AMR 493. Richard Malanjum, Chief Judge, Sabah and Sarawak had occasion to state that in cases involving native customary rights <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> was not a suitable mode of proceeding, especially when the natives sought to enforce a constitutional right by way of a declaration to that effect. The learned Chief Judge gave further guidance on this matter when he likewise said that cases concerning native customary rights should be regarded as an exception to the rule in <i>O'Reilly (supra)</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> As illustrated above, in light of their want of sophistication let alone the respondents live deep in the hinterland, to expect the respondents to file judicial review applications within the legislated statutory time limit after the appellants' public acts and adhere to protocol finesse as fashioned out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> may lead to real injustice to them. Such strict expectation from the natives would result in "irreparable injustice" to them (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_14_269;"><i>Nikodemus Singai &amp; Ors v. Sibu Slipway Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 14 MLRH 269</LINK>; [2010] 10 CLJ 383). Clearly the mode of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53</LINK> is unsuitable for cases of this genus. It must be borne in mind that the NCR's value cannot stand on its own but intertwined with the NCR land. It is from this NCR land, which comprise farmland and forest that the respondents will derive food, valuable medicines, wildlife and other forest produce for their livelihood and sustenance. They will farm, cultivate and plant paddy, fruit trees, rubber trees, cocoa and other essential trees and crops on it. The NCR land is fundamental to their social, cultural and spiritual survival as natives of Sarawak. In other words the NCR land not only is a source of livelihood but constitute life itself. To allow with a stroke of a pen a singular government servant to oust and uproot a whole community, and without any real chance of voicing their grievances when extinguishing their NCR, was surely not what Parliament had in mind.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The right to compensation when dispossessed of property is a constitutional right, borne out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> and the language used is imperative and demands obedience. Specifically for Sarawak, alluding to the words used in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1958_81;5.;;">s 5(3)(a) of the Sarawak Land Code</LINK>, compensation is mandatory when an extinguishment of any NCR takes place (as opposed to extinguishment of title over land). With the respondents having pleaded that their native customary rights and constitutional rights having been violated, procedural efficacy must surely give way to the supreme law of Malaysia. With so much at stake, and in light of the prevailing dispute of facts, how then are the respondents to mount a successful claim of the NCR if not by writs of summons?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Having considered the bigger picture, in light of constitutional, statutory and common law recognition of NCR, compounded by the injustice that may befall the respondents, on account of their disadvantaged predicament, we find that the respondents' writ actions qualify as an exception to the norm.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Apart from not finding any legal basis of the respondents having abused the process of court in filing the two writs we answer the question for our determination in the positive. We therefore unanimously dismiss the appeals with costs.</p>
