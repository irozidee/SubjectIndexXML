    <p>The appellant bank had granted a loan to the respondents to finance the purchase of a shoplot ('the property') at RM601,900 from a developer company called Transbay Ventures Sdn Bhd ('developer'). The respondents and the developer had earlier executed a sale and purchase agreement ('SPA') in respect of the subject property on 8 September 1996 which was under construction in an area known as the JB Waterfront City, an area wholly owned by the developer. The appellant and the respondents had executed a loan agreement cum deed of assignment ('LACA') whereupon the property and the full and entire benefit of the SPA together with all rights, title and interest of the respondents were assigned to the appellant free from any encumbrances as security. The appellant had also disbursed the loan progressively in accordance with the architect's certificates following the schedule of payment in the SPA. It transpired that the developer had charged the master title to the JB Waterfront City to Public Bank Berhad ('PBB') as security for a loan taken with PBB and that the developer had defaulted in servicing the loan, the result of which led PBB to institute foreclosure proceedings against the developer whereupon an order for sale was obtained on 7 October 2003 which included the subject property. Sometime in 2004, the appellant who had come to know of the foreclosure proceedings sought to intervene in the said proceedings to obtain an order to exclude the property from any order for sale that PBB might obtain in respect of the charge. The learned judge had heard the application on 14 August 2008 but made no ruling on the said matter. Instead he directed the liquidators of the developer to obtain approval from the regulatory authorities for the sale of the JB Waterfront City to new purchasers and that the proceeds of sale be used to pay off the amount owing to PBB under the charge and to secure the release of the respondents' property. In the interim period, the respondents had defaulted on their loan resulting in the appellant filing an action in the High Court to recover the balance owing under the loan. The respondents, on the other hand, filed a counterclaim to recover the sum of RM151,900 which they had paid directly to the developer and the sum of RM326,738 which the respondents had repaid the appellant under the loan. The learned judge, after finding that the LACA was rendered void because of the order of sale obtained by PBB, had dismissed the appellant's claim and had allowed the respondents' counterclaim. The appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> By virtue of cl 5.34 SPA, the respondents had expressly given their consent to the developer to create a charge on the master title to the JB Waterfront City. The respondents could not claim that the SPA had been frustrated. The contract did not become impossible to perform due to any supervening event. The contract became impossible to perform because the developer failed to release the property from the charge on the master title, which was occasioned by the respondents' own act of giving consent to the developer to create a charge on the master title. (paras 27-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> A purchaser ran the risk that his right over his parcel of land might be subject to a registered charge on the master title to the whole land. In the event the developer defaulted and failed to pay the chargee, the entire land would be sold in a foreclosure proceeding (<i>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd v. John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd, John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd v. Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd</i>). The fact that the respondents expressly consented to the developer charging the master title to PBB meant that the respondents were willing to shoulder the risk of foreclosure in the event the developer defaulted in paying the loan and the potential loss from the foreclosure. That result was within the reasonable contemplation of the respondents in consenting to the creation of the charge pursuant to cl 5.34 SPA. (paras 51-52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The risk did not pass to the appellant under the LACA. The LACA was a loan transaction. The root of the loan transaction was not the property itself because the property merely served as a security for the repayment of the loan. The LACA stood independently from the SPA. The performance of the obligations under the LACA did not become impossible even if the SPA was frustrated. (para 53)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> It was only the benefit of the SPA that was assigned to the banker as security for the repayment of the loan. The obligations and risks under the SPA remained with the purchaser (respondents) as was expressly provided for in cl 7 LACA. The Federal Court case of <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i> stipulated that there was no out-and-out purchase in an assignment of that nature and that the usual rule in law that the risk of the property passed upon execution of the SPA did not apply to the LACA. (paras 55-56)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Even if the property was lost or destroyed, that fact did not and could not frustrate the LACA. The learned judge erred in law when she held that the LACA was frustrated because of the foreclosure proceedings on the master title. She failed to consider the settled legal position pertaining to the nature and effect of the LACA transactions together with the rights, liabilities and risks of the various parties in transactions of that nature. (para 57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The developer was obliged to deliver the title to the purchaser under the SPA and that responsibility could not be passed to the banker. Whilst it was acknowledged that it was not fair to borrowers who have paid the loan and interest to the bank to end up losing the property, it would be equally unfair to the bank to hold it responsible as well. The decision of <i>Arab Malaysian Bank Bhd v. Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> was wrongly decided and inconsistent with the judgment of the Federal Court in <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i>. The High Court in <i>Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd</i> erred in holding that the main purpose of the loan agreement was to finance the purchase of the units by the defendants and that the consideration for the agreement was the assigned units. It was obvious that a banker gave a loan in consideration of its repayment with interest and the purpose for which the borrower took the loan was not the consideration for the loan transaction. (paras 63-66)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> At the time the assignment was created, the property did not exist. What existed was the SPA between the developer and the respondents. The learned judge erred in holding that the appellant could no longer satisfy the requirements of cl 37 LACA in order to release the security. The appellant was always capable of reassigning the chose in action that had been assigned to it, back to the respondents. The learned judge erred when she equated the chose in action with physical property. In reality, it was the rights under the SPA with the developer that were assigned. (paras 69-73)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The appellant could not be held liable in law if the property was lost. That the property was lost because the order for sale obtained by PBB still subsisted was inconsistent with the court's direction dated 14 August 2008. That court order was for the liquidators to obtain approval from the regulatory authorities for the sale of the entire development to new purchasers and that the proceeds of sale to be used to pay off the amount owing to PBB under the charge and to secure the release of the respondents' property. If those conditions were not met, then the application to intervene and set aside the order for sale would be reinstated and fixed for hearing. The High Court did not make any decision on the application to intervene and to set aside the order for sale. Although the order for sale might still be subsisting, it was apparent that the court's directions therein showed that the order was kept in abeyance pending the disposal of the development by the liquidator to a third party. With that background scenario, it was premature to conclude that the property was lost. (paras 74-77)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The High Court in <i>Malayan Banking Bhd v. Tonyin Fast Food Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> rightly emphasised that the question of priorities between the assignment and the registered charge was a matter to be determined by the court. Until the court made a decision that the charge took priority over the assignment, there was no basis to conclude that the property was lost. The learned judge erred when she held otherwise. (para 78)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">Section 15 Civil Law Act 1956 ('CLA')</LINK> was overlooked by the learned judge. She committed a serious error of law when she applied <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;66.;;">s 66 Contracts Act 1950 ('CA')</LINK> in isolation without reading it together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 CLA</LINK>. While <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;66.;;">s 66 CA</LINK> spelt out the general consequences when a contract was said to be void, the consequences of frustration of a contract as set out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 CLA</LINK> could not be ignored. When a contract was frustrated under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15(1) CLA</LINK>, subsections (2) to (6) came into play. While the learned judge found that the LACA had been frustrated, she did not find that the SPA was frustrated. (paras 80-82)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> The learned judge erred in making the first order ordering the appellant to refund the sum of RM151,900 being part of the purchase price paid by the respondents to the developer. The SPA was a separate contract and the respondents paid the sum of RM151,900 to the developer directly under that contract. She did not make any finding that the contract had been frustrated and even if she did, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15(2) CLA</LINK>, it was the developer and not the appellant that would be liable to refund the sum of RM151,900 to the respondents. Since that sum was not paid by the respondents to the appellant under the LACA, the respondents were not entitled under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15(2)</LINK> to recover that sum. (para 86)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> The second order made by the learned judge was that the appellant refund the sum of RM355,409 to the respondents being the instalments paid by the respondents to the appellant under the LACA. Under the LACA, the appellant had granted the term loan to the respondents to enable them to pay for the purchase of the property which they had bought from the developer. The LACA stipulated that the appellant must disburse the term loan to the developer. In fact, that was the expense the appellant incurred in the performance of the LACA prior to frustration. The total sum which the appellant disbursed to the developer was RM450,000 and that was the total expense which the appellant incurred in the performance of the LACA prior to frustration. The learned judge had clearly ignored the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 CLA</LINK> when she made the order. (paras 87-88)</p>

      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the High Court at Johor Bahru after a full trial. The learned High Court Judge dismissed the appellant's claim and allowed the respondents' counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This appeal concerned specific findings made by the learned High Court Judge. This court will not readily intervene with the findings of fact arrived at by the trial court unless there is a fundamental misdirection that warrants appellate intervention. The law reports are replete with authorities setting out instances where appellate intervention was exercised.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We applied these authorities in considering the current appeal at hand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Now, before us, learned counsel for the appellant argued that the learned High Court Judge was plainly wrong in arriving at her decision and that there was insufficient judicial appreciation of the evidence adduced during the trial. While learned counsel for the respondents submitted to the contrary and he argued that the learned High Court Judge was right and that the appellant's appeal should be dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts Of The Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Before we proceed any further, we will now narrate the facts based on the evidence tendered before the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> By way of a sale and purchase agreement dated 8 September 1996 (hereinafter referred to as "the SPA"), the respondents agreed to purchase from the vendor, Transbay Ventures Sdn Bhd (hereinafter referred to as "the developer"), a shoplot (hereinafter referred to as "the property") in an area dubbed as the JB Waterfront City. The purchase price was listed at RM601,900.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The respondents applied for a loan from the appellant. And by way of a letter of offer dated 26 December 1996 as seen at pp 116 to 122 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2, the appellant offered the respondents an overdraft of RM180,000.00 and a term loan of RM270,000.00 to part finance the purchase of the property. A supplementary letter of offer dated 10 January 2001 as seen at pp 123 to 124 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2 showed that the appellant agreed to the respondents' request to convert the overdraft facility into a term loan. The respondents paid directly to the developer the difference between the purchase price and the loan sum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The parties executed a loan agreement cum deed of assignment dated 3 February 1997 (hereinafter referred to as "the LACA") as seen at pp 125 to 161 of the appeal record at Jilid 2, whereupon the property and the full and entire benefit of the SPA together with all rights, title and interest of the respondents were assigned to the appellant, free from any encumbrances, as security. By letter dated 28 February 1997 (exh "P4") as seen at pp 162 to 163 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2, the appellant's solicitors confirmed that the LACA had been duly stamped and registered in the High Court. It was also stated in the same letter that the respondents had paid the difference between the balance of the purchase price and the loan sum to the developer. In the same letter, the appellant's solicitors also informed the appellant that the Johor Bahru land office had confirmed that the master title to the JB Waterfront City had yet to be issued and that a search on the title would be conducted upon issuance of the master title. Finally, in the same letter, the appellant's solicitors also advised that the loan would be released progressively to the developer in accordance with the architect's certificates. The appellant's witness, by the name of Ms Loo Sok Cheng, in her witness statement at p 67 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1, responded to the question that was posed to her in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> By letter dated 19 March 1997 (exh "P5") as seen at p 164 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2, the developer gave the appellant several undertakings in consideration of the disbursement of the loan and that would include the undertaking to deliver to the appellant the strata title for the property free from encumbrances upon its issuance together with a valid memorandum of transfer in favour of the respondents. The developer's undertakings to the appellant in exh "P5" were worded in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Since all the security documents pertaining to the property were in order, the appellant proceeded to disburse the loan progressively on the strength of the architect's certificates.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Unknown to both the appellant and the respondents, the master title to the JB Waterfront City was issued by the Johor Bahru land office bearing title number vide HS(D) 256676 PTB 20214 Bandar Johor Bahru, Negeri Johor. But the developer who knew about the issuance of the master title, charged the said master title to Public Bank Berhad by way of a charge Presentation No: 32284/98.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The developer defaulted in servicing the loan to Public Bank Berhad. The latter instituted foreclosure proceedings against the developer. On 7 October 2003, Public Bank Berhad, the chargee of the master title to the whole of Lot 1 Complex at the JB Waterfront City, pursuant to the charge dated 26 June 1998, obtained an order for sale in respect of all the units of Lot 1 Complex at the JB Waterfront City including the property in question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Justice Kang Hwee Gee (as he then was) sitting in the High Court at Johor Bahru gave the order for sale dated 7 October 2003 as seen at pp 270 to 277 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 3. The order for sale was worded, <i>inter alia</i>, in this way (see pp 271 to 272 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 3):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The appellant only knew about the foreclosure proceedings and the charge of the master title in favour of Public Bank Berhad from an advertisement in the newspaper. In this context, the witness statement of Ms Loo Sok Cheng at pp 66 to 67 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1 revealed the current state of affairs. For convenience, it will now be reproduced:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant sought to intervene in the foreclosure proceedings and to obtain an order to exclude the property from any order for sale that Public Bank Berhad may obtain in regard to the charge. In this context, reference must be made to the witness statement of Ms Loo Sok Cheng at p 67 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1 and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The appellant's application to intervene was heard by Justice Kang Hwee Gee (as he then was) at the High Court. But His Lordship did not make any ruling on the matter. The witness statement of Ms Loo Sok Cheng at pp 68 to 70 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1 alluded to the <i>status quo</i> of the appellant's application to intervene at some length and we will now reproduce them:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In the mean time, the respondents defaulted on the loan that was extended by the appellant. By letter dated 10 July 2007 as seen at pp 192 to 193 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2, the appellant issued a notice of demand (exh "P14") to both the respondents demanding for the arrears on the sum. The notice of demand in exh "P14" was worded in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> But the respondents failed to comply with the notice of demand. This prompted the appellant to issue a notice dated 17 September 2007 (exh "P15") to terminate and recall the loan. That notice in exh "P15" can be seen at pp 194 to 195 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2, and it was worded in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> By letter dated 25 September 2007 (exh "P12") as seen at p 190 the Appeal Record at Jilid 2, the respondents wrote to the appellant and sought to re-schedule payments due to financial difficulties. The appellant acceded to the respondents' request and issued a letter dated 7 November 2007 (exh "P13") as seen at p 191 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2 allowing the respondents to pay the monthly instalment at a lower rate. That letter in exh "P13" was worded in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> But the respondents failed to pay the instalments as re-scheduled. This prompted the appellant to file the action in the High Court at Johor Bahru to recover the balance owing under the loan inclusive of interest and costs. The respondents, on the other hand, filed a counterclaim to recover the sum of RM151,900.00 which they paid directly to the developer and the sum of RM326,738.00 which the respondents had repaid the appellant under the loan as well as damages, interest and costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Analysis</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> There were specific findings made by the learned High Court Judge that must be referred to. Her Ladyship held that the LACA had been rendered void because of the order for sale that was obtained by Public Bank Berhad. That would, according to Her Ladyship, make it impossible for the appellant to reassign the property. Her Ladyship also held that although the appellant had applied to intervene in the foreclosure proceedings filed by Public Bank Berhad at the Johor Bahru High Court, there was no court order that excluded the property in question from the order for sale. In her written grounds of judgment at p 35 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1, Her Ladyship had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In regard to the letters emanating from some solicitors assuring that the property had been excluded from the order for sale, the High Court Judge held that these letters were not enforceable in law because the LACA was an absolute assignment to the appellant and the respondents were powerless to act to protect their interest and rights over the property. Her Ladyship further held that the LACA was frustrated and void, bearing in mind that the appellant could not perform its obligation to re-assign the property upon full repayment of the loan taken by the respondents. In this context, this was what Her Ladyship said in her written grounds of judgment at p 36 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> After holding that the LACA had been frustrated, Her Ladyship then referred to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;66.;;">s 66 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> and finally concluded at p 37 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Before us, learned counsel for the appellant argued that the LACA was neither frustrated nor void. It was emphasised that the respondents had expressly given their consent to the developer to create a charge on the master title. Reference was made to cl 5.34 of the SPA which states as follows (see p 237 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 3):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> That being the case, when the SPA was signed on 8 September 1996, it was agreed between the developer and the respondents that the developer could charge the master title in favour of Public Bank Berhad. Consequently, even though the respondents were not notified by the developer about the creation of the charge to Public Bank Berhad, clause 5.34 of the SPA showed that the respondents had consented to the creation of the charge "or in any way encumber" the said property.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Now, we have the situation where the charge, in favour of Public Bank Berhad, was created with the consent of the respondents. In the context of cl 5.34 of the SPA, if the developer fails to exclude the property from the charge and transfer the property to the respondents "free from all registrable encumbrances", the developer would certainly breach cl 5.34. That breach entitles the respondents to institute an action against the developer for breach of contract. Read in its proper perspective, since Public Bank Berhad took foreclosure proceedings against the developer on the master title which resulted in the loss of the property, the respondents, in law, have a claim against the developer. The respondents have no basis to argue that the SPA had been frustrated. The reason for this is rather simple. The respondents cannot rely on self-induced frustration to avoid the contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;57.;;">Section 57(2) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> enacts as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The word "impossible" is not defined in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;;">Contracts Act 1950</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;57.;;">Section 57(2) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> envisages the situation where the contract becomes frustrated. Frustration puts an end to the contract. Frustration arises after the formation of the contract. The party who seeks to rely on frustration must be a party who is not at fault and no blame can be imputed to him. Lord Radcliffe in <i>Davis Contractors Ltd v. Fareham Urban District Council</i> [1956] AC 696 sets out the test to determine frustration at p 729 of the report in these erudite terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Lord Radcliffe's popular test on frustration in <i>Davis Contractors Ltd v. Fareham Urban District Council (supra)</i> receives recognition in a number of cases subsequent thereto. Thus, it was duly applied in the following cases:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Lord Simon of Glaisdale in <i>National Carriers Ltd v. Panalpina (Northern) Ltd (supra)</i>, aptly said at p 700 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Abdul Hamid Omar FCJ (later the Lord President of the Supreme Court) in <i>Ramli Zakaria &amp; Ors v. The Government Of Malaysia (supra)</i>, at p 375, stated the law lucidly in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The scope of s 56 of the Indian Contract Act 1872 which is equivalent to our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;57.;;">s 57 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> was examined by the Indian Supreme Court in <i>Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur &amp; Co And Another</i> [1954] SCR 310. There, Mukherjea J had this to say at pp 317 to 318 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> However, it must be borne in mind that "the doctrine of frustration is to be confined to very narrow circumstances, the reason being, I think, that commercial bargains should not be lightly avoided or brushed aside merely upon a change of circumstances" (per Abdul Malik Ishak JC in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1992_4_446;"><i>Ooi Yoke In &amp; Anor v. Public Finance Berhad</i> [1992] 4 MLRH 446</LINK>; [1993] 2 CLJ 464). And where the doctrine of frustration applies, the court will not grant specific performance (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1982_1_301;"><i>Chong Wan Kum v. Wan Choong</i> [1982] 1 MLRH 301</LINK>; [1983] CLJ 512).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> It is trite law that a "self-induced frustration" does not discharge a party of his contractual obligations. In this connection, reference should be made to the following cases:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The doctrine of frustration does not protect a party whose own breach of the contract brings about the frustrating event. Thus, a charterer who in breach of the contract, orders a ship into the war-zone, thereby causing the ship to be detained, cannot rely on the detention as a ground of frustration. It is in fact a self-induced frustration (<i>Ocean Tramp Tankers Corporation v. V/O Sovfracht, The Eugenia</i> [1964] 2 QB 226 and <i>Uni-Ocean Lines Pte Ltd v. C-Trade SA (The "Lucille")</i> [1984] 1 Lloyd's Law Reports 244). And according to LP Thean JA in <i>Lim Kim Som v. Sheriffa Taibah bte Abdul Rahman</i> [1994] 1 SLR 393 at p 403, the doctrine of frustration is dependent on the facts of the case. Everything boils down to the facts of the case. The present appeal is not an exception.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Now, if the master title to the whole of Lot 1 Complex at the JB Waterfront City is sold by Public Bank Berhad in a foreclosure proceeding and the property in question is not excluded from the sale, then the SPA between the developer and the respondents becomes impossible to perform because the developer could no longer transfer the property to the respondents "free from all registrable encumbrances". This impossibility is within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;57.;;">s 57(2) of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> and is brought about by the respondents' own conduct when they consented to the creation of a charge by the developer on the master title under cl 5.34 of the SPA. That being the case, based on the facts unfolded, the respondents cannot now claim that the SPA has been frustrated. It is germane, at this juncture, to refer to the speech of Lord Sumner in <i>Bank Line, Limited v. Arthur Capel And Company</i> [1919] AC 435, at p 452. There, His Lordship aptly said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> On the facts, the SPA between the developer and the respondents was not frustrated. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the contract did not become impossible to perform due to any supervening event. Rather, according to learned counsel for the appellant, the contract became impossible to perform because of the developer's breach in releasing the property from the charge on the master title, which was occasioned by the respondents' own act of giving consent to the developer to charge the master title or "in any way encumber" the said property. Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that the possibility of the developer defaulting on their loan was expected and cannot be said to be beyond the contemplation of the respondents. We agree with the submissions of learned counsel for the appellant. For the foregoing reasons, in our judgment, both the SPA and the LACA were not frustrated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The next issue to consider would be the legal effect of the LACA in the context of the present appeal. As a loan agreement, the LACA assigned absolutely all the rights, title and interest of the respondents in the SPA to the appellant. That the LACA created an equitable mortgage cannot be doubted and it is supported by the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_2_420;"><i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd</i> [1998] 2 MLRA 420</LINK>; [1998] 3 MLJ 97; [1999] 2 CLJ 917; [1995] 3 AMR 2331, where Peh Swee Chin FCJ writing for the Federal Court had this to say at p 425 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Continuing at p 426, His Lordship aptly said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Finally, still continuing at p 426, His Lordship concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The principles of law enunciated by Peh Swee Chin FCJ in <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd (supra)</i> were vigorously applied by Abdul Malek Ahmad FCJ (later the President of the Court of Appeal) in the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_128;"><i>Phileoallied Bank (Malaysia) Bhd v. Bupinder Singh Avatar Singh &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 128</LINK>; [2002] 2 MLJ 513; [2002] 2 CLJ 621; [1999] 3 AMR 3086.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> To recapitulate, and by way of a summary, Peh Swee Chin FCJ in <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd (supra)</i> laid down the following salient principles of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> It can be surmised from the judgment of Peh Swee Chin FCJ in <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd (supra)</i> that the LACA is nothing more than a security for the loan which the appellant gave to the respondents in order to assist the latter in financing the purchase of the property. EP Ellinger and Eva Lomnicka in their book entitled "<i>Modern Banking Law</i>", 2nd edn, explained the object of securities in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Continuing at p 648 of the same book, the learned authors lucidly explained the difference between a mortgagor who has an equitable interest in the property, just like the present respondents, and a mortgagor who has a legal interest in the property in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Since it is now established by high authority that an assignment is no more than a mere security given by the respondents to the appellant for repayment of the loan (<i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd (supra)</i>), the crucial question of the day that arises for determination is whether there is a total failure of consideration that leads to frustration when the property is lost or destroyed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Here, the respondents bought the property from the developer. The focal point of attention would be the property in question. In the event that the property is destroyed or lost not due to the fault of either party after the contract is signed and so long as the risk has not passed to the purchaser, then the SPA is said to be frustrated in accordance with the case of <i>Taylor v. Caldwell</i> [1863] 3 B &amp; S 826. The law is nicely put by GH Treitel in his book entitled, "<i>The Law of Contract</i>", 9th edn at p 808 in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> In regard to the issue of risk pertaining to the SPA of an immovable property, reference to the case of <i>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd v. John Walker &amp; Sons Ltd</i> [1977] 1 WLR 164, should be made. That was a case where the plaintiff agreed to buy over a warehouse from the defendant for the sum of £1.7 million subject to contract. The warehouse was advertised as suitable for re-development and in the course of negotiations, the plaintiff had inquired of the defendant as to whether the property had been designated as a building of "special architectural or historical interest", and the defendant replied in the negative. On 25 September 1973, a contract was signed between the parties and on the following day, the Department of Environment wrote to the defendant to inform them that the property had been selected for inclusion in the statutory list of buildings described as of "special architectural or historical interest". The plaintiff filed a writ and claimed that the contract should be set aside, <i>inter alia</i>, on the ground of frustration. Plowman VC, at first instance, rejected the argument that the plaintiff's contract had been frustrated. On appeal, Buckley LJ writing a separate judgment had this to say at p 173 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Lawton LJ agreed with Buckley LJ and in dismissing the appeal said in the <i>John Walker's case (supra)</i> at p 175 as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> In context of the present appeal, the principles of law as stated above are equally applicable in construing the contract between the parties. Thus, if a purchaser contracts to purchase from a developer a parcel within a building to be erected on a piece of land, that purchaser is placed in a situation where he faces several foreseeable risks. The foremost would be the possibility that the construction may be abandoned due to the insolvency of the developer. Yet another known and foreseeable risk is the fact that the master title will be charged by the developer to a banking institution for a bridging loan. Consequently, the purchaser runs the risk that his right over his parcel may be subject to the registered charge on the master title. In the event that the developer defaults and fails to pay the chargee, the entire land will be sold in a foreclosure proceeding and to borrow the words of Buckley LJ in the <i>John Walker's case (supra)</i>, "this is a risk of a kind which every purchaser should be regarded as knowing that he is subject to when he enters into his contract of purchase".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Now, when the respondents gave their consent to the developer to charge the master title to Public Bank Berhad, the risk was that the said bank may foreclose the land and their property was a risk which the respondents shouldered, and to borrow the words of Buckley LJ in the <i>John Walker's case (supra)</i>, "any loss that may result from the maturing of that risk is a loss which must lie where it falls". And the fact that the respondents expressly consented to the developer charging the master title to the said bank meant that the respondents were willing to shoulder the risk of foreclosure on the master title in the event that the developer defaulted in paying the loan and the potential loss of the property arising from the foreclosure. In our judgment, this result is within the reasonable contemplation of the respondents in consenting to the creation of the charge pursuant to cl 5.34 of the SPA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> In our judgment, the aforesaid risk did not pass to the appellant under the LACA. It must be emphasised that the LACA is a loan agreement. It is in the nature of a contract between the appellant and the respondents where the appellant agreed to grant to the respondents a loan in exchange for the repayment of that loan with interest. It is as simple as that. It cannot be denied that the purpose of the loan is to partially finance the purchase of the property. But this does not change the fact that the nub of the loan was nothing more than an advance of money by the appellant to the respondents in consideration of its repayment coupled with interest. The root of the loan transaction is not the property itself because the property merely serves as a security for the repayment of the loan. Seen in this context, the LACA cannot be frustrated even if the SPA with the developer is frustrated, which is not the case here. It must be reiterated that the LACA stands independently from the SPA. In our judgment, the performance of the obligations under the LACA does not become impossible even if the SPA between the developer and the respondents is frustrated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> By way of an illustration, let us consider the situation where the appellant had given the loan to the respondents without requiring any security for the loan. And the rest of the facts remain unchanged in that the developer charged the master title to Public Bank Berhad and the property was sold at a public auction. Would the foreclosure on the master title be the reason to declare that the loan agreement between the appellant and the respondents be held to be void on the ground of frustration? The answer would be in the negative because the property is not connected in any way to the loan transaction. Would it make any difference if the property had been taken as a security? Bearing in mind that the property is used only as security for the re-payment of the loan, then in the event that the security is lost due to no fault of the appellant, why should the appellant lose the right to recover the loan? Why must the loan contract between the appellant and the respondents be deemed frustrated? Would the appellant's position be better off if it did not take the assignment? With due respect, that would simply be absurd.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> In a transaction of this kind, only the benefit of the SPA will be assigned to the banker as security for the repayment of the loan. The obligations and risks under the SPA remain with the purchaser or, like this case, only with the respondents. This is expressly provided for in cl 7 of the LACA which reads as follows (see p 130 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> According to the Federal Court case of <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd (supra)</i>, there is no out-and-out purchase in an assignment of this nature and that the usual rule in law that the risk of the property passes upon execution of the SPA does not apply to the LACA. It must be borne in mind that the LACA is not a sale agreement for the property and that being the case, the risk in the property never passed to the appellant. This approach is reflected in cl 7 of the LACA which clearly stipulates that the respondents shall continue to be liable under the SPA with the developer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> It is our judgment that even if the property was lost or destroyed, that fact does not and cannot frustrate the LACA. With respect, the learned High Court Judge erred in law when Her Ladyship held that the LACA was frustrated because of the foreclosure proceedings on the master title. Her Ladyship failed to consider the settled legal position pertaining to the nature and effect of the LACA transactions together with the rights, liabilities and risks of the various parties in transactions of this nature.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Learned counsel for the respondents made reference to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2006_1_632;"><i>Arab Malaysian Bank Bhd v. Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2006] 1 MLRH 632</LINK>; [2006] 6 MLJ 339; [2006] 3 CLJ 742, a decision of another High Court, which was relied by the learned High Court Judge and argued that at the time when the property was assigned by the respondents to the appellant, the property was not charged by the developer to Public Bank Berhad as yet and, consequently, it was not subject to any order for sale. Learned counsel for the respondents further argued that since the order for sale dated 7 October 2003 is still valid and binding, and the learned High Court Judge found that the property is caught in the order for sale and is not excluded, the property would be sold by public auction to repay the debts due and owing to Public Bank Berhad. That being the case, so it was argued, that whatever assignment executed by the appellant would be rendered meaningless and of no value whatsoever.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> It was further argued by learned counsel for the respondents that the property will be sold by public auction to repay the developer's debts of more than RM16 million as at 7 October 2003 to Public Bank Berhad and, consequently, any re-assignment executed by the appellant will only be in form and of no substance whatsoever.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Now, the learned High Court Judge relied heavily on the case of
<i>Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, in arriving at the decision that the LACA had been frustrated. The facts in that case may briefly be stated as follows. It concerned a loan agreement cum assignment in favour of Arab Malaysian Bank Bhd as security for a term loan. That assignment was in respect of a condominium which the borrower purchased from a developer. However, the developer later sold the condominium to a third party. When Arab Malaysian Bank Bhd sued the borrower to recover the term loan, the borrower counterclaimed and argued that the loan contract had been frustrated due to a total failure of consideration. At p 636 of the report, the High Court had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Clause 50 of the agreement which the High Court referred to in the above mentioned passage was reproduced at p 634 of the report and it was worded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In <i>Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, the High Court ruled that the loan agreement cum assignment was frustrated because the fundamental term for the bank "to reassign the condominium has become impossible even if the full sum due is paid". With respect, this conclusion is erroneous. The correct legal position may be stated as follows. When a property is reassigned to a borrower, it means that the bank executes a document relinquishing its security over the property. It cannot be equated with an obligation on the part of the bank to deliver title or possession of the property to the borrower. It is the developer who is obliged to deliver the property to the borrower after construction of the property and issuance of the strata/individual title. In the present appeal, this fact is borne out in cl 6.3 of the SPA which reads as follows (see pp 239 to 240 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 3):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> Under the SPA, it is the developer who is obliged to deliver the title to the purchaser and that responsibility cannot be passed to the banker.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The High Court in <i>Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, found it difficult to accept the fact that the borrowers who have paid the loan and interest to the bank would end up losing the property. The High Court felt that this situation was not fair to the borrower. While we acknowledge that the situation was unfair to the borrower, we cannot hold the bank responsible for the loss in such cases. To do so would be equally unfair to the bank. The party who must be held responsible in such cases would be the developer. Although it is tempting to hold the bank to be responsible for the loss in such cases based on the common belief that banks have deep pockets and are financially strong, yet both law and policy dictate against pinning the loss to the banks.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> If the courts were to hold that the developers' obligations under a sale and purchase agreement are to be shouldered by the bankers, banks will refuse to finance property where there is no strata/individual title issued. Why should the bank finance property under construction if the bank is to be held liable for breaches by the developer such as insolvency resulting in the abandonment of the project or foreclosure proceeding undertaken by the registered chargee in respect of the master title? In such a situation, banks would simply take the stand that financing would only be made available where there is title that can be transferred to the borrower and the charge registered in favour of the bank. If the banks start to do this, the economy would collapse. The whole construction industry in the country will be in turmoil. Developers will have to complete construction and secure the issuance of the strata/individual title before they can sell the units without financing from banks. The bulk of the purchasers would not be able to purchase these units. In this regard, the views expressed by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_2_491;"><i>Low Lee Lian v. Ban Hin Lee Bank Bhd</i> [1996] 2 MLRA 491</LINK>; [1997] 1 MLJ 77; [1997] 2 CLJ 36; [1997] 1 AMR 1036, are germane to the occasion at hand. At p 499, this was what the Federal Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> If banks are to be held liable by the court for the defaults of developers under the sale and purchase agreements where the banks are not a party to, such decision by the court would give rise to the unhappy situation the Federal Court has alluded to in <i>Low Lee Lian's case (supra)</i>. It is for this reason that the decision of <i>Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, goes off tangent and is inconsistent with the judgment of the Federal Court in <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd (supra)</i>. In our judgment, <i>Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> was wrongly decided. The High Court in <i>Strategi Cerah Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> was patently wrong when it held that the main purpose of the loan agreement was "obviously to finance the purchase of the units by the defendants" and that "the consideration for the agreement is therefore the assigned units". With due respect, it is obvious that a banker gives a loan in consideration of its repayment with interest. And the purpose for which the borrower takes the loan is not the consideration for the loan transaction. To hold otherwise would be absurd as it runs counter to law and commerce.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> Next, we will consider the issue of whether the release of the security was and still is legally possible. For starters, we have this to say. That the crux of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge centred on the point that the LACA had been frustrated because it was impossible for the appellant to perform its obligation to reassign the property pursuant to clause 37 of the LACA. With respect, this finding is wrong in law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> Clause 37 of the LACA reads as follows (see p 150 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 2):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> We must highlight the following facts. That at the time the assignment was created, the property did not exist. The property was not constructed as yet. What was in existence was the SPA between the developer and the respondents. The assignment of the property was only in regard to the assignment of all the respondents' rights, title and interest in the SPA to the appellant. This is clearly reflected in cl 7 of the LACA which stipulates that the "Assignor hereby absolutely assigns to the bank the said property and the full and entire benefit of the sale agreement together with all rights, title and interest of the Assignor therein".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2005_1_422;"><i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Goh Sin Khai</i> [2005] 1 MLRH 422</LINK>; [2005] 3 MLJ 154; [2005] 3 CLJ 24; [2005] 3 AMR 469 explained the legal effect of the deed of assignment in these trenchant terms (see pp 431-432 of the report):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> Another High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_4_306;"><i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Sum-Projects (Brothers) Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 4 MLRH 306</LINK>; [2012] 7 MLJ 39; [2010] 7 CLJ 1010 added mileage and further reinforced and explained the legal ramifications of the deed of assignment at pp 311 to 312 of the report:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The High Court cases of <i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Goh Sin Khai (supra)</i> and <i>Hong Leong Bank Bhd v. Sum-Projects (Brothers) Sdn Bhd (supra)</i> are consistent with the Federal Court case of <i>Chuah Eng Khong v. Malayan Banking Bhd (supra)</i> in that there is no out-and-out purchase of the property by the financier pursuant to the assignment. The assignment merely transfers the chose in action to the banker. And once the loan has been fully repaid, that chose in action is capable of being retransferred or reassigned to the borrower.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> For these varied reasons, the learned High Court Judge erred in holding that the appellant could no longer satisfy the requirements of cl 37 of the LACA in order to release the security. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant was always, and still is, capable of reassigning the chose in action that had been assigned to it, back to the respondents. When the learned High Court Judge equated the chose in action with physical property, Her Ladyship gravely erred. In reality, what was assigned were the rights under the SPA with the developer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> Next, we will consider whether the property was lost. We reiterate that the appellant cannot be held liable in law if the property was lost. However, based on the evidence relied upon by the learned High Court Judge, the property was, in fact, not lost. In her grounds of judgment, Her Ladyship had this to say at pp 28 to 30 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> Continuing further at p 30 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1, the learned High Court Judge in her grounds of judgment had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> At p 35 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1, the learned High Court Judge in her grounds of judgment, which was reproduced earlier in this judgment, alluded to the order for sale obtained by Public Bank Berhad which included the property in question and which has rendered the LACA void. Her Ladyship held that it was now impossible for the appellant to reassign the property even if the full sum due is paid. According to Her Ladyship, the order for sale is still valid and subsisting and although the appellant had applied to intervene, there was no order excluding the property from the order for sale. But, with respect, the finding that the property is lost because the order for sale obtained by Public Bank Berhad still subsists is inconsistent with the order made by Justice Kang Hwee Gee dated 14 August 2008. It must be recalled that the order by Justice Kang Hwee Gee dated 14 August 2008 was for the liquidators to obtain approval from the regulatory authorities for the sale of the entire development to new purchasers. And that the proceeds of the sale were to be used to pay off the amount owing to Public Bank Berhad under the charge and secure the release of the respondents' property. And if these conditions were not met, then the application to intervene and set aside the order for sale will be reinstated and fixed for hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> It is crystal clear that the High Court had not made any decision on the application to intervene and set aside the order for sale. Although the order for sale may still be subsisting, it is apparent that the directions of Justice Kang Hwee Gee showed that the order was kept in abeyance pending the disposal of the development by the liquidator to a third party. With this background scenario, it was certainly premature to conclude that the property was lost. At this juncture, reference to the High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_6_742;"><i>Malayan Banking Bhd v. Tonyin Fast Food Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 6 MLRH 742</LINK> should be made. That was a case where the defendants claimed that the bank had lost the security due to the order for sale obtained by Public Bank Berhad. This was what the High Court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> In <i>Malayan Banking Bhd v. Tonyin Fast Food Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, the High Court rightly emphasised that the question of priorities between the assignment and the registered charge is a matter that has to be determined by the court. And until the court makes a decision that the charge takes priority over the assignment, there is no basis to conclude that the property was lost. It is in this context that the learned High Court Judge, in the present appeal before us, erred when Her Ladyship held otherwise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> To recapitulate, we have this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> A final point to be considered would relate to the issue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> which was overlooked by the learned High Court Judge. Her Ladyship committed a serious error of law when she applied <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;66.;;">s 66 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> in isolation without reading it together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>. While <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_136;66.;;">s 66 of the Contracts Act 1950</LINK> spells out the general consequences when a contract is said to be void, the consequences of frustration of a contract as set out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> cannot be ignored. In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_1_690;"><i>Lin Wen-Chih &amp; Anor v. Pacific Forest Industries Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2008] 1 MLRA 690</LINK>; [2008] 6 MLJ 89; [2008] 5 CLJ 29, James Foong JCA (later FCJ), aptly said at p 693 that, "When the agreement is discharged by frustration, then <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> applies".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">Section 15(1) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> enacts as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> Thus, it is clear from <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15(1) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> that when a contract is frustrated, then subsections (2) to (6) shall come into play. It must be recalled that while the learned High Court Judge found that the LACA had been frustrated, Her Ladyship did not find that the sale and purchase agreement between the developer and the respondents had been frustrated.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> Proceeding ahead, we must now reproduce <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15(2) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>. It is worded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> Subsection (2) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> in clear language states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> At this juncture, it is appropriate to set out the orders of the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> The first order made by the learned High Court Judge was when her Ladyship ordered the appellant to refund the sum of RM151,900.00 being part of the purchase price paid by the respondents to the developer. With due respect, there was no basis whatsoever for the learned High Court Judge to make this order. The sale and purchase agreement between the respondents and the developer was a separate contract and the respondents paid the sum of RM151,900.00 to the developer directly under that contract. Her Ladyship did not make any finding that this contract had been frustrated and even if she did, under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15(2) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK>, it is the developer and not the appellant that would be liable to refund the sum of RM151,900.00 to the respondents. And since this sum was never paid by the respondents to the appellant under the LACA (it must be recalled that Her Ladyship held that the LACA had been frustrated), the respondents were not entitled under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15(2) of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> to recover that sum. It is thus crystal clear that the learned High Court Judge erred in law when Her Ladyship ordered the appellant to refund the sum of RM151,900.00 to the respondents. Consequently, in our judgment, the first order of Her Ladyship must be set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> The second order made by the learned High Court Judge pertained to the order that the appellant refund to the respondents the sum of RM355,409.00 being the instalments paid by the respondents to the appellant under the LACA. It must be recalled that under the LACA, the appellant had granted the term loans to the respondents to enable them to pay for the purchase of the shop unit which they bought from the developer. The LACA stipulated that the appellant must disburse the term loans to the developer. In fact, this was the expense which the appellant incurred in the performance of the LACA prior to frustration. The total sum which the appellant disbursed to the developer was RM450,000.00 and this was the total expense which the appellant incurred in the performance of the LACA prior to frustration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[88]</b> It is quite apparent that the learned High Court Judge ignored the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_67;15.;;">s 15 of the Civil Law Act 1956</LINK> when she made the aforesaid orders. For these reasons, <i>inter alia</i>, the appeal should be allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[89]</b> For these varied reasons, we unanimously allowed the appeal with costs of RM50,000.00 here and below. We set aside the order of the High Court at Johor Bahru and we made an order that the respondents return to the appellant the sum of RM507,309.00 paid by the appellant to the respondents pursuant to the order of the High Court. We also allowed the appellant's claim as reflected in paras 9(a) to 9(d) of the statement of claim at pp 44 to 45 of the Appeal Record at Jilid 1. Deposit to be refunded to the appellant.</p>
