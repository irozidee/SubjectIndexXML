    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff/appellant claimed that the defendant/respondent acting as solicitors on her behalf in a sale and purchase agreement ('SPA') negligently advised her on the termination of the SPA. The SPA was executed between the appellant and one Badardin for the purchase of her shares in a company for a sum of RM1.5 million. Badardin paid RM200,000 as deposit and a further sum of RM350,000. However, he failed to pay the balance sum of RM950,000, which led to the termination of the SPA. The appellant claimed that she meant to secure and receive the said sum and that by reason of the termination thereof, she lost her right of specific performance and/or damages. She was only entitled to the forfeiting of the deposit paid. The learned judge found that the respondent acted in accordance with instructions of the appellant and was therefore not negligent. The claim was therefore dismissed. The appellant now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal in part:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> An advocate and solicitor in determining a cause of action to be taken must act on instructions from the client. However, those instructions are predicated on sound and reasoned advice from the advocate and solicitor in question. In the present case the respondent failed to explain to the appellant the legal implications of the situation. The respondent was well aware that the appellant was a layperson who steadfastly believed she would be able to claim the RM950,000. The learned judge failed to appreciate the broader scope of the duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellant and the adequacy of advice rendered by the respondent, on which the appellant based her instructions. In the circumstances, the respondent had breached its duty of care to the appellant. (paras 5-7)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The appellant failed to establish that she was entitled to the sum of RM950,000 if the respondent had properly advised her. The appellant also failed to show that she took steps to mitigate the loss claimed. The said shares remained with the appellant. No attempt was made to resell the shares to mitigate losses. No evidence was led to show that the value of the said shares dropped and/or the marketability of the said shares had been affected. The appellant's statement of claim clearly stated that she was entitled to forfeit the deposit sum paid by Badardin and there was an order for the said sum to be forfeited. In the circumstances, the appellant had failed to prove damages. (paras 13-19)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>

    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JHC:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal arises out of a judgment of the High Court Shah Alam dismissing the plea of negligence against the respondent and ensuing damages therein. For purposes of convenience, the appellant will be referred to as the plaintiff and the respondent as the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The material facts relevant to the present appeal are set out as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Issues relating to the appeal.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Alleged negligence of the defendant.</p>
    <p>Having evaluated the exchange of correspondence (see p 172 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 4 Bahagian D) and emails it is clear that the defendant had advised the plaintiff on steps and consequences flowing from cls 6.11 and 7.4 of the said agreement. Despite being aware that the plaintiff's predominant purpose was to secure and receive the RM950,000.00 (at pp 631-632 Rekod Rayuan Jilid 4 Bhg C) yet the defendant had advised termination of the said agreement which excluded the right of specific performance and/or damages <i>in lieu</i>. As it now stands the plaintiff was now only entitled to the forfeiting of the deposit paid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> An advocate and solicitor in determining a cause of action to be taken, must act on instructions from the client. However those instructions are predicated on sound and reasoned advice from the advocate and solicitor in question. Lord Salmon in the case of <i>Saif Ali v. Sydney Mitchell &amp; Co</i> reported in [1980] AC p 198 at 218 said and I quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We also quote Brooke J in <i>Edwards v. Lee</i> reported in [1991] 141 NLJ p 1517 who held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> In our present case we find the defendant had failed to explain to the plaintiff the legal implications of this situation. The defendant should have explained to the plaintiff the steps being taken and should have been alert to a danger of misapprehension on the part of the plaintiff, and should have been willing to clarify with the plaintiff the nature of the advice given and the advice itself as the defendant was well aware that the plaintiff was a layperson who steadfastly believed she would be able to claim the RM950,000.00. In the case of <i>Credit Lyonnais SA v. Russell Jones &amp; Walker (a firm),</i> Laddie J reported in [2003] Lloyd's Rep PN 7 Laddie J said at para 21 and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The learned judge in his Grounds of Judgment found that the defendant had acted in accordance with instructions of the plaintiff and was therefore not negligent. The learned judge failed to appreciate the broader scope of the duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff and the adequacy of advice rendered by the defendant, on which the plaintiff based her instructions and took a rather simplistic approach to the issue. We find that the defendant had breached its duty of care to the plaintiff and we therefore allowed the appeal on liability.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff raised the issue of damages and argued that as a consequence of the breach of duty of the defendant to the plaintiff, ie advising the plaintiff to terminate the said agreement thus depriving the plaintiff of a remedy of specific performance and/or damages <i>in lieu</i> thereof, the plaintiff should be entitled to a sum of RM950,000.00 because of failure to properly advise the plaintiff on the effects of cls 6.11 and 7.4 of the said agreement, that sum being the balance purchase price.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Had the defendant rendered proper advice, the plaintiff would not be precluded from pursuing a claim for specific performance and/or damages <i>in lieu</i> which would be in the region of RM950,000.00 ie the balance purchase price which the plaintiff had the opportunity to claim for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Firstly, it must be borne in mind that the plaintiff's pleaded case against the defendant is in negligence. To suggest that the plaintiff would be able to recover the sum of RM950,000.00 as a consequence of the defendant's breach is not the test applied for the measure of damages in tort. The general rule is the plaintiff must be compensated on a "<i>restitutio in integrum</i>" basis, ie to put the plaintiff back to the position before the breach of the duty of care took place. The award of damages must be reasonable between the plaintiff and the defendant. It had to take into account a variety of matters and the most important factor is the said shares sold remained in the hands of the plaintiff. In <i>Hotson v. East Berkshire Health Authority</i> reported in [1987] 1 AC p 750 at p 762, Hammond J in the Court of Appeal thought it better to concentrate on what actually did happen: "A great many solicitor's negligence cases, as to damages turn on "what if" questions. However, the measure of damages is simply what it costs to remove the blot for the clean title which Mr Benton thought he was getting." As the said shares remain with the plaintiff, the principle of damages assessed as referred to aforesaid does not apply.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> As to the quantification of damages the plaintiff must show that she had suffered loss due to the negligent advice of the defendant. It is sometimes a difficult line to cross where causation leading to liability for loss ends and quantification of the amount of the loss begins. It has to be shown by evidence although the plaintiff was very keen to secure the sum of RM950,000.00 can it be said with certainty the quantum of damages would amount to RM950,000.00 or that the court would have ordered damages <i>in lieu</i> of specific performance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We refer to the decision of Court of Appeal England in the case of <i>Allied Maples Group Ltd v. Simmons &amp; Simmons</i> reported in [1995] 1 WLR 1602 p 1609 and we quote the relevant parts of His Lordship Stuart Smith's judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> In assessing damages, the plaintiff had failed to establish that she would be entitled to the sum of RM950,000.00 on the basis that she would have been entitled to claim that amount if the defendant had properly advised the plaintiff. This proposition is fraught with speculation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The plaintiff had also failed to show that she took steps to mitigate the loss claimed as she had failed to take reasonable steps to minimise the alleged loss suffered. The plaintiff will not be able to claim any damages due to lack of reasonable steps on the plaintiff's part. This principle is equally applicable in claims for contract and tort. (See Norchaya Talib, <i>Law on Torts</i>, p 398)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Even though the defendant is generally fully liable for the damage sustained by the plaintiff, the plaintiff has a corresponding duty to minimise her loss. For instance, if a plaintiff loses his job due to injuries, he should look for alternative employment if he is still capable of working. If he takes a lower paid job, he can only recover from the defendant as lost wages, the difference between his previous and his present earnings. If the value of his damaged property is say, RM50 a plaintiff cannot claim, for instance, RM80 as repair costs, when buying a similar new item would only cost him RM50.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The plaintiff will not be able to claim as damages, any loss that she has incurred due to lack of reasonable steps on her part. What is reasonable depends on the facts and circumstances in each case. Where however, the reasonable steps taken to minimise the consequences of the defendant's tort actually increases the plaintiff's final loss, the increased expenses and loss would still be attributable to the defendant's tort and may be fully recovered from the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Taking the following into consideration the court is of the view the plaintiff had failed to mitigate her loss (if any) in that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In this regards during the cross-examination the plaintiff (PW1) testified as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> For all the aforesaid reasons we find the plaintiff had failed to show that damages were suffered by the plaintiff. On the upshot:</p>
