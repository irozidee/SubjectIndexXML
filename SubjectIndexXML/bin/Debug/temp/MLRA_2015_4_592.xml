    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant purchased a piece of land ("the property") at a public auction and received the requisite Form 16F Certificate under the National Land Code ("the Code"). The property was 40.3 hectares thereby bringing it within the purview of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Code</LINK>. The Registrar of Land Titles ("the Registrar") however refused to register the transfer of the property to the appellant on the basis that there was no approval by the Estate Land Board ("ELB"), whose approval was required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Code</LINK>. The appellant appealed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;418.;;">s 418 of the Code</LINK> to the High Court but the appeal was dismissed. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs</p>
    <p>Per Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The clear terms of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A(10A)(b) of the Code</LINK> that the execution of an agreement to convey or dispose of property without approval of the ELB are conclusive proof that the estate land is conveyed or disposed of in contravention of subsection (1), means that the approval must be obtained before such an agreement is executed. (para 8)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> An imbroglio occurs when a chargee seeks an order for sale. The chargee cannot make a joint application with a purchaser for the reason no purchaser is identified at that stage of the application for an order for sale. Likewise, the auction. The chargee cannot apply together with a purchaser for the reason the auction itself is to identify the purchaser. But a successful bid, thus identifying the purchaser, itself becomes a binding agreement, rendering the parties on the face of it to be in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Code</LINK>. Such an interpretation, though on the face of it correct, overlooks the fact <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Code</LINK> when incorporated into the Code was placed in Part Fourteen of the Land Code as to transfers, and to which <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">s 267(1)(b) of the Code</LINK> provides that the relevant provisions of the Part shall apply as if the chargor had transferred the land or leased to the purchaser in accordance with the provisions of that Part. (paras 10-11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Though transfer, conveyance or disposal of estate land are prohibited without prior approval of the Estate Land Board, nothing prohibits such land from being charged as security. Furthermore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">s 267 of the code</LINK> is a specific provision in respect of effect of an order for sale granted upon an application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the code</LINK>. Since <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> is part of Part Fourteen of the Code, the words "as if the chargor had transferred the land or lease to the purchaser in accordance with the provisions of that Part" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">s 267(1)(b)</LINK>, means that an approval of the ELB under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Code</LINK> is unnecessary in the case of a sale under an order for sale by the court. (para 12)</p>
    <p>Per Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> What was in issue before the High Court was whether the Registrar should have accepted the Certificate of sale pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;301.;;">s 301 of the Code</LINK> for the purpose of registration when <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A(2) of the Code</LINK> requires a certificate of approval from the ELB for registration. What was not considered by the court was the principle laid down by the Federal Court that all orders of court must be obeyed by the relevant parties, unless the order is set aside, a much entrenched principle in Malaysian jurisprudence. (para 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the certificate of sale and/or order for sale had not been set-aside by the respondent and/or other relevant bodies. If the respondent and/or relevant authorities were aggrieved by the order of sale and/or certificate of sale, they had a duty and an obligation to make the necessary application to the court to set aside the order. However, what they could not do was refuse to comply with an order of court. <i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd (folld)</i>. (para 18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Code</LINK> did not permit estate land to be transferred, conveyed or disposed off in any manner. Further, the title to one of the lots was endorsed with a restriction prohibiting the land from being transferred, charged or mortgaged without the consent of the State Authority. The fact that it had been charged and the charge registered on the face of the record showed that the State Authority must have consented and also knew the consequence that if the charge conditions were breached, the chargee had the right to sell the property to a third party. All interested parties relating to the State Authority knew of the consequence. If objection of the State Authority is to be taken in reliance of the endorsement or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK>, it must be taken at the earliest opportunity. That was not done in the instant case. (paras 23-24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the State Authority fully knew or ought to have known from the date the consent to charge was allowed and/or registered the consequence of the breach by the chargor(s) if the repayment under the charge was not made. It would be abhorrent to the notion of justice and fair play for the State Authority and/or its agency to refuse registration. A responsible State Authority should help to facilitate registration, and where necessary provide the certificate of ELB as of right on the facts of the instant case. Nothing in the instant case was done in secret to defeat the law. Technical objections of such nature should not be allowed to prevail in view of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;292.;;">ss 292</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">267 of the Code</LINK> as well as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;297.;;">ss 297</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;269.;;">269</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;300.;;">300</LINK>, in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;299.;;">s 299 of the Code</LINK>. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant case, the High Court judge had literally interpreted <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">ss 214A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;301.;;">301 of the Code</LINK>. However, literal interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> as well as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;301.;;">s 301</LINK>, without balancing other provisions of the Code or Acts, case laws, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> as well as the common sense approach relating to justice, equity and good conscience would result in a perverse judgment. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> This was a fit and proper case to allow the appeal and direct the registration of the property within 60 working days from the date of the order with a direction that the respondent and/or the State Authority and/or agencies facilitate registration according to law. (para 30)</p>

      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/plaintiff Damai Jaya Realty Sdn Bhd appealed against the dismissal by the High Court of its appeal to that court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;418.;;">s 418 of the National Land Code ("the Land Code")</LINK> against the refusal of the Registrar of Land Titles, Selangor ("the Registrar") to register a transfer of land ("the subject property") to the appellant/plaintiff pursuant to a Certificate of sale by court in Form 16F ("the Form 16F Certificate") under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;259.;;">s 259 of the Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The subject property was sold by auction pursuant to an application for an order for sale by a chargee under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256 of the Land Code</LINK>. Having (a) succeeded to purchase the property at the auction; and (b) paid the full amount of the purchase price, the appellant/plaintiff received the requisite Form 16F Certificate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The Registrar, however, refused to register the appellant/plaintiff for the reason that there was no approval by the Estate Land Board, whose approval was required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Land Code</LINK>. The refusal by the Registrar stems from the fact that the land area of the subject property is 40.3 hectares, thereby bringing it within the purview of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>

Master Pyrodor Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 6 MLRA 713</LINK>; [2014] 6 MLJ 341; [2014] 9 CLJ 74, it was held that the use of the words "desiring to transfer ..." and "to whom the land is to be transferred, ..." in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A(4)</LINK> clearly meant that the obtaining of the approval must be done before the execution of the agreement by which the land would be conveyed or disposed of. Although it held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> requires approval be obtained before the agreement is executed, the Court of Appeal remitted the matter to the High Court for the plaintiff to adduce evidence of such approvals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> With respect, we hold the view that the clear terms of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A(10A)(b)</LINK>, that the execution of an agreement to convey or dispose of such property without approval of the Estate Land Board is conclusive proof that the estate land is conveyed or disposed of in contravention of subsection (1), means that the approval must be obtained before an agreement is executed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On the face of it, the Registrar acted correctly under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Land Code</LINK>. An application in Form 14D should have been made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK>, and an approval of such transfer, conveyance or disposal conveyed by the Secretary of the Board produced to the Registrar.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> None of the reported cases, however, concern a transfer under the Form 16F Certificate. An imbroglio begins when a chargee seeks an order for sale, for it cannot make a joint application with a purchaser for the reason no purchaser is identified at the stage of the application for an order for sale. Likewise the auction. The chargee cannot possibly apply together with a purchaser for the reason the auction itself is to identify the purchaser. But a successful bid, thus identifying the purchaser, itself becomes a binding agreement, rendering the parties on the face of it to be in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Land Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Such an interpretation, though on the face of it is correct, overlooks the fact <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> when incorporated into the Land Code was placed in Part Fourteen of the Land Code as to transfers, and it is specifically provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">s 267(1)(b)</LINK> that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Though transfer, conveyance or disposal of estate land are prohibited without prior approval of the Estate Land Board, nothing prohibits such land from being charged as security. Furthermore, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">s 267</LINK> is a specific provision in respect of effect of an order for sale granted upon an application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;256.;;">s 256</LINK>. Since <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> is part of Part Fourteen of the Land Code, the words "as if the chargor had transferred the land or lease to the purchaser in accordance with the provisions of that Part" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">s 267(1)(b)</LINK>, means that an approval of the Estate Land Board under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A of the Land Code</LINK> is unnecessary in the case of a sale under an order for sale by the court. This interpretation avoids the imbroglio described in para 10 above as it no longer arises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We confine ourselves to the foregoing reasons to allow the appeal with costs at RM10,000.00, set aside the order of the High Court and direct the registration pursuant to the Form 16F Certificate within 60 days of this order.

In my view, one important issue fundamental to the rule of law and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> in relation to order of court and its compliance has arisen in the instant case and needs to be deliberated. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909]. This is my judgment allowing the appeal.

      <b>Preliminary And Jurisprudence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The issue here involves Estate Land. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">Section 214A of the NLC</LINK> does not promote the fragmentation of the Estate Land without the approval of the ELB. ELB comes within the compass of State Authority. The appellant has purchased Estate Land at public auction through the order for sale of a charged property. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A(11)</LINK>, Estate Land means any agricultural land held under one or more title which is more than 40 hectares. It is not in dispute that the land in question is about 40.3 hectares and it is an estate land. What was in issue before the High Court was whether the respondent should have accepted the Certificate of Sale pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;301.;;">s 301 of the NLC</LINK> for the purpose of registration when <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A(2)</LINK> requires a certificate of approval of ELB for registration. What was not considered by the court was the principle laid down by the Federal Court that all orders of Court must be obeyed by the relevant parties (unless the order is set aside), a principle which is much entrenched in our jurisprudence. (See <i>Hadkinson v. Hadkinson</i> [1952] 2 All ER 567). It is also well settled the motive for disobedience is irrelevant (<i>R v. Poplar Borough Council (No 2)</i> [1922] 1 KB 95). The failure to act and decide as enunciated by the Federal Court on the face of record is bad under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>, as it compromises the authority and jurisdiction of the court and paves way and also stands as a precedent for relevant parties to breach an order of court. The consequence of breach of order of court is a serious matter and amounts to contempt and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> preserves the power of the Superior Court to punish for contempt under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;126.;;"></LINK>art 126 to ensure orders of courts are complied by all, inclusive of all constitutional functionaries and its agencies, etc. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_362;"><i>Nik Noorhafizi Nik Ibrahim &amp; Ors v.

      <b>[23]</b> I have read the Appeal Record and the submissions of the parties in detail. I take the view that the judgment of the High Court must be set aside and direct the respondent to register the property as per the order of court and if necessary it is the responsibility of the State Authority to facilitate registration according to law.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It will follow the property cannot even be charged without the consent of the State Authority and the fact that it had been charged and the charge registered on the face of record will show that the State Authority must have consented and also that the State Authority knew the consequence that if the charge conditions are breached the chargee has the right to sell the property to third party. In essence, all interested parties relating to State Authority knew of the consequence. If objection of the State Authority is to be taken in reliance of the endorsement or <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK>, it must have been taken at the earliest opportunity. That was not done in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">Section 5 of the NLC</LINK> defines the State Authority, which means the Ruler or Governor of the State, and it will follow the State Government of Selangor and all its agencies will fall within its compass of control, subject to the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>, Federal Laws and State Laws. (See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_1_662;"><i>Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya v. Laguna De Bay Sdn Bhd</i> [2015] 1 MLRA 662</LINK>; [2015] 2 MLJ 509; [2015] 1 CLJ 357). <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214.;;">Section 214(3)</LINK> provides for the formation ELB which is controlled by the State Authority through its State Secretary, State Director and four members appointed by the State Authority from amongst the members of the public service. The State Authority under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A(9)</LINK> has ample power to control the decision of the ELB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In the instant case, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;301.;;">s 301</LINK> says 'when an instrument is fit for registration'. It also says that once the Certificate of Sale has been given consent by State Authority relating to restriction in interest to such land will not be applicable. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;2914A.;;">Section 214A</LINK> has been placed in Part Fourteen of the NLC and has nexus to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;292.;;">s 292</LINK> when it relates to registration. Part Nine also fortifies the role of the State Authority in relation to subdivision, partition and amalgamation which has some nexus to the generic word fragmentation. The learned trial judge's proposition that the restriction of interest does not relate to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> without considering Part Nine (subdivision, partition of amalgamation) may not be totally correct taking into consideration <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">ss 267</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;269.;;">269 of NLC</LINK> which guarantee the registration of the property once the Certificate of Sale is issued and also other provisions of Part Eighteen of NLC which imposes a duty on the respondent to facilitate registration. The definition of restriction in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the NLC</LINK> reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> State Authority under the definition means the Ruler, and it is trite that consent on land matter as in the instant case is not obtained from the Ruler but by the State Government and its agencies. In the instant case, the State Authority fully knew or ought to have known from the date the consent to charge was allowed and/or registered the consequence of the breach by the chargor(s) if the repayment under the charge is not made. It will be abhorrent to notion of justice and fair play for the State Authority and/or its agency to refuse registration. A responsible State Authority should help to facilitate registration, and where necessary provide the certificate of ELB as of right on the facts of the instant case. Nothing in the case was done in secret to defeat the law. Technical objection of such nature should not be allowed to prevail in view of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;292.;;">ss 292</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;267.;;">267 of NLC</LINK> as well as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;297.;;">ss 297</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;269.;;">269</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;300.;;">300</LINK> in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;299.;;">s 299 of the NLC</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Part Eighteen deals with registration of dealings as it has 26 sections. It attempts to give protection to the public from administrative abuse as in the instant case. It is the duty of the Registrar to facilitate registration. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;297.;;">Sections 297</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;300.;;">300</LINK> impose a duty on the Registrar to do so. This was not adhered to in the instant case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In the instant case the learned trial judge had made much effort to literally interpret <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> as well as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;301.;;">s 301</LINK>. Literal interpretation of a statute is always subject to rule of law. The hallmark of interpretation and judgment writing in civil cases requires the court to consider justice, equity and good conscience in any decision making process which jurisprudence has been incorporated into our jurisprudence by case laws. (See <i>Debnarayan Dutt v. Chunilal Ghose</i> [1914] ILR 41 Cal 137). Literal interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;214A.;;">s 214A</LINK> as well as <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;301.;;">s 301</LINK>, without balancing other provisions of NLC or Acts, case laws, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK>, etc as well as the common sense approach relating to justice, equity and good conscience will result in a perverse judgment. For example, in the instant case, a purchaser who had paid about RM48.5 million and who had been guaranteed good title for registration under NLC has been prevented by the respondent from registering the property. Justice, equity and good conscience must be a starting and ending point to be considered in all decision making process and it is always subject to rule of law, and where the law is silent, the courts are obliged to deliver judgment according to justice, equity and good conscience, and at all times act within the framework of the rule of law and the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">Federal Constitution</LINK> to preserve the integrity of the decision-making process.
