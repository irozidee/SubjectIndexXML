    <p>The 1st and 2nd appellants were charged for trafficking in 67,202 grams of cannabis, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("Act")</LINK>, read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code ('PC')</LINK>. The drugs were found in the boot of a Mercedes Benz motorcar ("Mercedes"). The appellant faced a second charge, ie for trafficking in 68,270 grams of cannabis found in a special compartment of the Mercedes. Both appellants were convicted and sentenced to death for the first offence. In respect of the second offence, the 1st appellant was acquitted and discharged. The appellants appealed against the convictions and sentences for the first offence whereas the prosecution appealed against the acquittal and discharge of the 1st appellant for the second offence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the 1st and 2nd appellants' appeals; dismissing the prosecution's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Concerning the first offence, apart from the fact that immediately prior to the arrests the 1st appellant was seen driving the Mercedes with the 2nd appellant as the passenger and the fact that both of them later went to the boot of the Mercedes, there was no other evidence or circumstances from which the knowledge of the drugs in the boot of the Mercedes could be inferred against the appellants. The mere fact that the appellants were in the Mercedes was insufficient to prove knowledge, custody and control and to constitute possession of the drugs. <i>Ibrahim Mohamad &amp; Anor v. PP (folld)</i>. (paras 24-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Mere presence, without anything more, was not sufficient to fasten liability of the 2nd appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the PC</LINK>. There must be some facts and circumstances from which an inference could be drawn on the meeting of minds or the pre-arranged plan between the appellants to traffic in dangerous drugs. In this case, there was none. (para 31)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> As provided for in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>, the duty lies upon the trial judge to consider all the evidence which includes the defence, however weak or unreasonable the defence may be. In the instant case, the failure of the trial judge to consider the defence was a serious misdirection, warranting appellate intervention. (para 37)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In respect of the second offence against the 1st appellant, the drugs in the special compartment of the Mercedes were not discovered pursuant to information leading to discovery under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, but rather were recovered by the police with the use of police dogs. The name of the 1st appellant on the Confirmation of Purchase of Insurance as the other named driver of the Mercedes was not, <i>per se</i>, sufficient to prove that the 1st appellant had possession of the drugs found in the Mercedes. (paras 39 &amp; 42)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> On the following facts, namely: (i) that the appellants were not the owners of the Mercedes; (ii) that there was no evidence for how long the 1st appellant had been driving the Mercedes; (iii) that no evidence was adduced as to who had access to the Mercedes prior to the arrest of the appellants; (iv) that there was no physical contact between both the appellants and the two bags containing the cannabis in the boot of the Mercedes (given the evidence of SP4 that the police team had raided the appellants before they could lift the bags); and (v) in the light of the defence, the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. (para 43)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The trial judge had found that the appellants had actual possession of the drugs and had invoked <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> to find trafficking against the appellants. However, having heard the defence, the trial judge failed to make a ruling on whether the appellants had rebutted the presumption of trafficking. This was yet another misdirection warranting appellate intervention. (para 44) </p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant in Appeal No: W-05-227-09-2013 and the appellant in Appeal No: W-05-228-09-2013 were the first accused and the second accused respectively in the High Court. In this grounds of judgment, they will be referred to as the 1st appellant and the 2nd appellant respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 1st and the 2nd appellants were charged for trafficking in dangerous drugs, to wit 67,202 grams of cannabis, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act (the Act) 1952</LINK>, read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK> (the first charge). The drugs forming the subject matter of the first charge were found in the boot of Mercedes Benz registration No PBW 9127 (the Mercedes).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The 1st appellant faced another charge, ie for trafficking in 68,270 grams of cannabis (the second charge). The second charge relates to the cannabis found in the special compartment of the Mercedes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellants were convicted and sentenced to death on the first charge. For the second charge, the 1st appellant was acquitted and discharged. The appellants appealed against the conviction and sentence on the first charge, while the prosecution appealed against the acquittal and discharge of the 1st appellant on the second charge. Hence the three appeals before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We heard the three appeals together at the end of which we allowed the appeals by the appellants against the conviction and sentence and we dismissed the appeal by the prosecution. We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Briefly, the prosecution's case is as follows. Acting on information received, on 4 June 2010, SP9 and his men had tailed a Peugeot driven by the 2nd appellant from Plaza Tol Jalan Duta to the entrance of Danau Impian Condominium (the condominium). The Peugeot stopped at the roadside in front of the entrance of the condominium and shortly, a Mercedes driven by the 1st appellant arrived. The 2nd appellant got into the Mercedes. The Mercedes entered the said condominium where it was parked at the parking lot marked as 448. SP9 and his men followed the Mercedes to the parking lot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Both the appellants alighted from the Mercedes and went into the said condominium block. At about 8pm, both the appellants were seen walking out from the said condominium block, heading towards the Peugeot which was parked by the roadside to the main entrance of the condominium. Both the appellants entered the Peugeot and drove away. The police team followed the Peugeot to Restoran Suraya (the restaurant).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> At the restaurant, the 1st appellant met SP14. SP 14 said that he wanted to purchase RM100.00 worth of cannabis from the 1st appellant. Thereafter, both the appellants got into a Kelisa which was earlier driven by SP14 while SP14 went inside the Peugeot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 2nd appellant then drove the Kelisa with the 1st appellant as the passenger, back to the said condominium. At the condominium, the appellants came out of the Kelisa and went to the boot of the Mercedes. The boot was opened. The appellants were taking out one bag each from the boot of the Mercedes. At that point of time, the raiding parties arrived. Both the appellants were arrested. 70 slabs of cannabis were recovered in two bags from the boot of the Mercedes. The chemist (SP3) confirmed that the cannabis weigh 67,202 grams.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 5 June 2010, after interrogating the 1st appellant, the police found 76 slabs in a special compartment in the Mercedes, which was confirmed by SP3 to be 68,270 grams of cannabis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> At the end of the prosecution case, the learned trial judge made the following finding in respect of the first charge: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> As for the second charge, at para 24 of the grounds of judgment, the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Having found that the prosecution had made out a <i>prima facie</i> case, the learned trial judge called upon the appellants to enter their defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The defence as summarised by learned counsel for the appellants was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The learned trial judge made the following finding in respect of the defence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Specifically on the overheating of the Peugeot and the car-jack, the learned trial judge said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned trial judge went on to consider the conduct of the appellants upon being raided by the police where His Lordship concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Insofar as the second charge against the 1st appellant is concerned, the learned trial judge found: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In respect of the appeals against conviction and sentence relating to the first charge, learned counsel for the appellants argued on the following three grounds:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> As for the appeal by the prosecution against the acquittal and discharge of the 1st appellant in respect of the second charge, learned deputy argued that there was evidence of direct possession and because of the weight of the drugs, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> applies. Even without resorting to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da)</LINK>, learned deputy submitted that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2</LINK> applies (ie the act of keeping the drugs in the car) and that the act of trafficking had been made out.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> For the first charge against both the appellants, the prosecution relied on the fact that the 1st appellant was driving the Mercedes; the negotiation between the 1st appellant and SP14 at the restaurant (allegedly in the presence of the 2nd appellant) and that both the appellants had gone to the boot of the Mercedes and had taken out the bags, to infer knowledge on the part of the appellants of the drugs found in the boot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The prosecution had similarly relied on the fact that the Mercedes was being driven by the 1st appellant and the fact that the 1st appellant's name appeared as the insured for the Mercedes, to sustain the second charge against the 1st appellant. </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Having considered the submissions and the records of appeal, we found merits in the grounds raised by learned counsel for the appellants. </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> On the first charge, apart from the fact that immediately prior to the arrests, the 1st appellant was seen driving the Mercedes with the 2nd appellant as the passenger and the fact that both of them later went to the boot of the Mercedes from the Kelisa, there was no other evidence or circumstances from which knowledge of the drugs in the boot of the Mercedes could be inferred against the appellants.
</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_181;"><i>Ibrahim Mohamad &amp; Anor v. PP</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 181</LINK>; [2011] 6 MLJ 387; [2011] 4 CLJ 113, Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin FCJ (as His Lordship then was) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In our view, the case of <i>Ibrahim Mohamad &amp; Anor (supra)</i> applies to the facts of the present case. The mere fact that the appellants were in the Mercedes was insufficient to prove knowledge, custody and control and to constitute possession of the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The learned trial judge had stated at para 21 of the grounds of judgment that "... T2 tidak boleh dikatakan hanya mengikut T1 ke mana sahaja. Perbuatan beliau memegang salah satu daripada eks P21 dan P52 itu sudah mencukupi bagi menunjukkan beliau turut bekerjasama dengan T1 untuk mengedar dadah berkenaan. Seterusnya T2 telah turut berada bersama-sama dengan T1 untuk berbincang berkenaan pembelian dadah dengan SP14. Sekiranya beliau tiada mempunyai niat yang sama dengan T1, beliau perlu meninggalkan urusan itu dilakukan oleh T1 sahaja." </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> SP4 had stated that (p 299: RR Jld 2):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> There was thus no concrete evidence that the appellants were in fact holding the bags containing the drugs and that both the appellants were trying to avoid the arrests or were running away from the police. From the evidence of SP4, only the 1st appellant resisted arrest (p 299: RR Jld 2). On conduct, SP4 further testified (p 343: RR Jld 2): "7 orang telah keluar serentak dengan senjata masing-masing dan mengacukan ke arah kedua-dua orang di kereta tersebut." To a question by learned counsel during cross-examination (p 345:RR Jld 2) that "perbuatan hendak lari tersebut adalah untuk selamatkan diri, takut apa-apa berlaku pada mereka?" SP4 answered "Ya". In the light of this evidence, we were of the view that conduct of the appellants was not an unequivocal act which was capable of only one interpretation, ie the guilty minds of the appellants. As stated by the Federal Court in <i>Ibrahim Mohamad &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, the conduct could also be a manifestation of the common instinct of self-preservation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The evidence of SP14 in respect of the 1st appellant was: "... malam itu, dia telefon saya kata ada bekalan, pada masa itu selepas Maghrib. Dia kata kalau nak dah "ok". OKT 1 kata tempat itu, jam saya tak ingat. Tujuan jumpa OKT untuk minum dan ambil ganja, saya ambil dalam RM100.00". It must be noted from the above evidence of SP14 that there was no issue of negotiation between him and the 1st appellant on the supply of the drugs when they met at the restaurant. What was apparent was that the purpose of the meeting was for SP14 to take the drugs. It appears therefore that an agreement had been reached for the purchase of RM100.00 worth of cannabis. And if indeed that was the case, ie that the 1st appellant had called SP14 to inform about the ready supply and that SP14 had wanted to take the drugs for RM100.00, why did the 1st appellant meet SP14 without the drugs and why the need for the 1st appellant to come back to the Mercedes for the drugs later as the 1st appellant could have brought the drugs with him when he met SP14 at the restaurant. The sequence of events in our view supports the defence version that the appellants went back to the condominium in the Kelisa because the Peugeot was overheating and they wanted to look for a car-jack in the Mercedes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Further, the evidence of SP14 revealed that the 2nd appellant was not involved in the conversation between SP14 and the 1st appellant at the restaurant. The conversation was only between the 1st appellant and SP14. Given the evidence of SP14, the submission of learned deputy that both the appellants were discussing the supply of cannabis with SP14 is without merit. In any event, mere presence without more will not be sufficient to fasten liability of the 2nd appellant under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Penal Code</LINK>. There must be some facts and circumstances from which an inference could be drawn on the meeting of minds or the pre-arranged plan between the appellants to traffic in dangerous drugs, which in this case, there was none (see <i>State of Orissa v. Raghutan Sahu &amp; Ors</i> [1979] Cri LJ 502 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_1_23;"><i>Krishna Rao Gurumurthi v. PP And Another Appeal</i> [2009] 1 MLRA 23</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 643; [2009] 2 CLJ 603). We also noted the following evidence of SP14 in cross-examination:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Learned deputy had submitted thus at para 11 of p 15 of the written submission: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> As stated above, the evidence of SP14 had negated the involvement of the 2nd appellant during the alleged discussions between SP14 and the 1st appellant on the supply of the drugs. Be that as it may, the evidence of SP14 was in respect of RM100.00 worth of cannabis. That conversation for the supply of RM100.00 of cannabis, if at all it had taken place, did not, in our view, prove the possession by the appellants of 67,202 and 68,270 grams of cannabis in the boot and in the special compartment of the Mercedes respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> SP4 had stated that (p 359:RR Jld 2) "Saya tidak tahu OKT 1 dan OKT 2 tinggal di mana, sebab dia datang ke Kuala Lumpur". SP4 confirmed in cross-examination that the Mercedes came from outside the condominium which is consistent with the evidence of the 1st appellant that he was coming back from sending Azhar to the Old Town White Coffee at Jalan Klang Lama.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The evidence of the 1st appellant fits into the prosecution's version that they were seen driving outside the said condominium (p 497: Rekod Rayuan Jld 2). The 1st appellant had given an account of the circumstances that led him to driving the Mercedes. We agree with learned counsel that the momentary driving cannot be equated with having possession of the drugs (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_297;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Lin Lian Chen</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 297</LINK>).</p>

      <b>[36]</b> In concluding that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, the learned trial judge at para 70 of the grounds of judgment stated that "Pembelaan kedua-dua T adalah suatu rekaan dan "afterthought" mereka sahaja dan tidak boleh dipercayai.". In this regard, we found that the learned trial judge had failed to consider the evidence of the defence witnesses, especially the aspects of the evidence which had explained why the appellants were in the Mercedes and more importantly, the evidence of SD9 on his request for the car-jack. The defence version on the overheating of the Peugeot and the car-jack was put to the material prosecution witness, ie SP14, who had been asked by the 1st appellant to wait inside the Peugeot while the appellants went back to the condominium with the Kelisa to look for a car-jack in the Mercedes. The evidence of Syed Omar, SD9 was most material to support the defence version on the car-jack and the explanation on why the appellants were at the boot of the Mercedes when they were arrested. SD9 was consistent in his evidence. In examination in chief he said "Lebih kurang jam 8.00 malam saya keluar tapi dalam perjalanan itu, saya tersangkut, tayar pancit, masa itu OKT 2 contact saya, saya cakap minta dia cari jack sebab jack saya rosak.". In cross-examination he testified that "Kereta saya pancit di Jalan Kelang Lama, tayar belakang kena paku, car-jack saya rosak. Saya jarang pakai, sebab dia berkarat. ... Saya ada kawan lain, tapi sebab saya plan nak jumpa dia, maka saya minta dia bawa car-jack. Dia suruh tunggu ½ jam".</p>

      <b>[37]</b> As provided for in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;182A.;;">s 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK>, the duty lies on the learned trial judge to consider all the evidence which includes the defence, however weak or unreasonable the defence may be (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_47;"><i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. PP</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 47</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 209; [1996] 1 CLJ 705; [1996] 1 AMR 817 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_11;"><i>Ganapathy Rengasamy v. PP</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 11</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 577; [1998] 2 CLJ 101; [1999] 1 AMR 1). In the instant case, not only did the learned trial judge fail to consider the defence, His Lordship had made an error of fact in stating that the defence had failed to call Syed Omar. In our view, the explanation on the car-jack is not inherently improbable and in failing to consider all the evidence and in particular the evidence of SD9, the appellants had been seriously prejudiced in that the defence had not been given a fair and just assessment. The failure of the learned trial judge to consider the defence is a serious misdirection, warranting appellate intervention (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1993_1_227;"><i>Gooi Loo Seng v. PP</i> [1993] 1 MLRA 227</LINK>; [1993] 2 MLJ 137; [1993] 3 CLJ 1; [1993] 2 AMR 1135).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In respect of the second charge against the 1st appellant, the drugs were purportedly discovered pursuant to the information or statement given by the 1st appellant. Learned deputy submitted that there was direct evidence of possession of the drugs in the special compartment of the Mercedes. It was the submission of learned deputy that given the special compartment, the same type and the large amount of drugs, who could have put it there but the 1st appellant. The learned trial judge found that the statement given by the 1st appellant was a statement leading to discovery, as before the statement was given by the 1st appellant, SP4 had no knowledge of the drugs found in the special compartment of the Mercedes. Having heard the defence however, His Lordship found that it was not safe to convict the 1st appellant based on the statement given by the 1st appellant purportedly leading to the discovery of the drugs in the special compartment of the Mercedes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39</b>] The evidence of SP14 who was present at the car park categorically stated that he saw the use of canines to detect the drugs in the special compartment of the Mercedes. We find that the drugs in the special compartment was not discovered pursuant to the information leading to discovery under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;27.;;">s 27 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> but rather it was recovered by the police with the use of the canines (see pp 436, 440: Rekod Rayuan Jld 2).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Apart from the above, there was the issue of access to the car by others. The 1st appellant had rented a room from Azhar bin Abdul Razak. SD3, the real estate agent confirmed that the said unit of the condominium was rented out to Azhar. SD6, from Mun Hin Motor Sdn Bhd confirmed that he sold the Mercedes to Hakimi bin Saad. He further said that (p 613: Rekod Rayuan Jld 2) "Pembeli kereta itu ialah satu lelaki dan satu perempuan, ada empat orang datang, semuanya dua lagi lelaki.". When asked whether the two appellants were ever with Hakimi to view the car, SP6 answered in the negative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The investigating officer (SP15) did not investigate and did not know who or how many people had access to the Mercedes prior to the 1st appellant being seen driving the car on 4 June 2010 at about 7.30pm (see p 451:RR Jld 2). Nevertheless it cannot be denied that both Hakimi and Azhar had access to the Mercedes. Hakimi could not be called to testify. He died on 31 May 2010. Efforts were made by the defence to call Azhar as a witness, but Azhar could not be traced. SP15 admitted that there were no personal belongings of both the appellants in the Mercedes Benz which supports the evidence of the 1st appellant that he was in the car momentarily.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> We were mindful of the fact that besides the name of Hakimi bin Saad as the insured for the use of the Mercedes, the name of Ahmad Azhari bin Ahmad Zaini (with no other particulars, for example the identity card number) appears on the Confirmation of Purchase of Insurance as the other named driver. However in our view, the name <i>per se</i> is not sufficient to prove that the 1st appellant had possession of the drugs found in the Mercedes.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Viewed in the light of the following facts, namely that the appellants were not the owner of the Mercedes; that there was no evidence for how long the 1st appellant had been driving the Mercedes; that no evidence was adduced as to who had access to the Mercedes prior to the arrest of the appellants; that there was no physical contact between both the appellants and the two bags containing the cannabis in the boot of the Mercedes (given the evidence of SP4 that the police team had raided the appellants before they could lift the bags); and in the light of the defence, we were of the view that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The learned trial judge had found that the appellants had actual possession of the drugs and had invoked <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;37.;;">s 37(da) of the Act</LINK> to find trafficking against the appellants. Having heard the defence, the learned trial judge however had failed to make a ruling on whether the appellants had rebutted the presumption of trafficking. This is yet another misdirection warranting appellate intervention (see <i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. Public Prosecutor (supra)</i>; <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_3_487;"><i>Victor Chidiebere Nzomiwu &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [2013] 3 MLRA 487</LINK>; [2013] 2 MLJ 690).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In light of all the above, we were of the view that the convictions of the appellants were not safe. We therefore unanimously allowed the appeals of both the appellants and dismissed the appeal of the prosecution. The appellants were acquitted and discharged.</p>
