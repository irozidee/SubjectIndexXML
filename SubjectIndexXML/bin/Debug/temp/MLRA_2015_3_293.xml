    <p>The defendant was the main contractor for a project to upgrade a polytechnic. By two separate subcontracts, the defendant engaged the plaintiff to carry out: (i) a subcontract for earthworks ("earthworks subcontract") for RM15,755; and (ii) a subcontract for the permanent and temporary site office ("site office subcontract") for RM185,000. The plaintiff sued the defendant and claimed <i>inter alia</i>: (a) in respect of the earthworks subcontract a sum of RM270,625.13 as value of earthworks done but not paid; and (b) in respect of the site office subcontract a sum of RM89,811.09 as value of works done but not paid. The defendant on the other hand counterclaimed: (1) in respect of the earthworks subcontract, RM666,820 for completing the plaintiff's works and clearing the debris allegedly dumped by the plaintiff onto neighbouring land; and (2) in respect of the site office subcontract, RM10,000 for clearing works done by a third party. The High Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim but allowed the defendant's counterclaim against the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The High Court judge erred when he totally dismissed the plaintiff's claim and allowed the defendant's counterclaim of RM10,000 in respect of the site office subcontract. The High Court judge had misapprehended the pleadings and the evidence adduced, failed to appreciate and consider the evidence and had made an erroneous decision which was inconsistent with the contemporaneous, unchallenged documentary evidence and which also had contradicted the defendant's own admission or concession. (paras 17-18)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Appellate intervention was required and this court would set aside the order of the High Court in respect of the site office subcontract and substitute it with the order that the defendant pay the plaintiff the sum of RM87,502.07 after taking into account the counterclaim of RM10,000. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The plaintiff's claim under the earthworks subcontract ought to be allowed. The defendant ought to pay the plaintiff the sum of RM258,585.20 as being the unpaid balance value of earthworks executed by the plaintiff under the earthworks subcontract. The High Court judge had clearly erred when he dismissed the plaintiff's claim under the earthworks subcontract. (paras 28-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The High Court judge had failed to appreciate the facts as alluded to by the plaintiff and in failing to do so, he had misdirected himself to such an extent as to find that the defendant's counterclaim was valid and to have allowed it. (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The High Court judge further misdirected himself when he allowed the defendant's counterclaim by awarding the gross amount of costs of getting another subcontractor to execute the so-called balance works as the alleged loss or damage whereas it should have been calculated differently. (para 35)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Since the plaintiff had completed the earthworks under the earthworks subcontract and the so-called balance works allegedly not done by the plaintiff were different from that complained by the defendant in terms of type, description, location and quantity, there could be no counterclaim under this head by the defendant against the plaintiff. (para 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> There was overwhelming evidence which pointed to the fact that the plaintiff could not have transported all the earth out of the polytechnic site and dumped it on the adjoining land. The High Court judge had failed to fully appreciate the evidence tendered in court. (para 42)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Umi Kalthum Abdul Majid JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant is appealing against the whole decision of the learned High Court Judge dated 16 January 2013 after full trial. The learned High Court Judge had dismissed the appellant's claim against the respondent and had allowed the respondent's counterclaim against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> For ease of reference we will refer the parties as in the High Court suit wherein the appellant was the plaintiff and the respondent was the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The undisputed facts are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Before Us</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Site Office Subcontract</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As the issues, facts and evidence in respect of the Site Office Subcontract are simpler and shorter, the plaintiff had submitted on it first. We agree with this approach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It was submitted by the plaintiff that the learned High Court Judge did not make any specific finding of fact in regard to the Site Office Subcontract other than to state at para 34.2 of his Grounds of Judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There was no reason given for this decision and no analysis or discussion of evidence was done by the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Witnesses for both parties had confirmed that the original scope of works for the Site Office Subcontract was RM185,000.00 and that this original scope was completed by the plaintiff. The items of works in dispute are in regard to the variation works. The parties respective amounts for the variation works are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In respect of variation Items 1, 3 and 4 above, the plaintiff adopted the figures as admitted by the defendant in its amended statement of defence, para 19 and DWI's witness statement Q&amp;A 19.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Item 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> As for variation Item 2, change of terrazzo floor tiles to Porcelain Granite Tiles, it was submitted that JKR in its Final Account on the Project (P74) had certified and paid RM110,500.00 (see pp 442-448, especially page 445, ACOB) to the defendant for this variation executed by the plaintiff on its behalf. Yet the defendant had acted oppressively and/or unreasonably by grossly undervaluing the plaintiff's value for this variation work at a mere RM16,891.18 of what the defendant had received from the Government/JKR for this variation work. It was the plaintiff's contention that the learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the material evidence in the Final Account in P74. P74 was a contemporary document issued by an independent party and which was unchallenged by the defendant. It was prepared by the Government/JKR and signed and agreed to by the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Item 5</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> As for variation Item 5, additional electrical and external water supply works, the plaintiff had proposed an amount of RM13,405.00 for this variation work by letter dated 30 April 2002 (exh P4, p 301, ACOB). As there was no contemporaneous document from the defendant to deny this item or its amount, neither did the defendant dispute this amount, it was contended by the plaintiff that the defendant had accepted the said item and amount, especially seeing that the defendant did not give evidence as to the reasonable amount for this variation at trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Item 6</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> As for variation Item 6, upgrading of architecture finishes, it was contended by the plaintiff that contemporaneous documents P25 (pp 313-314 ACOB) and P23 (pp 315-320 ACOB) showed that there was variation to the architecture finishes, re-upgrading of architecture finishes. The plaintiff's claimed variation amount of RM4,518.66 which was accepted by conduct of the defendant. At the trial, the plaintiff had testified to this amount of variation, but the defendant did not give evidence as to the reasonable amount for this variation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Therefore, it was submitted by the plaintiff that evidence showed that on the balance of probabilities the plaintiff had been successful in proving the variation amounts as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Since it was not disputed that the total amount of monies paid by the defendant to the plaintiff in respect of the Site Office Subcontract was RM168,000.00, it was submitted by the plaintiff that the unpaid balance value of works executed by the plaintiff is calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The defendant purported to set-off two items in respect of the Site Office Subcontract. They were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(See DW1's witness statement, Q&amp;A 17, p 116, ACOB)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It was submitted that, in respect of Item a, for alleged cost of building materials paid on behalf of the plaintiff, as it was not pleaded by the defendant, no documentary evidence of the alleged cost of building materials was adduced by the defendant, no evidence as to what types of materials and how much materials, and when the alleged payment made, it was non-recoverable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> As for item (b), for alleged cleaning works, DW1 in Q&amp;A 16 of his witness statement (p 116, ACOB) stated that Global Season was employed by the defendant for the cleaning up work at the site office. It was submitted that there was no evidence to prove what and why was the cleaning-up was required. There was no evidence to prove that the alleged cleaning-up was within the plaintiff's scope of subcontract works and therefore on the balance of probabilities this item should not be allowed to be set off. During submission before us, however, learned counsel for the plaintiff was prepared to concede this item in favour of the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> That being the case, it was submitted by the plaintiff that the nett balance unpaid amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant in respect of the Site Office Subcontract is RM97,502.07 - RM10,000.00 = RM87,502.07.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We have carefully read the parties' submission and perused, the documentary evidence, the grounds of judgment of the learned High Court Judge, the relevant witness statements and pleadings of the parties. We have set out in detail the submissions of the plaintiff under this head of claim in respect of the Site Office Subcontract in order to show the legal reasoning of the plaintiff as well as our agreement with its legal reasoning. We can do no better than that as submitted by the plaintiff, as we agree that the learned High Court Judge had clearly erred when he totally dismissed the plaintiff's claim and allowed the defendant's counterclaim of RM10,000.00 in respect of the Site Office Subcontract. We find that the learned High Court Judge had misapprehended the pleadings and the evidence adduced, had failed to appreciate and consider the evidence and had made an erroneous decision which was inconsistent with the contemporaneous, unchallenged documentary evidence and which also had contradicted the defendant's own admission/concession.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Other than matters already alluded to before this, which showed the error of the learned High Court Judge in appreciating the evidence adduced by the parties, we take note that the learned High Court Judge had also clearly erred when he dismissed the plaintiff's claim in respect of the site office and allowed the defendant's counterclaim of RM10,000.00 in respect of the same when DWI, Dato' How Pooi Gen (who was the Project Director of the defendant) himself had in his witness statement (Q&amp;A17, p 116 ACOB) explained his version of final account for the Site Office Subcontract as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In Q&amp;A18 of his witness statement (p 117, ACOB) DWI admitted that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We therefore are of the view that this is a case where appellate intervention is required and we do so. We therefore set aside the Order of the High Court in respect of the Site Office Subcontract and substitute it with the Order that the defendant is required to pay the plaintiff the sum of RM87,502.07 after taking into account the counterclaim of RM10,000.00 (which is maintained).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Earthworks Subcontract</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In the Earthworks Subcontract, the original subcontract sum was RM15,755.00 (see cl 1.1, Earthworks Subcontract, p 253, ACOB).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The description of the earthworks is as summarised in Item 1, Appendix 1 of the Subcontract (p 257, ACOB) as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was the plaintiff's contention that what the description meant was for the earthworks to involve the cutting and filling works to be executed within the site and did not cover transporting of earth out of the site. It was testified by PW5, Johnson Lee (who is the Managing Director of the plaintiff) (at p 103, ACOB), that the cut and fill of earth under the Earthworks Subcontract was evenly balanced and the plaintiff did not have any surplus earth to be transported out of the Port Dickson Polytechnic site.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The transporting of excess earth out of the site to contractor's own dump was a separate and different item of works in the defendant's main contract with the Government/JKR but was not included in the plaintiff's scope of Earthworks Subcontract. This could be seen in the Final Account between the Government/JKR and the defendant, exh P73 ("the Final Account") at p 440, ACOB, item B where it was stated "Excavate and transport surplus excavated materials off the site to Contractor's own dump". Whereas the plaintiff's subcontract earthworks description was reflected in Item C, at p 439, ACOB, of the Final Account. That being the case, it was the plaintiff's contention that Item C of the Final Account had certified the total final quantity of cut and fill earthworks by the plaintiff as 169,214 cubic meters. Moreover, the Government's Consultant Quantity Surveyor PW7, Aziz Mohamed, had testified, in respect of this total and final quantity of cut and fill earthworks, that as far he knew, the plaintiff was the only subcontractor who executed this item (p 185, ACOB).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It was common ground that both parties had subsequently agreed to the revised rates of earthworks as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Based on the agreed revised rates and total quantity of 169,214 cubic meters, it was contended by the plaintiff that the total value of the plaintiff's earthworks under the Earthwork Subcontract was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> As the defendant had paid the plaintiff in respect of the Earthworks Subcontract the total sum of RM61,000.00, the unpaid balance value of earthworks executed by the plaintiff is calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> With regard to the defendant's version that the total quantity of earthworks executed by the plaintiff was only 65,075 cubic meters, it was submitted by the plaintiff that the defendant's version was contrary to the Final Account (P73) which contained the Government/JKR's certification and the defendant's admission of the total final quantity of cut and fill earthworks at 169,214 cubic meters, which was confirmed by PW7. The defendant had relied on JKR's interim valuation as at 30 July 2002 of 65,075 cubic meters. It was the plaintiff's submission that this reliance was erroneous. PW7 had testified that his interim valuation was a temporary quantity by brief check during monthly site visit, at interim stages where he did not know about the variations instructed and the additional/variation quantities would only be fully captured in the final account measurement (p 199, lines 34-37; p 200 lines 1-37, ACOB)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Having perused the relevant documents/exhibits, testimonies of the relevant witnesses and submissions of the parties, we once again have to agree with the submissions of the plaintiff in respect of the Earthworks Subcontract. The learned High Court Judge had failed to appreciate and consider the evidence adduced, in particular exh P73, the Final Account. For if he had done so he would have clearly seen that the earthworks executed by the plaintiff (as there were no other subcontractor doing this earthworks according to PW5 and PW7) under Item C of the Final Account was 169,214 cubic meters and not, as contended by the defendant, 65,075 cubic meters. We generally accept the submission of the plaintiff. Accordingly we allow the plaintiff's claim under this head of claim and set aside the Order of the learned High Court Judge to that extent. We hold that the defendant is required to pay the plaintiff the sum of RM258,585.20 as being the unpaid balance value of earthworks executed by the plaintiff under the Earthworks Subcontract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> We further note that the learned High Court Judge had clearly erred when he dismissed the plaintiff's claim under this head of claim. This is because even if the defendant's version had been accepted by us (which we do not), that the plaintiff had only executed for 65,075 cubic meters of earthworks, this would mean that the total value of earthworks for 65,075 cubic meters was RM132,135.00 calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As the amount paid by the defendant to the plaintiff for the earthworks was RM61,000.00 there would still remain an unpaid balance value of earthworks executed by the plaintiff in the sum of RM71,135.00 calculated as follows"</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Defendant's Counterclaims</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alleged Outstanding Earthworks Within The Plaintiff's Scope Of Works</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The defendant alleged that there was 104,139 cubic meters of outstanding balance earthworks left undone by the plaintiff. It was the plaintiff's position that this allegation was contradictory to the defendant's letter dated 11 September 2002 (D38, pp 290-291, ACOB) read together with plaintiff's letter dated 10 September 2002 (P20, pp 285-288, ACOB) where it showed the defendant's complaint was in respect of three items of earthwork left not done namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> It was the plaintiff's contention that these three items of balance earthworks was nowhere comparable to the defendant's version that 104,139 cubic meters of balance earthworks were left undone by the plaintiff. In any case, it was the plaintiff's stance that these "minor" balance items were executed by the plaintiff and that there was no outstanding earthworks within the plaintiff's scope of works. The plaintiff's witnesses, [PW1's (Yap Wei Ling) witness statement, Q&amp;A4, p 76, ACOB; PW4's (Pan Keat Leong) witness statement, Q&amp;A5, p 78, ACOB] had testified that the earthworks platforms were completed but that the defendant kept changing the platform levels from time to time. This evidence remained unrebutted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Moreover, it was the plaintiff's contention that the details of the items awarded to another subcontractor, known as Rantau Seraya Sdn Bhd ("Rantau Seraya") to allegedly execute outstanding balance earthworks of the plaintiffs were different in type and description of works from those complained of by the defendant in September 2002; the earthworks were at different locations from those complained by the defendant in September 2002; the alleged items of works awarded to Rantau Seraya were executed between March 2003 and July 2003, many months after the plaintiff had left the site (and yet there was not a single letter of complaint from the Government/JKR regarding the alleged outstanding items); the quantities of the items allegedly outstanding balance work complained by the defendant in September 2002 could not possibly account for the huge difference between the Government/JKR's certified final quantity of earthworks in the Final Account of 169,214 cubic meters and the defendant's version of 65,075 cubic meters allegedly being the total quantity of earthworks executed by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Further, it was submitted that under the Earthworks Subcontract, cl 8 (Standard Terms and Conditions, Appendix II, p 260, ACOB), all variations must be in writing before the plaintiff had the obligation to execute it. In the present suit, there was no written instruction by the defendant to order the plaintiff to execute the items of works described in pp 365 and 366, ACOB. As such, there was no obligation on the plaintiff's part to execute these variations beyond the original contract quantity. Therefore the plaintiff was not in breach of any obligation in respect of these items, and the defendant was not entitled to recover any loss or damage arising therefrom. The plaintiff cited Chow Kok Fong, <i>Law and Practice of Construction Contracts </i>(3rd edn, 2004, pp 178-186) as its authority for this proposition. In any event, where the work is outside the scope of the subcontract, the subcontractor is entitled to refuse to carry it out despite instructions from the employer/main contractor. The plaintiff cited <i>Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts</i>, 11th edn, vol 1, pp 929-939, as its authority on this proposition.</p>

      <b>[34]</b> Following on our finding that, based in particular on exh P73, the Final Account, the plaintiff had executed the earthworks under Item C of the same to the amount of 169,214 cubic meters in respect of the Earthworks Subcontract, this must necessarily mean that the plaintiff had completely executed the earthworks as per the Earthworks Subcontract. We also agree with the plaintiff's submission that cl 8 of the Earthworks Subcontract requires any variation ordered must be in writing and since there was no written instructions by the defendant to order the plaintiff to execute the items of works described in pp 365 to 366, ACOB, there was no obligation on the plaintiff's part to execute the variations beyond the subcontract based on the authorities cited. It appear to us that the learned High Court Judge had failed to appreciate the facts as alluded to by the plaintiff and in failing to do so he had misdirected himself to such an extent as to find that the defendant's counterclaim was valid and had allowed it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The learned High Court Judge had further misdirected himself when he allowed the defendant's counterclaim by awarding the gross amount of costs of getting another subcontractor (Rantau Seraya) to execute the so-called balance works as the alleged loss or damage whereas it should have been calculated as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> In the premises, we agree with the submission of the plaintiff that as the plaintiff had completed the earthworks under the Earthworks Subcontract, and that the so-called balance works allegedly not done by the plaintiff were different from that complained by the defendant in terms of type, description, location and quantity, there can be no counterclaim under this head by the defendant against the plaintiff. We, therefore, set aside the learned High Court Judge's order under this item for the amount of RM295,840.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Alleged Removal Of Construction Debris And Works And/Or Earth</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Another counterclaim item by the defendant against the plaintiff was in respect of the alleged removal of construction debris and wastes and/or earth from neighboring owner Matrix Concept's land which the defendant alleged was dumped by the plaintiff onto Matrix Concept's land. The defendant alleged that it had to engage Rantau Seraya to remove 41,220 cubic meters of earth at an alleged total gross costs of RM370,980.00 and the defendant had counterclaimed this amount against the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> It was the plaintiff's case that, vide its witness testimony PW5 (Q&amp;A 33 p 103, ACOB), the cut and fill earthworks under the plaintiff's Earthworks Subcontract was an evenly balanced cut and fill earthworks without any excess or surplus earth to be transported out of the site. This fact was corroborated by the following documentary evidence:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> In any case, vide the defendant's letter dated 17 July 2003, to the plaintiff (exh D5, p 342, ACOB), 3rd paragraph, the defendant complained that "... earth dumping at the back ... encroach inside other people land by five meter or more". The defendant instructed the plaintiff "... to cut down the earth level on the left hand site and dozed it toward the right hand site, which is Polytheniktecnic [<i>sic</i>] land." In contrast, the alleged excess earth which the defendant purportedly employed Rantau Seraya to remove from Matrix Concept's land involved an encroachment of 65 meters (see D78, pp 367- 368, ACOB). Also in contrast was Matrix Concept's letter of complaint dated 6 August 2003 (see pp 372-374, ACOB) with regard to the presence of construction debris and waste over an area covering six rows of housing plots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> It was submitted seeing that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>the Matrix Concept's complaint of construction debris and wastes covering six rows of housing plots could not be the excess earth dumped by the plaintiff, that is, that the 65 meters of encroachment could not be caused by the plaintiff and the said photographs showed that the construction debris and wastes at Matrix Concept's land were dumped by other subcontractors after the plaintiff left the site.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Further, it was submitted that if the plaintiff had dumped such huge quantities of earth, debris and wastes over an extensive area on Matrix Concept's land in or before July 2002, it was highly improbable for the defendant to overlook it and not send more letters of complaint to the plaintiff, especially seeing that a letter of complaint was sent to the plaintiff by the defendant on the 5 meters of encroachment in July 2002. In the circumstances, it was submitted that there were overwhelming evidence in the contemporaneous documents which point to the fact that the plaintiff did not transport the alleged 41,220 cubic meters of earth out of the Polytechnic site to dump them on Matrix Concept land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> After perusing carefully all the contemporaneous documentary evidence tendered in court and the testimonies of witnesses, we once again agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that there are overwhelming evidence which point to the fact that the plaintiff could not have transported 41,220 cubic meters of earth out of the Polytechnic site and dump them on Matrix Concept land. We find once again that the learned High Court Judge had failed to fully appreciate the evidence tendered in court. Since the findings of facts by the learned judge were based on the same documentary evidence as alluded to by the plaintiff before us, we find that there is no danger of us making findings of facts which differed from the learned High Court Judge. For the reasons stated by the plaintiff, we agree that the learned High Court Judge was wrong to have allowed the defendant's counterclaim under this head of claim for RM370,980.00. We therefore set aside the learned High Court Judge's order under this item for the amount of RM370,980.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As in the case of the alleged outstanding earthworks referred to in paras 30-36 above, and if we agree with the learned High Court Judge (which we do not) that the defendant is entitled to his counterclaim, we also find that the learned High Court Judge had erred in awarding the defendant the gross amount of the alleged removal of excess earth from Matrix Concept's land. The learned High Court Judge ought to have proceeded to find and assess the value of the plaintiff's works on the excavation and transporting out the excess earth of 41,220 cubic meters and to award it to the plaintiff as value of such works done, and then set-off against the defendant's contract rate with the Government/JKR for earth excavation and transporting out of the site at RM9.00 per cubic meter being the alleged total gross value of removal works said to be executed by Rantau Seraya. This was not done by the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> For the reasons stated above, we unanimously allow the plaintiff's appeal with costs of RM60,000.00 here and below. We set aside the High Court Order dated 16 January 2013 and in substitution we make the following order:</p>
