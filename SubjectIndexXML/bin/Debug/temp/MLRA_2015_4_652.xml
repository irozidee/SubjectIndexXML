    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The High Court had set aside and dissolved <i>ex parte</i> orders for an interim injunction and ordered damages occasioned thereby be assessed by the Senior Assistant Registrar ('SAR') and paid by the respondents to the appellant, due to the closure of the factory in which the appellant was one of the shareholders. Consequently, the respondents appealed against the assessment by the SAR to the Judge in Chambers ('JIC') who allowed the appeal. This was the appellant's appeal against the decision of the JIC. In this appeal, the appellants contended, amongst others, that the JIC had erred in holding that there was no causal link between the alleged loss and damage and the injunction order; and that the basis for the reasoning of the JIC's decision was flawed. On the other hand, a preliminary objection was raised by the respondents after the appellant completed his submissions, on the basis that the first supplementary Record of Appeal was filed out of time and the second supplementary Record of Appeal was served just before this appeal, both without leave of the court. Following that, the respondents also contended that the Court of Appeal should be disinclined to reverse the finding of the trial judge on damages as it was an exercise of judicial discretion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Counsel for the respondents in this case chose to sit and hear out the submissions for the appellant before standing up to object. The submissions for the appellant were made on the basis of the appeal records as rectified by the supplementary Records of Appeal which although filed without leave of the court was not objected to by counsel for the respondents. Since the objection was a mere technical non-compliance, and raising the objection, not before, but after submissions for the appeal was completed suggested that the objection was not made <i>bona fide</i> to avoid a substantial miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the preliminary objection was dismissed and the supplementary Records of Appeal were accepted. (paras 10, 14 &amp; 15)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The fact that the factory closed down prior to the date when the injunction was granted did not mean the injunction did not cause any loss. A loss was incurred not only when a business was prevented from continuing its business, but also when it was prevented from reopening. In short, the respondents' submissions failed to demonstrate that the losses claimed did not result from the injunction and thus, the JIC erred on the causal link. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> When the order was made for assessment before the SAR, the latter was formally invested with jurisdiction to make that assessment. It behoved the parties to place evidence before the SAR to enable the latter to make the assessment according to law. If any party failed to place that evidence it was too late to scamper to the JIC for a second bite at the cherry on the grounds that the appeal was a rehearing. Therefore, the basis of reasoning upon which the decision of the JIC was made was flawed. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> In the instant case, the exercise of judicial discretion by the SAR was made by an order of the High Court. Hence, there was no merit in the submission by the respondents that the Court of Appeal was disinclined to reverse the finding of the trial judge on damages as it was an exercise of judicial discretion. It was a contradiction that the judge of the court may with flawed reasoning interfere with the findings and decision of the SAR as authorised and directed by an order of the High Court, but the Court of Appeal must be disinclined to intervene with the decision of the JIC. (paras 26 &amp; 29)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The 2nd defendant, Yu Gui ("the appellant") appealed against the decision made on 4 January 2013 by the Judge in Chambers to allow an appeal from the assessment by the Senior Assistant Registrar on 20 September 2012.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 20 August 2009, the High Court had set aside and dissolved <i>ex parte</i> orders for interim injunction granted on 29 June 2009 and ordered damages occasioned thereby be assessed by the Deputy Registrar and paid by Jeffery Law Siew Su, Ng Siew Hong and Mastika Jaya Timber Sdn Bhd, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs and the 1st, 2nd and the 3rd respondents respectively ("the respondents"), to the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondents had obtained on 29 June 2009 by an <i>ex parte</i> application against Jin Chenji, Yu Gui, Lee Chien-Jung, Rich Efficient Wood Industries Sdn Bhd, PDZ Shipping Agency (Kuching) Sdn Bhd, as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants (collectively "the defendants"), interim injunctions which provided for:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The company was the 4th defendant, in which the 1st, 2nd (the appellant herein) and 3rd defendant were shareholders. The 5th defendant was the shipping transporter. The company was set up in 2009 and was involved in the business of production and sale of veneer. It rented premises with 13 factory machineries under a Tenancy Agreement dated 3 March 2009. Dispute arose over the sale of two containers of goods.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminary Objection After Appellant's Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> After counsel for the appellant completed his submissions, counsel for the respondents stood up to submit. He raised preliminary objections that the First Supplementary Record of Appeal was filed out of time and the Second Supplementary Record of Appeal was served in October just before the appeal, both without leave of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> A written summary of the respondents' preliminary objections, and a section on preliminary objections had been included in the written submissions dated 6 August 2013, had been filed before the hearing of the appeal. The grounds were that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The Supplementary Records of Appeal corrected the defects summarised at para [6] a above. The objection was therefore essentially that the two supplementary Records of Appeal were filed without the leave of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Thus, but for the absence of leave of the court for the supplementary Records of Appeal, the Records of Appeal were complete for the appeal to be heard on the merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> If objections were made for the failure to obtain leave, the parties would be heard thereon before a decision is made to sustain it or not. What needs to be borne in mind is the principle upon which an application to file out of time is made. Even though it is mandatory to obtain leave, leave would be granted if such leave would enable the appeal to be heard on its merits without imposing injustice to the respondent. It is hard to conceive in an instance when such leave would impose an injustice upon the respondent since the respondent could be granted time to address it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> But in this case counsel chose to sit, hear out the submissions for the appellant and only after submissions for the appellant was completed did counsel stand up to object. The submissions for the appellant were made on the basis of the appeal records as rectified by the Supplementary Records of Appeal which although filed without leave of the court was not objected to by counsel for the respondents.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> These orders underlie the basic philosophy for the interpretation and the application of the rules, not to be interpreted and applied as handicaps for technical knockouts without due regard for the interests of justice. The supplementary records in this case completed the records to enable the appeal to be heard on its merits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Since the objection was a mere technical non-compliance, and raising the objection not before but after submissions for the appeal was completed suggests that the objection was not made <i>bona fide</i> in good faith to avoid a substantial miscarriage of justice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Accordingly, we accepted the Supplementary Records of Appeal, dismissed the preliminary objection, and directed counsel for the respondents to proceed with the appeal and for which he had filed his written submissions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The appellant had submitted a brief note of submissions on 27 August 2013. It centred on ground 3 of the Memorandum of Appeal. It is best appreciated by reference to the Notes of Proceedings of the learned Judge in Chambers dated 4 January 2013 filed by supplementary Record of Appeal on 16 May 2013:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the first paragraph, the learned judge was correct to hold that it does not lie in the mouth of counsel for the plaintiffs (the respondents herein) to object to the admissibility of documentary exhibits that had been admitted without objections by the plaintiffs. The learned judge was also correct that the issue was whether the documentary exhibits were proof of monetary contribution towards the setting up of the company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We note that the documentary exhibits for expenses claimed by the appellant as defendant herein pertained to rental payment, purchase of machinery, employment of workers from China, payment of workers' remuneration, petty cash and renovation. It is not obviously incredible that these were for the setting up of the factory so that it is not necessary for the respondents to answer it with evidence showing they were not for the factory. That the expenditures were substantial, running into the hundreds of thousands is not a reason to require the appellant herein to prove that he actually dug into his own pockets to fork out the "alleged money for the setting up of the 4th defendant", for when the respondents herein as plaintiffs did not object to the documentary evidence of those expenditures for that purpose, it was not "alleged" but became evidence admitted into evidence without objection. Where the defendant as claimant had placed some evidence that reasonably goes towards proving his claim, but without any evidence adduced by the respondents as plaintiff responding to the defendant's claim for compensation for losses incurred by an <i>ex parte</i> injunction obtained by the plaintiffs, the scale of justice on proof upon a balance of probabilities surely tilts in favour of the appellant as the defendant making the claim. The reality of proof upon a balance of probabilities is that if a defendant does not produce evidence but merely denies or claims the proof is not good enough for him, he has placed nothing on the scales of justice better known as the balance of probabilities; and if both parties have placed proof upon the balance of probabilities, then only the relative weights given to each piece of evidence affect in which direction the balance will tilt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We note also that the defendant was the person who submitted the evidence of those payments made for the company. It does not matter where he obtained the money from, but in law he is responsible to pay to other persons if he borrowed money from them. He is entitled to seek to recover it from the respondents if their <i>ex parte</i> injunction is the cause of that money being lost. And even if those persons paid to him money that was his, then it was his money that he had spent, and if by the injunction he had lost it, then he is equally entitled to recover it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> As to the finding by the learned judge that the injunction order was only granted on 29 June 2009, while DW2 testified the factory was closed down on 15 June 2009 because the plaintiffs sealed the factory. Without evidence of DW2 there was no evidence adduced to enable a finding when the factory was in fact sealed. Though the order of the court was made on 29 June 2009, it is not impossible there was some kind of sealing attempt before the court order was made. It is equally not impossible for DW2 to have erred on the actual date of sealing or closure. But a fact that the factory was closed down on 15 June 2009 and an injunction was obtained only on 29 June 2009 means that the factory could not be opened by the appellant and the respondents when they choose to do so. These were not considered. The learned Judge in Chambers has erred therefore on the causal link. The documentary evidence showed expenditures that are not disputed as incredible to be accepted as expenditures incurred for the factory. The standard of proof upon a balance of probabilities does not require that because it is a large amount, the proof must be weightier. Where the appellant got the money from is basically irrelevant, for if borrowed or obtained from another, he ultimately is responsible to pay it back. That the factory has closed down when the injunction was granted does not mean the injunction did not cause any loss. That the injunction prevented reopening when the appellant needs to do so was not considered. A loss is incurred not only when a business is prevented from continuing its business, but also when it is prevented from reopening. And that the expenditures were incurred without the expectation that one day there would be an injunction is no answer when it is lost when an injunction is put in place. In short the submissions failed to demonstrate that the losses claimed did not result from the injunction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It is clear to our minds that the basis of reasoning upon which the decision was made to allow the appeal and set aside the decision of the learned Senior Assistant Registrar was flawed. When the order was made for the assessment before the Senior Assistant Registrar, the latter was formally invested with jurisdiction to make that assessment. It behoves the parties to place evidence before the Senior Assistant Registrar to enable the latter to make the assessment according to law. If any party fails to place that evidence it is too late to scamper to the Judge in Chambers for a second bite at the cherry on the grounds that the appeal is a rehearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> It must be borne in mind that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;56.;;">O 56 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> in respect of appeals from the Registrar of the High Court to the Judge in Chambers provide specifically as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The manner the appeal is conducted and heard differs from the appeals from subordinate courts to the High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;55.;;">O 55</LINK> where it is provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;55;SN2.;;">O 55 r 2</LINK> that all appeals to the High Court shall be by way of re-hearing and shall be brought by giving a notice of appeal within 14 days from the date of the decision appealed from.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We would add that provision that an appeal is a rehearing means it is a rehearing of what is placed in evidence before the trial court, and the High Court intervenes in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;29.;;">s 29 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> that "All civil appeals from a subordinate court shall be by way of re-hearing, and the High Court shall have the like powers and jurisdiction on the hearing of appeals as the Court of Appeal has on the hearing of appeals from the High Court", and the Rules of Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We have addressed the relevant powers of the Court of Appeal in civil appeals earlier above. The purpose of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;;">Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK> and the rules are to prevent the appellate jurisdiction to rehear from being diluted to the level of retrials as a matter of course, contrary to the rules and the Act. It is to ensure that the time of the trial forums, be it a trial court or Senior Assistant Registrar is not wasted by lawyers taking a lackadaisical approach, expecting to be able to fix things upon an appeal. The number of trial courts compared to the number of appellate courts clearly dismisses that expectation as unreasonable, particularly since the profession is expected to be a learned profession to assist the courts in delivering justice for the litigants expeditiously and economically, and for that reason is given protected status in the courts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> There were no grounds in the present appeal that call for reliance upon the principles set out in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_3_311;"><i>Goo Sing Kar v.

Lam Yat Kheong &amp; Anor</i> [2002] 4 MLRH 477</LINK> that the Court of Appeal is disinclined to reverse the finding of the trial judge on damages as it is an exercise of judicial discretion and such assessment is seldom disturbed unless there is clear error on the principles of law or that the amount is erroneous and without any basis and justification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In <i>Goo Sing Kar v. Dato' Lim Ah Chap &amp; Ors (supra)</i>, the High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal to the High Court, but awarded a lesser figure of RM17,847,041.60 after noting that there was an error in calculating the total sum ordered. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's further appeal on the grounds that the findings of the Deputy Registrar and the High Court were concurrent, the High Court had meticulously sifted through the evidence in a detailed judgment, and based his confirmation of the award of damages on sound principles of law, and the appellant had failed to demonstrate that there had been any serious error of principle on the part of judge of the High Court when he heard the appeal from the assessment of damages by the Deputy Registrar. Unlike this case where the Judge in Chambers allowed the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In <i>Voo Nyuk Fah @ Peter &amp; Anor v. Lam Yat Kheong &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, the defendant therein denied the claim substantially on the basis that the issues of breach of fiduciary duties and fraud did not arise as the 1st plaintiff and the defendants at all material times had already ended their business relationship in the 2nd plaintiff by way of transfer of their shares therein to the 1st plaintiff and that the business of timber hauling and the tractors of the 2nd plaintiff were transferred and sold respectively to the defendants as part of the arrangement in the restructuring of the 2nd plaintiff. Assessment was done by the High Court on evidence adduced at a trial. It merely demonstrates a meticulous appreciation of the whole of the evidence by the High Court and does not pertain to the approach of appellate jurisdiction on assessment by the Registrar upon an order by the trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In this case, the exercise of judicial discretion by the Senior Assistant Registrar was made by an order of the High Court to be exercised by the Senior Assistant Registrar. Therefore, we found no merit in the above submission by the respondents as it is a contradiction that the judge of the court may with flawed reasoning interfere with the findings and decision of the Senior Assistant Registrar as authorised and directed by an order of the High Court, but the Court of Appeal must be disinclined to intervene with that decision of the Judge in Chambers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Although counsel for the respondents had in his oral submissions summarised his submissions substantially, we had the benefit of his written submissions dated 6 August 2013 and the written summary of respondents' submission. We had taken consideration of the submissions in addressing the reasoning of the Judge in Chambers.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Accordingly, we allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the Judge in Chambers, reinstated the order of the Senior Assistant Registrar, fixed costs in the sum of RM15,000.00 and refunded the deposit paid.</p>
