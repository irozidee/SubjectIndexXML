    <p>The respondents, who were arrested in 2001 under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73(1) Internal Security Act 1960 ('ISA')</LINK> (since repealed) and detained further under s 8 ISA before they were released in 2003, brought an action against the appellants for unlawful detention and defamation. The defamation was in relation to a press statement made by the 1st appellant stating that the respondents' arrest and detention were due to their involvement in militant activities. In defence, the appellants claimed that the detention was in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">ss 73(1)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">8 ISA</LINK> and that they were entitled to the defence of qualified privilege, if the press statement was held to be defamatory. The learned judge found in favour of the respondents, awarding general damages for false imprisonment in the sum of RM15,000 each per day for each day detained, aggravated damages for false imprisonment in the sum of RM30,000 each, damages for defamation in the sum of RM100,000 (RM60,000 general damages and RM40,000 aggravated and exemplary damages) and costs of RM200,000. The appellants now appealed against the decision of the learned judge allowing the respondents' claim. The respondents appealed against the quantum of damages awarded for defamation claiming that the sum awarded was inadequate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appellants' appeal on defence of qualified privilege and allowing the appellants' appeal on quantum of damages for false imprisonment; dismissing the respondents' appeal on quantum of damages for defamation:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">Section 73 ISA</LINK> empowered a police officer to arrest and detain any person pending inquiries. However, the police officer must have reason to believe there were grounds justifying the detention of that person under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8 ISA</LINK>. The press statement was publication to all and sundry that the police had reason to believe that there were grounds justifying the respondents' detention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8 ISA</LINK> and they had acted or were about to act or were likely to act in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia. The press statement unquestionably associated the respondents with the activities of reform activists. It was <i>prima facie</i> defamatory if the association and accusation turned out not to be true. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The exercise of the draconian powers to arrest and detain pending inquiries under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8 ISA</LINK> should be explained to the public so as to reassure the public that the draconian powers were not being abused. It was only too easy and tempting to label political opponents as a security threat and thus justify their arrest and detention. The duty to explain to the public was an occasion of privilege, and statements made for general publication called for the protection of qualified privilege. However, if the occasion was abused, the defence was not available. (paras 28-29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The appellants' claim that that the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73 ISA</LINK> were merely followed and that there was prior investigation by the intelligence division ('Bahagian Risikan') did not sufficiently answer the challenge to the arrest and detention. The respondents were also not questioned or required to explain their activities purported to be prejudicial to the security of Malaysia. Further, the appellants' witnesses admitted that they did not find anything to link the respondents to the militant activities, and that the interrogations had nothing to do with national security. (paras 35-38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The fact that the information linking the respondents to militant activities was obtained by the Bahagian Risikan and was conveyed to the 1st appellant could not be relied upon by the 1st appellant as a defence to show lack of malice. The explanation provided by the press statement meant there was already some evidence before the respondents were arrested and detained under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73 ISA</LINK>. The admissions of the appellants' witnesses meant that the press statement was incorrect and not true when it gave the inference there was some evidence against the respondents of their activities prejudicial to the security of Malaysia. The press statement issued to assure the public that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73 ISA</LINK> was not being abused, were in the circumstances made recklessly by the 1st appellant. The protection of qualified privilege was thereby lost. (paras 39-47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The injury suffered by the respondents must be balanced against the interests of the State and the nation, and that included all of its citizens, for whose interests the respondents undoubtedly were happy to represent. If it were the respondents' purpose to act, take risks and make sacrifices if necessary for the people, then it would be odd that the people as citizens indirectly pay for the respondents' substantial damages for the defamation. In such circumstances, the sacrifices, where warranted, and the vindication of a judgment was more valuable than any purely monetary award. Therefore, there was no error to warrant appellate intervention in the exercise of discretion by the learned judge in the award as to damages for defamation. (paras 53-54)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> This was not a case of persons involved in criminal activities for personal gain, but persons in political activities whom the police stated as having reason to believe were involved in activities prejudicial to the security of Malaysia. There was no basis for the arrest and detention. The respondents were in fact arrested for their political activities, and that struck at the very heart of democracy. It was a much more serious assault on personal liberty. The Federal Constitution expected the police to have a fair, objective and independent approach in respect of political activities, the key to a functioning democratic system. It was only when the police was seen to be fair, objective and independent could it be effective in serving its function within the law. (para 65)</p>

      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>

    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The 1st to the 8th plaintiffs, Mohamad Ezam bin Mohd Nor, Chua Tian Chang, Hishamuddin bin Rais, Saari bin Sungib, Badaruddin bin Ismail, Badrulamin bin Bahron, Abdul Ghani bin Haroon and Gobalakrishnan a/l Nagappan commenced an action in the tort of false/unlawful arrest and detention, and the tort of defamation for a claim for general, aggravated and exemplary damages against the appellants. At the trial before the High Court, the 1st, 7th and 8th plaintiffs discontinued their action. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th plaintiffs remained. They are hereinafter referred to collectively as "the plaintiffs".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The defences relied upon by the 1st, 2nd and the 3rd defendants Tan Sri Norian Mai, Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri and Kerajaan Malaysia (collectively "the defendants") were:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> At the end of the trial, the High Court entered judgment for the plaintiffs and awarded:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The defendants appealed against the decision of the High Court made on 2 October 2012 allowing the claim by the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th plaintiffs with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The plaintiffs appealed against the award of damages for defamation as inadequate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> For convenience, we refer to the appellants and the respondents as "the defendants" and "the plaintiffs" respectively.</p>
    <p>

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 2nd, 3rd and 4th plaintiffs were arrested on 10 April 2001 under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73(1) of the ISA</LINK>. The very next day, on 11 April 2001, a press conference was held, where a press statement ("the press statement") was issued to the press, asserting that their arrest and detention were related to militant activities. The arrests were reported in the newspapers on 12 April 2001.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The news was carried on the NST, Berita Harian, Utusan Malaysia and Harian Metro on 12 April 2001, and reported that several other related arrests were forthcoming.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The 5th and 6th plaintiffs were arrested and detained on 26 April 2001 and 20 April 2001 under the same section of the ISA. Their arrests were reported in the Malay Mail of 20 April 2001, Berita Harian of 21 April 2001 and the NST referred to the earlier arrests on 10 April 2001.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Pursuant to the powers under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8 of the ISA</LINK>, the Minister issued a detention order against the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The 2nd, 3rd and 4th; the 5th and the 6th plaintiffs were released on the 1 June 2003, 5 June 2003 and 12 June 2003 respectively.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Press Statement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We examined the press statement issued by the 1st defendant. We had added our translation thereto:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Observations On The Press Statement</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> With the exception of para 1 which announced the arrest and detention, the 1st sentence of para 2 and 2nd sentence of para 7, the bulk of the press statement described activities of reform activists that constituted acting in a manner prejudicial to "national security", a term that in the context of Malaysia falls within the meaning of the term used in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;;">ISA</LINK>, "security of Malaysia".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Paragraph 1 of the press statement, and similarly the arrests of the 5th and 6th plaintiffs clearly identified the plaintiffs. The first sentence of para 2 explained they were arrested and detained because there was information of their involvement in activities prejudicial to national security and the police need to conduct thorough investigations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">Section 73 of the ISA</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> If it is true there was such information, then only would the arrest and detention pending inquiries be authorised under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73(1)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The press statement then went on to describe the activities of reform activists that began in September 1998 that constituted "acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia", the actions taken successfully to contain them, the re-emergence of such activities in mid-1999, and the activities of the reform activists. Paragraph 7 began with concluding it was clear that reform activists were willing to act unconstitutionally and unlawfully to achieve their objectives. Then para 7 of the press statement concluded with the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The last sentence above faithfully reflected the language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73(1)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> While <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73</LINK> empowers a police officer to arrest and detain any person pending inquiries, there is a requirement that the police officer must have reason to believe there are grounds which would justify detention of that person under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8</LINK> and that the person had acted or was about to act or was likely to act in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia. Read as a whole, the requirement that the police officer must have reason to believe means <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73(1)</LINK> does not authorise the arrest and detention of anyone "pending further inquiries" in order to make out a case against the person, but to verify the grounds upon which the police had reason to believe, the grounds which would justify the plaintiffs' detention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8</LINK>, and that the person arrested and detained had acted or are about to act or are likely to act in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia or any part thereof or to the maintenance of essential services therein or to the economic life thereof.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The press statement of the arrest and detention at a press conference therefore meant publication to all and sundry that the police had reason to believe that there were grounds which would justify the plaintiffs' detention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8</LINK> and that they had acted or was about to act or was likely to act in any manner "prejudicial to the security of Malaysia ...". Although the last sentence of the press statement faithfully reflected the language of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73(1)</LINK>, it was not mere formality but was a specific statement that the defendants had reason to believe. The press statement unquestionably associated the plaintiffs with the activities of reform activists. It is the wrong kind of person, citizen or politician who regards involvement or accusation of involvement in activities prejudicial to national security as a badge of honour. For the rest of us, it is unquestionably <i>prima facie</i> defamatory if the association and accusation turn out not to be true.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Having come to this conclusion, it is necessary to examine whether the defence of qualified privilege arises.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Qualified Privilege</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Limited &amp; Ors</i> [2001] 2 AC 127, Albert Reynolds, a former Irish Prime Minister was accused in the British press of deliberately misleading the Irish Parliament. Reynolds sued for defamation and the defendants pleaded, <i>inter alia</i>, qualified privilege. The House of Lords held that the defence of qualified privilege would be available in respect of political information when the defendant satisfied the old common law test, ie: "where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social, or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it". The public statement, including any press statement, in respect of the arrest and detention of the plaintiffs under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;;">ISA</LINK> pending further inquiries, is therefore necessarily protected by qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> An arrest and detention under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;;">ISA</LINK>, being without trial, is always a matter of public concern. A timely public statement by the authorities in explanation of such action, is very much in the public interest, to assure the public that the power to arrest and detain under it was not being abused. The public statement is in fact a detainee's best protection, being the publicisation of his plight into the public notice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> In <i>Loutchansky v. Times Newspapers Ltd and Others (Nos 2-5)</i> [2001] EWCA Civ 1805, it was explained by the English Court of Appeal that while the interest served was that of the public in a modern democracy in free expression and in a free and vigorous press, the corresponding duty upon the journalist was to discharge that function by behaving as a responsible journalist.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The logic must equally follow from the elucidation in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_72;"><i>PP v. Ooi Kee Saik &amp; Ors</i> [1971] 1 MLRH 72</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 108 and <i>Loutchansky v. Times Newspapers Ltd and Others (Nos 2-5) (supra)</i> that while police powers of arrest and detention pending inquiries is a necessity in cases affecting national security, there is a duty upon the police to act responsibly and not abuse the power. Likewise while qualified privilege is a defence, it is not an absolute defence and malice, as an abuse of that defence, negates it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Certainly, in our view, the exercise of the draconian powers to arrest and detain pending inquiries on the grounds the police have reason to believe there are grounds which would justify the plaintiffs' detention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8</LINK> and that they had acted or are about to act or are likely to act in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia or any part thereof or to the maintenance of essential services therein or to the economic life thereof, calls for occasion to explain to the public the exercise of the power to reassure the public that the draconian powers were not being abused, because it is only too easy and even perhaps tempting to label political opponents as a security threat and thus justifying their arrest and detention. There is thus a duty to explain so that the public is not only informed of such arrest but is also assured that the draconian powers were not abused. Such an occasion is unquestionably an occasion of privilege and statements made thereat for general publication calls for protection by qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> But it is equally unquestionable that if the occasion is abused, no defence of qualified privilege can be sustained even if an occasion for qualified privilege does arise to make a press statement.</p>

    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We bear in mind also the impeccable elucidation in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1971_1_72;"><i>PP v. Ooi Kee Saik &amp; Ors</i> [1971] 1 MLRH 72</LINK>; [1971] 2 MLJ 108 by Raja Azlan Shah J (as His Majesty then was) on the balance between the Government's duty to preserve public peace and order, and therefore the right to legislate laws to do so, and the public right of lawful criticism of the Government:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> As to who should be the judge of what national security requires, Lord Parker delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee in <i>The Zamora</i> [1916] 2 AC 77, 107, had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In The Secretary of State for the <i>Home Department v. Rehman</i> [2002] 1 All ER 122, Lord Slynn in the House of Lords expressed the view that the threat need not be a direct threat to national security so that the executive is not hampered from assessing how to protect the interests of the state, which include "not merely military defence but democracy", and "the legal and constitutional systems of the state. Lord Slynn found it self-evident that "national courts must give great weight to the views of the executive on matters of national security", and it "should not ordinarily interfere with a case in which it considers that the view of the Home Secretary is one which could reasonably be entertained."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Even though the police's assessment of what amounts to a threat to national security must be given latitude and weight, it does not mean it is not open to examination subsequently, otherwise the public has no protection from the police purporting to act in the name of national security when they are not. The powers cannot be abused or exercised arbitrarily with impunity. In <i>Council for Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service</i> [1984] 3 All ER 935, which discussed <i>The Zamora (supra)</i>, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton explained:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Hence, it is not that the actions to protect national security cannot be challenged at all, but where it is successfully challenged, it must be answered. If it cannot answer, legal consequences may follow. It is the obvious counterpoise in the system of check and balance that while powers of arrest and detention in the interests of national security are necessary, and are unacceptable to or feared by only those who expect to engage in such activities, it is equally obvious it is a power that must be exercised responsibly and not abused. It follows therefore that merely maintaining that the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73</LINK> had been followed and there was prior investigation by Bahagian Risikan is not a sufficient answer to challenge to the assessment and decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> We recognise it may be difficult to successfully challenge the assessment and decision, given the nature of the evidence and the confidential nature of investigations on threats to national security. Activities prejudicial to national security more often than not are conducted secretly. The nature of investigations may necessarily be confidential, where disclosure may endanger the sources and compromise the ability to investigate. A maximum 15-day remand under the Criminal Procedure Code means that an arrest is authorised only when the better part of an investigation had been completed and evidence obtained before it arrested is authorised. The two months' maximum detention under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73 of the ISA</LINK> reflects recognition of the difficulty to gather evidence ultimately to satisfy the Minister under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8</LINK> to make a detention order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Ironically, direct evidence to prove involvement in activities prejudicial to national security is as notoriously hard to come by, as it is to successfully challenge the Government's assessment and decision as to threat to national security. But that is not to say it can never be proved, because total secrecy is not possible. If a person is arrested and detained, relatives, friends and associates will know he is missing. The person arrested and detained himself not only knows of his arrest and detention, but also how he is dealt with or treated while he is under arrest and detention. These may show whether the police officer acting under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73</LINK> had reason to believe that there are grounds which would justify detention of that person under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;8.;;">s 8</LINK> and that the person had acted or was about to act or was likely to act in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia or any part thereof or to the maintenance of essential services therein or to the economic life thereof. That person may be able to identify the persons having charge of him when arrested and detained, require their attendance as witnesses, and if necessary to call them and examine them as hostile witnesses.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In this case, the evidence was unchallenged that the plaintiffs were not questioned or required to explain as to their activities purported to be prejudicial to the security of Malaysia. There was no explanation in evidence as to why they did not do so. Furthermore the defendant's witnesses DW1, DW2, DW3 and DW4 did not say, giving reasons, that they were not able to disclose the evidence they found, but on the contrary admitted they did not find anything to link the plaintiffs to the militant activities, and that the interrogations had nothing to do with national security.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The press statement had asserted that the arrest and detention were made upon information obtained. That the information was obtained by the Bahagian Risikan and supplied to the 1st defendant is no defence that the 1st defendant can rely on to show lack of malice. The explanation provided by the press statement meant there was already some evidence before the plaintiffs were arrested and detained under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73</LINK> for further inquiries. The admissions of DW1, DW2, DW3 and DW4 meant that the press statement, and</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>was incorrect and not true when it gave the inference there was some evidence against the plaintiffs of their activities prejudicial to the security of Malaysia when they were arrested and detained pending further inquiries. The press statement, issued to assure the public that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;73.;;">s 73 of the ISA</LINK> was not being abused, was in the circumstances made recklessly by the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> We note that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> It is trite that truth (justification) is a complete defence, but where a statement alleged to be defamatory is unable to be defended by a defendant as being true, then the defence of qualified privilege may be relied upon to provide a defence, if it is made upon an occasion as described in <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Limited &amp; Ors (supra)</i>, being communication on an occasion where it appears there is a duty to make a statement, and the persons to whom it was made had a corresponding interest to receive it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The defence of qualified privilege is relied upon primarily when one is unable to prove the truth of the statement, or when the statement made is untrue. The defence of qualified privilege is therefore a defence upon the basis that even though the statement made was unable to be proved as true, or is in fact untrue, it was made in good faith upon an occasion when there is a duty to make the statement to parties who have an interest to receive it. That good faith is negated, and the defence of qualified privilege with it, when the occasion is abused to make the statements that are defamatory. The law of defamation must strike a balance between the duty to make the press statement and protecting persons against untrue statements that harm them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Amongst the old cases the reading of which provide diversion to judges, are <i>Dawkins v. Lord Paulet</i> [1869] LR 5 QB 94 and <i>Bradford Corp v. Pickles</i> [1895] AC 587. In <i>Dawkins v. Lord Paulet (supra)</i>, a captain sued the major general commanding the brigade alleging libel in a report on the captain. It was held by a majority that even though there was malice and absence of any reasonable or probable cause, the major-general was not liable. Cockburn CJ, dissenting, held the view that the major-general would lose his defence if the captain proves he lacked "<i>bona fides</i>". Mellor J considered that where a person is doing his duty, the question of malice was irrelevant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> In <i>Bradford Corp v. Pickles (supra)</i>, the respondent diverted water so that it no longer flowed to his neighbour's property. The purpose appeared to be to force the neighbour to buy his property at a higher price. It was held that no one has a right to divert water flowing to their property, and therefore the diversion by proprietor did not constitute a nuisance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> On the face of it, these cases appear to lend support to the argument that the defendants having the responsibility to maintain security of Malaysia, and in using the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;;">ISA</LINK>, had a duty to make the press statement to assure the public that the powers of arrest and detention pending inquiries were not being abused, cannot be held liable for defamation in a press statement issued in explanation, even if there was malice.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> However, the argument would not be in accord with the present day developments in judicial review where in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, judicial scrutiny is directed to examination of whether the executive power was exercised without illegality, procedural impropriety or irrationality (see <i>Council for Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (supra)</i>), meaning that the executive power must be exercised in good faith and not abused. The notion that that there could be no liability for the wrong or spiteful exercise of a right is inconsistent with these principles of judicial review. In <i>Horrocks v. Lowe</i> [1975] AC 135, Lord Diplock had this to say:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> When the press statement was considered together with the admissions of DW1, DW2, DW3 and DW4 and the unexplained absence of evidence and questioning or confronting the plaintiffs as to their activities alleged to be prejudicial to the security of Malaysia, one was led to the conclusion that the press statement was made to justify the arrest and detention without there being evidence of the plaintiffs' activities that were prejudicial to the security of Malaysia which would have justified action under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1972_82;;">s 73 of the ISA</LINK> for further enquiries. Strictly the press conference was not an occasion of qualified privilege, or even if the occasion were accepted as one of qualified privilege, the press statement, being, from the admissions of DW1, DW2, DW3 and DW4 to be without basis, was none other than reckless and without foundation, and the protection of qualified privilege was thereby lost.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> We would, therefore, dismiss the defendants' appeal on qualified privilege.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Quantum Of Damages, Defamation And False Imprisonment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The 5th plaintiff did not appeal against the finding of the High Court to exclude the 5th plaintiff and entering judgment in favour of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th plaintiffs only. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th plaintiffs appealed against the quantum of RM100,000.00 (RM60,000.00 general damages and RM40,000.00 aggravated and exemplary damages) awarded by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> The defendants appealed against the award of damages in respect of false imprisonment at RM15,000.00 per day.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> We accept the submission that in defamation cases, general damages are essentially the compensation order by the court for damage done to the plaintiff's reputation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> In giving the circumstances and the submissions our anxious consideration, we appreciated an important distinction. This case is not a defamation action against another private person or company. It is against public officers with a public duty and responsibility to act to protect national security and to make the press statement, and the Government being held vicariously liable for their actions. With duty and responsibility of Government on one side and the persons arrested and detained and press statement made in respect of them and their arrest and detention on the other, what is a public officer to do when he is cast by such persons into the role of an opponent, challenged, castigated, accused and condemned, and their very act condemned if not for one reason, then another. It is a predicament that leaves the officer with nowhere to turn and no one to rightly trust. In the absence of evidence of actual malice on the part of the 1st defendant, we conclude the recklessness in this case was a mistake made in difficult circumstances, resulting from public officers succumbing to using the powers when they are not justified.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> As much as we appreciate the injury suffered by the plaintiffs, it must be balanced against the interests of the State and the nation, and that includes all of its citizens, for whose interests the plaintiffs no doubt would be happy to represent. If the plaintiffs' purposes are to act, to take risks and make sacrifices if necessary for the people, it would be odd that the citizens indirectly have to now pay the plaintiffs' substantial damages for the defamation. We think that more often than not in such circumstances, the sacrifices, where warranted, and the vindication of a judgment are more valuable than any purely monetary award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> We were, therefore, not persuaded that there has been such an error to warrant appellate intervention in the exercise of discretion by the trial judge in the award as to damages for defamation. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal by the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th plaintiffs on the quantum of damages for defamation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> Since the defendants' appeal is confined to quantum of damages for false imprisonment, it is unnecessary:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The High Court dealt with the issue of damages for unlawful arrest and false imprisonment between paras 36 and 39 of the grounds of judgment. The High Court had awarded RM15,000.00 per day.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The Senior Federal Counsel referred to the decision of this court in:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>[58] In <i>McGregor on Damages</i>, it was observed by the learned commentator that:</p>
    <p>"The details on how damages are worked out in false imprisonment are few: generally it is not pecuniary loss but a loss of dignity and the like and is left much to the jury's and judge's discretion. The principal heads of claim would appear to be the injury to liberty, ie, the loss of time considered primarily from a non-pecuniary viewpoint, and the injury to feelings, ie, the indignity, mental suffering, disgrace and humiliation with any attendant loss of social status and injury to reputation ... In addition there may be recovery for any resultant physical injury, illness or discomfort ... further any pecuniary loss which is not too remote is recoverable; there appears to be no modern reported cases ... that any loss of general business or employment is recoverable would seem to follow from <i>Childs v. Lewis</i> ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The point made in <i>McGregor</i> is that the principle of damages for false imprisonment is not a pecuniary loss but for the loss of dignity by the false arrest and imprisonment, but a pecuniary loss can be recovered provided it is pleaded and not too remote.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The claim in this case is predicated upon false imprisonment only, and as in <i>Penguasa Tempat Tahanan Perlindungan Kamunting, Taiping &amp; Anor v. Badrul Zaman PS Md Zakariah (supra)</i>, we hold that the pleadings nor the evidence adduced do not provide support for a claim for pecuniary loss.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Case-law in respect of damages for false imprisonment, was reviewed in <i>Penguasa Tempat Tahanan Perlindungan Kamunting, Taiping &amp; Anor v. Badrul Zaman PS Md Zakariah (supra)</i>. The award of RM3,000,000.00 pegged at the rate of RM20,000.00 per day and discounted at 50% was reduced to an award of RM300,000.00, effectively amounting to RM1,000.00 per day.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> This court in <i>Penguasa Tempat Tahanan Perlindungan Kamunting, Taiping &amp; Anor v. Badrul Zaman PS Md Zakariah (supra)</i> has stated that the total amount for longer periods is not a case of simple arithmetical progression, but that that damages awarded must be "sufficient" since it will be in the public interest to award more than nominal damages "in order to give reality to the protection afforded by law to personal freedom". This is because the fact remains that the false imprisonment remains one and the same. False imprisonment is not a separate wrong each determined upon a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Nor is it upon an hourly or minute by minute basis. Nevertheless it is unarguable that although the severity of false imprisonment is not necessarily upon an arithmetical progression, the longer the false imprisonment the more severe is the tort. In our view, the circumstances is always relevant including the reasons given for the arrest and detention, whether efforts made to seek release was actively resisted. If a person did not seek release, but was happy to remain in detention albeit unlawfully, he cannot be said to have suffered much loss of dignity and he should not use the occasion for lucrative income by claiming damages. Ultimately the damages is for what is pleaded, the evidence adduced in respect thereof, and only for damages that is reasonably foreseeable and reasonable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> In <i>Penguasa Tempat Tahanan Perlindungan Kamunting, Taiping &amp; Anor v. Badrul Zaman PS Md Zakariah (supra)</i>, personal freedom was curtailed for acting:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> That case involved 32 fake visas and successfully organising the departure of about 175 persons who had overstayed in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> From the press statement, the instant case involved not persons in criminal activities for personal gain, but persons in political activities whom the police stated it "had reason to believe" were involved in activities prejudicial to the security of Malaysia but at the trial, neither evidence for such reason to believe was produced nor reasons for the failure to do so was presented in the trial, leading to the conclusion there was no basis for the arrest and detention, and that the plaintiffs were arrested for their political activities. Such arrest and detention strikes at the very heart of a democracy, and in our view, is a much more serious assault on personal liberty and with very much less justification for arrest and detention. The Constitution expects from the police a fair, objective and independent approach in respect of political activities, as it is the key to a functioning democratic system. The police must be seen to be fair, objective and independent. Only when respected as being fair, objective and independent can it be effective in serving its function within the law. For this reason a sufficient award in this case must be substantially more than in a case such as <i>Penguasa Tempat Tahanan Perlindungan Kamunting, Taiping &amp; Anor v. Badrul Zaman PS Md Zakariah (supra)</i>. A sum ranging between RM400,000.00 and RM550,000.00 would be appropriate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> We would, therefore, allow the appeal on damages for false imprisonment in part to reduce the award of general damages to RM10,000.00 per day.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> We conclude with the observation that the fundamental constitutional principle is that the rights and liberties of persons and powers of the institutions of the State are balanced against each other in the interests of the security of Malaysia or any part thereof, the maintenance of essential services therein and the economic life thereof. No right, liberty or power is absolute. Acceptance and adherence to the principle are essential to the functioning of the Constitution.</p>

      <b>[68]</b> Accordingly we:</p>
