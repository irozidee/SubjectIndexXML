    <p>The accused was convicted on two charges in the High Court under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;;">Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ('the Act')</LINK>, to wit: (i) trafficking in 253.97 grams of heroin and monoacetylmorphines contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(1)(a) of the Act</LINK> and punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2)</LINK> thereof, and (ii) unauthorised possession of 14.84 grams of methamphetamine contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;12.;;">s 12(2)</LINK> punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39A.;;">s 39A(1) of the Act</LINK>. The accused appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and sentence. The accused appealed on grounds that: (a) the drugs were in two locations but the High Court only made one finding and (b) the High Court had failed to consider the evidence of SD2 - the wife of the accused - who had access to the drugs, thereby giving rise to a reasonable doubt in respect of exclusive custody and control.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The fact that the drugs were found in different bags and packages did not mean that they were found in such different locations as would necessitate separate scrutiny and appreciation. The different bags and packages were in the same room. The substances in the bags and packages in the room were heroin and monoacetylmorphines as charged. There was nothing demonstrated of the difference in nature or circumstances as to require separate scrutiny and appreciation. (para 7)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The fact of non-exclusive possession does not negate guilt. Even if the appellant did not have exclusive access and control because SD2 also had access, it would only mean that they both had joint possession. In the instant case, there was no evidence that SD2 had access to the room, let alone the substances containing the dangerous drugs. Her access to the drugs was purely speculative. (paras 25-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The quantity of drugs was inconsistent with possession for the purpose of consumption. The paraphernalia for weighing, packaging and sealing in plastic packets pointed to no other object but to traffic in the substance containing the dangerous drugs. The fact that while the accused was the tenant of the room, neither he nor his wife and step-children had any clothes and personal effects there showed that the room was maintained at the material time as a storage and packaging location for the purpose of trafficking in the substances found therein.

    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The accused Nagalingam a/l P Vellupillay ("the appellant") appealed against his conviction and sentence for:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This court dismissed the appeals and affirmed the conviction and sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Briefly, the prosecution case was that on 2 February 2010 at about 3.00am, Insp Mohd Azri bin Mat Yussof (PW5) led a police party to conduct a raid at a house bearing the address No: 6784A, Jalan Langkawi, Tai On Garden, Batu 4, Gombak, Kuala Lumpur, in respect of another offence. Upon arrival, PW5 found the front grill and wooden doors were opened and the key to the front wooden door in the key hole of the lock at the centre of the door knob of the wooden door. While proceeding to enter the house with two of his men, PW5 saw the appellant coming out from a room located near the toilet. Introducing himself as a police officer, he saw that the appellant was holding a transparent plastic packet (P22) in his left hand. Seising the packet, PW5 found that it contained a substance he suspected to be a dangerous drug. The packet was later found to contain 14.84 grams of methamphetamine, the subject of the second charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> It is also the prosecution case that upon entering the room that the appellant came out from, PW5 found:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> PW5 issued a search list, P19 to the appellant, detailing out the seised items and the location where they were situated at the time of their seisure.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Grounds Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The grounds of appeal were that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Drugs In Two Locations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> That the drugs were found in different bags and packages does not mean they were found in such different locations as would necessitate separate scrutiny and appreciation. The different bags and packages were in the same room. The substances in the bags and packages in the room were heroin and monoacetylmorphines as charged. There is nothing demonstrated of the difference in nature or circumstances as to require separate scrutiny and appreciation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> If any drug was in a different location, it was the methamphetamine in the bag the appellant was found holding. For this drug, he was separately charged under the second charge, and which was addressed by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> That aside, the two grounds are interlinked and we address the two grounds together.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The submission began with trite law as to the physical and mental elements of possession (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1997_2_311;"><i>Muhammed Hassan v. PP</i> [1997] 2 MLRA 311</LINK>; [1998] 2 MLJ 273; [1998] 2 CLJ 170; [1998] 1 AMR 829, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v.

    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Counsel relied upon <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_4_188;"><i>Yap Chin Chai v. PP</i> [2009] 4 MLRA 188</LINK>; [2011] 2 MLJ 632; [2010] 4 CLJ 693 to submit:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The High Court had, in the prosecution case, found in respect of:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The thrust of the submissions in the appeal is in respect of the first charge where the High Court held (pp 14-17 of grounds of judgment):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The passage of the grounds of judgment taken to task is at p 3 of the grounds of judgment where under the subject of <i>mens rea</i> possession, the High Court stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Relying upon <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_405;"><i>Choo Yoke Choy v. PP</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 405</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 632; [1992] 1 CLJ 43; [1992] 1 AMR 301, it was submitted that since there are three people who had access to the said house namely the appellant himself, his wife (SD2 Thenmoly a/p Satiyel) and the person whom the appellant subrented the house, Ah Soon, it was a misdirection for the High Court to deal with possession of the substance in the package found in the appellant's hands together with the substances the subject of the first charge found in the room. Driving home the point, it was submitted:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_246;"><i>Romi Amora Amir v. PP</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 246</LINK>; [2011] 4 MLJ 571; [2011] 1 CLJ 870, it was held that because the prosecution had failed to establish that the appellant knew the package was under his seat, it would naturally follow that he would not know the contents. That case concerned a package containing cannabis found under the driver's seat of the taxi the appellant drove and came out from. It was a small amount. It could possibly be placed or inserted by any passenger sitting in the rear passenger seat. Witness PW3 testified that he rented the taxi from the owner, and the appellant had borrowed the car from him. He further testified he did not find any plastic bag inside the taxi when it was sent for cleaning at the car wash centre.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the instant case, the yellow coloured plastic bag, the black and white paper bag and the three plastic bags, P36, P38 and P40, together with paraphernalia for weighing and packaging were on the floor of the room upon which there was a specific finding not appealed against that it was used as a storage place by the appellant. As found by SP5, it was in plain view on the right when he entered the room the appellant had immediately before came out from. Though the drugs were different from the drugs he was found holding, they are common drugs being trafficked. Also not appealed against were the findings that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we find <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_3_246;"><i>Romi Amora Amir v. PP</i> [2010] 3 MLRA 246</LINK>; [2011] 4 MLJ 571; [2011] 1 CLJ 870 distinguishable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> We observe that in the cross-examination to a question put to him, SP5 replied (RR1:48)</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In his testimony on oath, the appellant said he went to the premises after Ah Soon called him. He testified:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> He did not say the plastic and paper packages of substances containing the dangerous drugs were not there. Instead, in cross-examination, he said (RR1:132):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The crux of the defence is that the appellant did not have sole custody and control of the room in which the drugs were found. It was submitted that the High Court erred when it failed to accept that because SD2, Thenmoly a/p Satiyel, the wife of the appellant, had access to the drugs, a reasonable doubt had been established.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> From the foregoing, the finding was a finding of fact on the evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Furthermore, the relevance of exclusive access and control of a premise or room pertains to proof that he had possession of things found in the room. Whether he has possession of the things in the room is always a finding to be made upon the particular facts and circumstances. That another has access to the room does not mean he cannot be held to be in possession of the drugs found in the room if such access is only, for example, in his presence. The idea of exclusivity was explained in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2008_3_116;"><i>PP v. Denish Madhavan</i> [2008] 3 MLRA 116</LINK>; [2009] 2 MLJ 194; [2009] 2 CLJ 209, where the Federal Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Thomson J, in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_44;"><i>Chan Pean Leon v. PP</i> [1956] 1 MLRH 44</LINK>; [1956] 1 MLJ 237, said that "possession" for the purposes of criminal law involves possession itself - which some authorities term "custody" or "control" - and knowledge of the nature of the thing possessed. As to possession itself, he cited the following definition in <i>Stephen's Digest</i> (9<sup>th</sup> edn, p 304), in which the exclusive element mentioned by Thomson J appears:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Thus, that fact of non-exclusive possession does not negate guilt. Even if the submission that the appellant did not have exclusive access and control because his wife also had access were accepted, it would only mean on the facts of this case that they both had joint possession. The High Court considered the defence that the appellant's wife, SD2 had access and held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> There was no evidence of access at the material time to the room let alone the substances containing the dangerous drugs by SD2. Her access to the drugs is purely speculative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Other Observations</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We observe that the quantity of drugs is inconsistent with possession for the purpose of consumption. The paraphernalia for weighing, packaging and sealing in plastic packets point to no other object but to traffic in the substance containing the dangerous drugs. The fact that while the appellant was the tenant of the room, neither he nor his wife and step children had any clothes and personal effects there underlines that the room was maintained at the material time as a storage and packaging location for the purpose of trafficking in the substances found therein. We find no error in the High Court holding:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We, therefore, dismissed the appeals and affirm the conviction and sentence on both charges.</p>
