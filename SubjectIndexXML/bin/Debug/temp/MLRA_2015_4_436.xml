    <p>The appellants had an interlocutory application filed against them in the Singapore High Court for the disclosure of documents pertaining to the 1st appellant company. They then applied for leave to disclose the documents as the 1st appellant was a Labuan Trust Company and the appellants did not want the risk of contravening <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">subsection (1) of s 149 of the Labuan Companies Act 1990 ('the Act')</LINK> unless leave was given by the court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">subsections (4)(a) and (6) of s 149</LINK>. The High Court dismissed the application and the appellants now appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal</p>
    <p>Per Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA (David Wong Dak Wah JCA concurring):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Any disclosure of the business affairs of Labuan Companies to any person would be in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">subsection (1) of s 149 of the Act</LINK>. However, by reason of the definition of the word "Court" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> and the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;8.;;">s 8(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>, the word "Court" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149</LINK> could only mean the High Court of Malaya or the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak. It could not mean to include the High Court of Singapore. (paras 36 &amp; 38)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was misconceived for the appellants to argue that they were "lawfully required" under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4)(a) of the Act</LINK> to make the disclosure by either the High Court of Malaya or the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak. That was because if any order were to be made by the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at Labuan pursuant to the appellants' application, it would be made pursuant to the appellants' voluntary application. There was no element of being "lawfully required". An application for disclosure could only be made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">subsection (6) of s 149</LINK> to the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak or to the High Court of Malaya, as the case might be. Even then, the application could only be made if there were proceedings pending in the High Court in question and that it was necessary for the High Court to order production of a document that was relevant to the proceedings. (paras 40-41)</p>
    <p>Per Hamid Sultan Backer JCA (supporting judgment):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The laws of one country could not restrain the jurisdiction and/or power of the court in another country, in this case Singapore. Courts in exercising their discretionary powers would often have due regard to the relevant laws of friendly countries if it was in issue under the comity and/or reciprocity principle. (para 46(i))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">Section 149 of the Act</LINK> as a whole did not deal with jurisdiction and/or powers of other courts and/or interference with the discretionary relief of courts of other countries. Even if it was Malaysia, the secrecy provision stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(1)</LINK> was not absolute and was qualified by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4) and (6) of the Act</LINK>. As a general rule, the courts often shunned privacy and/or confidentiality when it was needed for the public good. No information of any kind could be absolutely restrained by agreement of the parties and/or statute from the purview of the courts under the Federal Constitution in breach of the fundamental jurisprudence relating to accountability and transparency to the court. In addition, statutes such as the Money Laundering Act in different countries would require disclosure and countries might have international obligations to ensure "absolute secrecy" provisions were not placed in their legislation which might promote money-laundering activities. (para 46 (ii)-(iii))</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The prohibition in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(1) of the Act</LINK> did not extend to disclosure or discovery before the Singapore High Court. If the Singapore court ordered disclosure or discovery, the appellants would be obliged to obey failing which committal proceedings might issue. In the circumstances, the appellants' application before the High Court was misconceived. (para 46(v))</p>

      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> Justice David Wong Dak Wah has read this judgment and agrees with it. However, Justice Hamid Sultan Abu Backer will be writing a separate supporting judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at the Federal Territory of Labuan given on 20 May 2014.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> On 13 February 2015 we dismissed the appeal with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We now give our grounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> This appeal concerns an application by way of an originating summons by all the three appellants before the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at the Federal Territory of Labuan for an order under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(6) of the Labuan Companies Act 1990 ('the Act')</LINK>. It is an application for permission or leave to disclose information pertaining to the affairs of three companies, two of which are established under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;;">the Act ('Labuan companies')</LINK> while the third is a company established under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">Companies Act 1965</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We are advised by counsel of parties appearing before us that this is the first case in Malaysia on issues of secrecy and disclosure under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;;">the Act</LINK> and that the judgment of this court on this appeal would set an important precedent that will have an impact on Labuan's reputation as an international business and financial center. The judgment will also affect the confidence of foreign investors in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 1st appellant (Portcullis Trustnet (Singapore) Pte Ltd), the 2nd appellant (Portcullis Trustnet (Labuan) Ltd ('Portcullis Labuan')), and another company called 'Portcullis (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd' (later renamed 'Portcullis Trustnet (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd'), are all part of a group of companies located in offshore jurisdictions (the "Portcullis Group"), with the headquarters located in Singapore. The Portcullis Group provides services such as company incorporation, secretarial and administration services and trustee services.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Portcullis Labuan (the 2nd appellant) is a Labuan Trust Company incorporated in the Federal Territory of Labuan under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;;">Labuan Companies Act 1990</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The 3rd appellant, Chong Kok Kong David, is the founder and Chairman of the Portcullis Group. He is also a Director of the 1st and 2nd appellants. Now, what had happened was that, there are two brothers in India by the name of Ram Parshotam Mittal ('Ram Mittal') and Ashok Kumar Mittal ('Ashok Mittal'). They are shareholders of a company incorporated in India called 'Hotel Queen Road Pvt Ltd' ('Hotel Queen'). A dispute arose between Ram Mittal on one side and Ashok Mittal and the other shareholders of Hotel Queen on the other, over the control of the hotel. Because of this dispute, since 2005, there had been various legal proceedings between the parties in India.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 3 November 2011, Ram Mittal commenced an action in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore ('Singapore suit') against the appellants. The suit was registered as High Court of Singapore Suit No: 785 of 2011/T.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The dispute in the Singapore suit focusses on two companies which Ram Mittal claims were set up, managed and administered by the appellants on his behalf. These companies are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The crux of Ram Mittal's action in the Singapore suit is the allegation of breach of contract, breach of trust, and breach of duty of care against the appellants in respect of the setting up, management and administration of the 1st respondent and Hillcrest Realty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Ram Mittal alleges in his statement of claim, amongst other things, that it was "at all times intended, understood, and agreed ...' between the parties that he was to be the sole and ultimate beneficial owner of the 1st respondent and Hillcrest Realty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The 1st and 2nd appellants in their joint statement of defence assert, among other things, that the share of the 1st respondent was to be held by the 2nd appellant in trust as a bare trustee and/or nominee for both Ram Mittal and Ashok Mittal. In other words, Ashok Mittal is also a beneficial owner of the shares in the 1st respondent and in Hillcrest Realty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> This Singapore suit is still pending.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On 26 March 2013, Ram Mittal filed an interlocutory application in the High Court of Singapore for an order that the 1st and 2nd appellants produce for inspection and permit the taking of copies by Ram Mittal or his solicitors of the documents that relate to the business and affairs of the 1st respondent and Hillcrest Realty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Originating Summons Application Before The High Court Of Labuan</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the application before the High Court of Labuan, the appellants seek an order to grant them liberty to disclose information pertaining to affairs of the 2nd appellant (Portcullis Labuan), the 1st respondent (Cardiff Ltd) and/or Hillcrest Sdn Bhd for the purpose of the Singapore suit. The relevant prayers in the originating summons read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It is to be observed that Hillcrest Realty is not a Labuan company but an ordinary company established under the Companies Act 1965. Nevertheless information pertaining to the business and affairs of this company is also included in the appellants' originating summons application. The reason for so including this particular company is explained in the supporting affidavit as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> After this application was filed, Ashok Mittal applied to intervene and was added as the 2nd respondent in the originating summons. He is opposing any disclosure pertaining to the affairs of Cardiff Ltd on the ground that the disclosure of information pertaining to the affairs of a Labuan company are protected by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149 of the Labuan Companies Act 1990</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Ram Mittal, the plaintiff in the Singapore suit, is not a party in the originating summons application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The 1st respondent, Cardiff Ltd, did not participate in the originating summons proceedings; neither did it participate in the hearing of this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The appellants have submitted an affidavit in support of their application. It is deposed by one Tan Sze Lian Celine (NRIC No S0106658G), a Singaporean citizen. She is a Director of the 1st appellant and an alternate Director of the 2nd appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The appellants, by their affidavit, state that in order to defend the claims made against them in the Singapore suit by Ram Mittal, they are compelled to disclose information pertaining to the business affairs of the Labuan companies (meaning, Portcullis Labuan and Cardiff Ltd) and Hillcrest Realty.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The appellants also deposed that Ram Mittal has filed an interlocutory application against the 1st and 2nd appellants in the Singapore suit for inspection and taking of copies of documents relating to the business affairs of the Labuan companies and Hillcrest Realty. Thus, the appellants have pleaded in this application that they would run the risk of contravening <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(1) of the Labuan Companies Act 1990</LINK> unless leave is given by this court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4)(a) and (6)</LINK>.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> For ease of reference, we reproduce below the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> By the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_AMEN_2010_1367;;">Offshore Companies (Amendment) Act 2010</LINK>, the Offshore Companies Act 1990 (Act 441) was amended to become the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;;">Labuan Companies Act 1990</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The respective definitions of "Court" and "court" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The definition of 'court' was inserted by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_AMEN_2010_1367;2.;;">s 2 of the Offshore Companies (Amendment) Act 2010</LINK>; and by this amendment the Act has made a distinction between 'Court' and 'court'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The term 'High Court' is not defined by the Act. But <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;8.;;">s 8(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In dismissing the originating summons, the learned High Court Judge analysed <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149</LINK> and takes the following view:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Submission Of The Appellants</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The learned counsel for the appellants submits before us that for the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149 of the Act</LINK> the word 'Court' must be interpreted to also include the High Court of Singapore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The learned counsel for the appellants also refers to the general common law principles that govern disclosure in a trustee-beneficiary relationship with a view to persuading us to grant the application. Among the cases cited was <i>Re B</i> [2012] 15 ITELR 784, a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Guernsey.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submission Of The 2nd Respondent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent on the other hand contends that the word "Court" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(6) of the Act</LINK> can only refer to the High Court of Malaya or the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak; and cannot include the Singapore High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The learned counsel further submits that it is misconceived for the appellants to invoke <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4)(a)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(6) of the Act</LINK> as these provisions are never intended by the Act to be the vehicle for such an application.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> The learned counsel also made a general submission to the effect that the purpose of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149 of the Act</LINK> is to provide investors in Labuan companies with a secrecy and confidentiality structure for the conduct of their business. And that this being the case, investors in Labuan companies have a legitimate expectation that their legal rights to confidentiality will be protected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> It appears to be common grounds (and rightly so) that the 2nd appellant (Portcullis Labuan) and the 1st respondent (Cardiff Ltd) are Labuan companies, and that any disclosure as to their business affairs to any person would be in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">subsection (1) of s 149 of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> On our part, in the present case, we agree with the reasoning and decision of the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> In our judgment, by reason of the definition of the word 'Court' in s 2 of the Act and the provision of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1989_388;8.;;">s 8(1) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967</LINK>, we are in agreement with the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent and the learned High Court Judge that the word "Court" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149</LINK> can only mean the High Court of Malaya or the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak; and cannot include the High Court of Singapore.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> We agree with the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">subsection (4)(a) of s 149</LINK> is not a vehicle to obtain 'leave' or 'permission' from the court to disclose confidential information pertaining to the affairs of a Labuan company.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> And we would add that we accept the submission of the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent that, with regard to the invocation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4)(a)</LINK> by the appellants to permit disclosure, it is misconceived for the appellants to argue that they were 'lawfully required' (these words 'lawfully required' are the words used by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149(4)(a)</LINK>) to make the disclosure by either the High Court of Malaya or the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak; for, if at all any order were to be made by the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at Labuan, pursuant to the appellants' originating summons application, it would be made pursuant to the appellants' voluntary application. There is no element of being 'lawfully required'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> We further subscribe to the view that an application for disclosure could only be made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">subsection (6) of s 149</LINK> to a High Court of Sabah and Sarawak or to a High Court of Malaya, as the case may be; and, even then, the application could only be made if there are proceedings pending in the High Court in question and that it is necessary for the High Court to order production of a document that is relevant to the proceedings.</p>

Upon hearing, we were unanimous in dismissing the appeal. I have informed the parties that my reason for dismissing the appeal is not on the same grounds of that of my learned brothers Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA and David Wong Dak Wah JCA. This judgment must be read with the judgment of my learned brother Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA to appreciate the facts and issues in the right perspective. I now give my reasons for my decision.</p>

      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The facts, law and the contention of the parties have been well articulated by the learned High Court Judge and I do not wish to repeat the same save to the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149 LCA 1990</LINK> and its applicability before the High Court which the appellants have filed as a cautionary measure to ensure not to attract any penal sanction for disclosure of documents pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149 of LCA 1990</LINK>. The section reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> It is not in dispute that the 1st appellant is a Labuan Trust Company incorporated under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;;">Labuan Companies Act 1990</LINK>. The 1st appellant has nexus to the 2nd and 3rd appellant. Two brothers Ashok Kumar Mittal and Ram Parshotam Mittal who are Indian citizens are engaged in a caustic dispute among themselves in a litigation and the related action is pending in Singapore High Court. Both of the brothers have nexus or claim or link or issues and/or interest, etc in respect of the relevant parties to this appeal. In the Singapore suit, Ram Parshotam Mittal has sued the appellants in respect of the respondent company. The appellants here need to disclose information of the 1st appellant in the Singapore suit as Ram Parshotam Mittal has filed an interlocutory application against the 1st and 2nd appellants for disclosure of documents. If disclosure is made, the appellants take the view that they may run the risk of breaching <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1990_441;149.;;">s 149 of LCA 1990</LINK>. Hence, the suit. It is of interest to note that Ashok Kumar Mittal intervened in this suit and has been made the 2nd respondent. His purpose is to oppose disclosure.</p>

      <b>[46]</b> I have read the Appeal Record and the able submissions of the learned counsel for the respective parties. I agree with the learned High Court Judge that the application for leave is misconceived but for different reasons. My reasons are as follows:</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> For reasons stated above, I dismiss the appeal with no order as to costs as per the unanimous decision of this court. The deposit is to be refunded.</p>

      <b>[48]</b> I hereby order so.</p>
