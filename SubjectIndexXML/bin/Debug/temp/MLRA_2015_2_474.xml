    <p>The appellant was charged with trafficking in methamphetamine, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952</LINK>. At the material time, the raiding officer ("SP2") and his team were on surveillance duties at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport when they saw the appellant behaving suspiciously after collecting a brown bag. SP2 decided to detain and question the appellant. Following a check on the brown bag, eight boxes, each containing an oil filter of the same size and model were discovered, and inside these oil filters a total of 24 transparent plastic packets ("the exhibits") wrapped with blue carbon papers ("the carbon papers") were found. The exhibits were weighed at the scene by SP2. At the Sepang District Police Headquarters, the drugs were again weighed, this time by the Investigating Officer ("SP6") using a digital weighing scale. Finally, the gross weight of the exhibits was determined by the chemist ("SP5") using a calibrated digital weighing machine and the exhibits were found to contain methamphetamine ("the drugs"). At the trial, the trial judge accepted SP2 and SP6 as witnesses of truth, and concluded that the drugs produced in court were the same drugs that were seized from the appellant; that there was no break in the chain of evidence relating to the exhibits; that the appellant had <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs; and that the appellant's act of carrying the drugs was an act of trafficking. Consequently, he found that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out against the appellant and called for the appellant's defence. Having considered the defence explanation, he rejected the defence as being a bare denial. The appellant was found guilty and sentenced to death. In this appeal, the appellant raised <i>inter alia</i>, the following issues in relation to the identification of the exhibits, that there was a discrepancy in the number of packets comprising the exhibits confiscated by SP2; that the prosecution failed to produce the carbon papers used to wrap the exhibits; that an adverse inference could be drawn based on the prosecution's failure to explain the existence of the brown tapes on the exhibits; that the exhibits produced in court were not the exhibits seized; that there was a break in the chain of movement of the exhibits; that there was a difference in the gross weight of the exhibits; and that there was a discrepancy between the oral testimony of SP5 and his Chemist Report ("P33").</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Upon carefully considering the evidence, it was clear that there were only 24 packets seized. No doubt SP2 in the search list recorded 16 twin packets but this part of his evidence must not be isolated from the rest of the evidence. Considered in its entirety and tested against the rest of the evidence it was clear that SP2 had only seized eight twin packets and not 16. Further, SP5 confirmed in no uncertain terms that he received 24 plastic packets. If there was still a lingering doubt as to the actual number of plastic packets seized, the evidence by SP2 in the record of appeal in which he stated clearly that there were 24 packets removed such doubt. Hence, the discrepancy, although material, was explainable. (paras 13-17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The trial judge's approach in dealing with the identity of the drug exhibits was beyond reproach, and he had also sufficiently addressed the failure by the prosecution to produce the carbon papers and concluded that the failure did not affect the quantity nor the nature of the drugs as each of the packets was intact and had been properly marked. On the evidence no valid criticism could be leveled against the trial judge for arriving at such a finding. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> A grave suggestion should never be made without basis and without giving the witnesses any opportunity to explain. In this instance, there was no evidential basis for drawing an adverse inference against the failure of the prosecution to explain the existence of the brown tapes nor was the suggestion that the exhibits had been tampered with put to any of the prosecution witnesses. Thus, even without the carbon papers and the failure to explain how the brown tapes came to be wrapped around the said packets, the chain of evidence relating to the drug exhibits remained intact. (paras 19-20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> It is true that failure on the part of the accused to put his case to the relevant witnesses can never, by itself, relieve the prosecution of its duty of establishing the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. (<i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. PP (refd)</i>). However, such failure also means that the testimony given could not be disputed at all. (<i>AEG Carapiet v. Derderian (refd)</i>). In the instant case, there was no challenge to the markings that SP6 made on the exhibits, nor his positive identification of the markings in court. Further, SP5's testimony that the crystalline substances that he examined were the exhibits that SP6 handed over to him was not challenged at all. Consequently, the appellant was deemed to have accepted SP5's evidence that the substances that he examined and found the drugs were the exhibits that SP6 handed over to him. (paras 23, 24 &amp; 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> Here, the discrepancy on the weight of the drugs was explainable. SP2's testimony was that he used an uncalibrated weighing machine to weigh the drugs, while SP6 used a digital but uncalibrated weighing scale and SP5 used a digital and calibrated weighing scale which resulted in a difference of only seven grams. Surely it could not be expected that the weights would be accurate to the last decimal point. Therefore, the discrepancy in the gross weight of the drugs was not a serious discrepancy as to cast a serious doubt on the identity of the exhibits. What was important was whether the right exhibits had been produced in court. Furthermore, the trial judge had seriously considered whether there was a break in the chain of evidence relating to the exhibits and he was satisfied that there was none. On the evidence adduced, the trial judge was perfectly entitled to arrive at such finding. (paras 29-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The testimony of SP5 was that after homogenizing the crystalline substances he carried out the three tests on three different dates. It was not his evidence that he carried out the three tests on the same date that he homogenised the crystalline substances. Accordingly, there was no substance in the alleged discrepancy between the oral testimony of SP5 and P33. (para 36)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Rahman Sebli JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged with trafficking in 1,488 grams of methamphetamine, an offence punishable under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;39B.;;">s 39B(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1952 ('the Act')</LINK>. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by the Shah Alam High Court. This is his appeal against the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The salient facts are as follows. On 22 January 2011 at about 4.00pm the raiding officer (SP2) and his team were on surveillance duties at carousel G Level 3 of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport when they saw the appellant carrying a brown bag (P12) on his way out through the Customs counter. He had just arrived from Doha, Kuwait by Emirates Airlines flight QR624 and the luggage tag bore his name. Besides the brown bag he was also carrying a sling bag (P18).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> SP2 noticed that the appellant was behaving suspiciously because after collecting the brown bag from the carousel, he was walking back and forth as if not knowing where to go to. SP2 decided to detain him and introduced himself as a police officer. He asked the appellant in English where he was going to and the appellant answered he did not know.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> A check that was later carried out on the brown bag revealed eight boxes, each containing an oil filter of the same size and model. Inside each of the eight oil filters were found three transparent plastic packets wrapped with blue carbon papers, making a total of 24 packets. The eight oil filters where the 24 plastic packets were hidden were marked P15A to P15H by SP2. The appellant was present when SP2 checked the oil filters one by one. According to SP2 the appellant kept quiet throughout the checking although he had been told earlier that he was arrested for carrying the drugs into Malaysia.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The 24 plastic packets were weighed at the scene by SP2 and found to be about 2,000 grams. At the Sepang District Police Headquarters, the drugs were again weighed, this time by the Investigating Officer (SP6) using a digital weighing scale and the weight was 2,060 grams. Lastly the gross weight as determined by the chemist using a calibrated digital weighing machine was 2,067 grams. As for the actual methamphetamine content of the plastic packets, the chemist found the nett weight to be 1,488 grams. This is the weight that formed the subject matter of the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The learned trial judge accepted SP2 and SP6 as witnesses of truth. He said he had no reason to disbelieve them. He had no doubt in his mind that the drugs produced in court were the same drugs that were seized from the appellant, nor did he find any evidence of tampering. It was his finding that there was no break in the chain of evidence relating to the exhibits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On the issue of knowledge, the learned judge found that the appellant had <i>mens rea</i> possession of the drugs, citing the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_568;"><i>PP v. Abdul Rahman Akif</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 568</LINK>; [2007] 5 MLJ 1; [2007] 4 CLJ 337 where it was held, <i>inter alia</i> that what the court is required to do is to scrutinise the entire evidence to see whether an inference can be drawn against the respondent that he knew about the drugs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On the issue of trafficking the learned trial judge's finding is that the appellant's act of carrying the drugs was an act 'trafficking' as defined by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1980_234;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK>. Consequently he found that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out against the appellant and called for his defence. Having considered the defence explanation carefully, he rejected the defence as being a bare denial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Before us learned counsel for the appellant raised only one issue, ie the identity of the drug exhibits. According to counsel there are five areas of doubt, namely: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> It is obvious that the appellant's appeal is fact based and against findings which involved the credibility of the witnesses. His contention is that the learned trial judge was wrong in finding that the identity of the drugs had been proved. First, the number of drug packets seized. The appellant's argument is that while SP2's evidence shows that 24 packets of drugs were seized, the search list (P10) and the handing over list (P28) shows that 40 packets were seized, which was made up of 16 twin packets (thus making 32 packets) and eight other single packets.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> In other words the number of exhibits seized at the scene and the number of exhibits produced in court did not match. It was argued that the prosecution should have produced 40 plastic packets and not 24 and no explanation was offered for the shortfall. According to counsel this has resulted in a serious doubt on the identity of the drug exhibits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The absence of explanation per se of any discrepancy in the evidence does not ipso facto lead to a doubt on the identity of the exhibits. To be of any consequence two things must be shown:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We have carefully considered the evidence <i>vis-a-vis</i> the point raised and it is clear to us that there were only 24 plastic packets seized and not 40 as claimed by counsel. With due respect to the learned counsel he had made a serious arithmetical error in coming up with 16 twin packets when there were only eight. No doubt SP2 in the search list recorded 16 twin packets but this part of his evidence must not be isolated from the rest of the evidence. Considered in its entirety and tested against the rest of the evidence it is clear that SP2 had only seized eight twin packets and not 16.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In our view it was a genuine mistake by SP2 to have recorded 16 twin plastic packets in the search list. We are entitled to draw this conclusion as it is a matter of inference to be drawn from the evidence rather than a question that is dependent on the credibility of the witness alone. At the trial it was SP2's testimony that he could not remember what was it that he recorded as 16 twin packets. The mistake is understandable given that each of the two sets of plastic packets contained eight packets except that one of them was made up of twin packets, thus doubling the number to 16 packets.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The chemist's (SP5) testimony in this regard is that the exhibits marked RB1 to RB8 consisted of two plastic packets each, thus making a total of 16 packets. If we were to add this to the eight packets marked RB9 to RB16, which consisted of only one packet each the grand total would still be 24 packets.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> SP5 confirmed in no uncertain terms that he received 24 plastic packets from SP6. In cross-examination his evidence was that for the 16 plastic packets marked RB1 to RB16, eight of them were twin packets while the other eight were singles. This confirms that there were only eight twin packets and not 16. If there is still a lingering doubt as to the actual number of plastic packets seized, the following evidence by SP2 at p 43 vol 1 of the Record of Appeal removes all traces of such doubt:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Thus, the discrepancy although material is explainable. Contrary to learned counsel's criticism, we find that the learned trial judge's approach in dealing with the identity of the drug exhibits is beyond reproach. He examined the evidence with meticulous care and his mind was clearly focused on making sure that the right drug exhibits were produced in court. He had also sufficiently addressed his mind to the failure by the prosecution to produce the blue carbon papers and he concluded that the failure did not affect the quantity nor the nature of the drugs as each of the packets was intact and had been properly marked. On the evidence no valid criticism can be leveled against the learned judge for arriving at such finding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As for the existence of the brown tapes, the appellant's complaint is that no explanation was given as to where the tapes came from and for what purpose they were wrapped around the plastic packets. This according to learned counsel raises the possibility that the drug exhibits had been tempered with, especially in the light of evidence that the Investigating Officer only sent the exhibits to the chemist 12 days after receiving them from SP2.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Counsel went so far as to suggest that the purpose was to hide defects in the plastic packets. Learned counsel was in effect suggesting that the police had manipulated the evidence for an ulterior purpose. With due respect to the learned counsel there is no evidential basis for drawing such adverse inference. In the first place the suggestion was not even put to any of the prosecution witnesses. A grave suggestion such as this should never be made without basis and without giving the witnesses any opportunity to explain. As every lawyer should know by hard, a mere possibility does not turn fiction into fact.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> As for ourselves we are of the view that even without the blue carbon papers and the failure to explain how the brown tapes came to be wrapped around the plastic packets, the chain of evidence relating to the drug exhibits remained intact. In this respect we note that the prosecution witnesses involved in handling the exhibits were not seriously challenged on their identification of the drug exhibits. The only challenge to SP2's evidence was by way of the following 'put' questions, which SP2 denied:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Even then the two 'put' questions were not even consistent and in fact contradictory. On the one hand it was put to SP2 that not all the exhibits seized were produced in court, meaning to say only some of the exhibits were produced. On the other hand it was put to him that all of the exhibits produced in court were not the exhibits seized.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As for the Investigating Officer (SP6), the crucial part of his evidence is that after receiving the exhibits from SP2, he marked the 16 plastic packets with the markings P35A to P35H and P36A to P36H and the eight twin packets with the markings RB1 to RB8. The only challenge to SP6's evidence on this point is the following 'put' question, which SP6 categorically denied:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Again it was a suggestion that all (and not only some) of the exhibits produced in court were not the exhibits seized. There was however no challenge to the markings that SP6 made, nor his positive identification of the markings in court. As for the chemist (SP5), the only challenge to his evidence is that the weighing machine that he used to weigh the drugs was not calibrated and that his Chemist Report was neither complete nor conclusive. When both suggestions were denied by SP5, counsel did not pursue the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> SP5's testimony that the crystalline substances that he examined were the exhibits that the Investigating Officer handed over to him was not challenged at all. Consequently the appellant is deemed to have accepted SP5's evidence that the substances that he examined and found to contain 1,488 grams of methamphetamine were the same exhibits that the Investigating Officer handed over to him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Challenging the testimony of a witness by way of cross examination is an integral and essential part of our adversarial system of justice. It serves two main purposes:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> To have any real bite the challenge must not only be directed at specific particulars of the witness's testimony but must relate to facts which the witness had a part in or which he has personal knowledge of. It is futile for instance to put to the witness the question, "I put it to you that at Kampala Airport, Uganda the bag was passed to the accused by Idi Amin" when there is no basis whatsoever to impute knowledge of such fact to the witness. This is a matter within the special knowledge of the accused and thus for himself to establish in his defence, if called. It is not for the witness to answer such question.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> It is true that failure on the part of the accused to put his case to the relevant witnesses can never, by itself, relieve the prosecution of its duty of establishing the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_47;"><i>Alcontara Ambross Anthony v. PP</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 47</LINK>; [1996] 1 MLJ 209; [1996] 1 CLJ 705; [1996] 1 AMR 817 per Edgar Joseph Jr FCJ. But such failure also means that the testimony given could not be disputed at all: see <i>AEG Carapiet v. Derderian</i> [1961] AIR Cal 359.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It was also submitted that there is a discrepancy in the prosecution evidence on the gross weight of the drugs. It was pointed out that three different witnesses gave three different gross weights. SP2 said it was 2,000 grams, SP6 said it was 2,060 grams while the chemist (SP5) said it was 2,067 grams and there was no explanation for the discrepancy. It was strenuously argued that this gives rise to a serious doubt on the identity of the drug exhibits, citing <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_798;"><i>Yusri Pialmi v. PP</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 798</LINK>; [2010] 3 MLJ 445; [2010] 6 CLJ 878 and the cases cited therein.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In our view the discrepancy is again explainable. SP2's testimony is that he used an uncalibrated weighing machine to weigh the drugs. This accounts for the difference of 67 grams in weight of the drugs. SP6 used a digital but uncalibrated weighing scale whereas SP5 used a digital and calibrated weighing scale which resulted in a difference of only 7 grams. Surely we do not expect the weights to be accurate to the last decimal point.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> Therefore the discrepancy in the gross weight of the drugs cannot be considered such a serious discrepancy as to cast a serious doubt on the identity of the exhibits. What is important is whether the right exhibits had been produced in court. This is purely a question of fact and the learned trial judge was satisfied that the exhibits produced in court were the same exhibits seized by SP2 from the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> In any case we cannot expect the initial weighing by the police to be as accurate as that done by the chemist: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_2_180;"><i>Gunalan Ramachandran &amp; Ors v. PP</i> [2004] 2 MLRA 180</LINK>; [2004] 4 MLJ 489; [2004] 4 CLJ 551; [2004] 6 AMR 189. Even if there had been no explanation for the discrepancy, the conviction can still be affirmed if there was no break in the chain of evidence or a doubt as to the identity of the drugs seized: see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_6_1;"><i>Hasbala Mohd Sarong v. PP</i> [2013] 6 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2013] 6 MLJ 636; [2013] 6 CLJ 945; [2013] 6 AMR 324.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In this regard the learned trial judge had seriously considered whether there was a break in the chain of evidence relating to the drug exhibits and he was satisfied that there was none. This is a finding of fact which we are loathe to interfere with unless the finding is plainly wrong. On the evidence before him the learned trial judge was perfectly entitled to arrive at such finding. We reproduce below what the learned trial judge said at p 31 of his judgment:</p>

      <b>[33]</b> A major criticism was also directed at the alleged discrepancy between the oral testimony of SP5 and his Chemist Report (P33). This is an indirect attack on the credibility of the prosecution's case on the identity of the drug exhibits although premised on the alleged wrong procedure adopted by the chemist in carrying out his analysis. In his report SP5 had stated as follows:</p>

      <b>[34]</b> In his oral evidence in court this is what he said:</p>

      <b>[35]</b> Counsel's submission on this point is as follows:</p>

      <b>[36]</b> We must confess we are unable to understand what the complaint is all about. The testimony of SP5 is that after homogenizing the crystalline substances he carried out the three tests on three different dates. It was not his evidence that he carried out the three tests on the same date that he homogenised the crystalline substances, ie on 7 April 2011. What is clear from both his oral evidence and his Chemist Report is that the substances had already been homogenised at the time he carried out the analysis. This is what he meant when he said "Bahan tersebut telah dijadikan serbuk yang homogen semasa dianalisis" (The substances had been homogenised at the time of the analysis). Clearly SP5 did not say that the homogenization was done at the same time that he carried out the three tests. There is therefore no substance in the point raised by counsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> For all the reasons aforesaid it is our finding that the learned judge had not erred in finding that the identity of the drug exhibits had been proved. Since the identity of the exhibits was the sole issue raised by the appellant in this appeal, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence.</p>
