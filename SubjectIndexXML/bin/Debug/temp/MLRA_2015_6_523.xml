    <p>This was the appellants/interveners' appeal against the decision of the High Court in which the Judicial Commissioner ('JC') allowed a declaration sought by the respondent ('the insurer') pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the Road Transport Act 1987 ('RTA')</LINK> that the insurance policy ('the policy') issued in respect of a motor vehicle registered in the name of the insured was void and unenforceable in regards to the road accident which involved a motorcycle where the interveners were rider and pillion rider of the said motorcycle and dismissed the interveners' objection that the insurer's application was filed out of time. The interveners had filed a suit claiming damages for injuries due to the said accident ('the said suit'), which was still pending. Here, the insurer's application pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the RTA</LINK> was premised on the ground that the insured in the said suit failed to disclose the sale of the car to the new owner, which therefore amounted to a non-disclosure of a material fact and entitled it to avoid the policy issued to the insured. In this appeal, the main issues for determination were, <i>inter alia</i>, when in point of time could an insurance company commence an action under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the RTA</LINK> to declare a policy issued to an insured in respect of an insured vehicle void or unenforceable; and whether the third party (the interveners) would have any remedy where a policy was cancelled or repudiated pursuant to the circumstances provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">96(3)</LINK> of the RTA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (unanimously dismissing the appeal with no order as to costs and affirming the decision of the High Court):</p>
    <p>Per Lim Yee Lan JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In light of the compulsory third party insurance scheme as proscribed in Part IV of the RTA, while the obligation of an insurer to indemnify an insured against any third party claim in any negligence suit involving the insured vehicle was a contractual obligation based on the terms of the policy issued, an insurer's obligation to satisfy a judgment sum obtained by a third party for bodily injuries or death caused by or arising from the use of an insured vehicle was founded on statute. Based on the case of <i>Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Co Berhad v. Kamacheh Karuppen</i>, an insurer could avoid its payment obligation to the third party in respect of any judgment obtained against an insured owner under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) of the RTA</LINK>, only under the circumstances and conditions as provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2)(a), (b), (c) and (3)</LINK>. Here, the circumstances described under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2)(c)</LINK> was different from the circumstances specified in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK>, <i>viz</i>, while <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2)(c)</LINK> used the words "if before the happening of the event which was the cause of the death or bodily injury giving rise to the liability", <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> used the words "before the date the liability was incurred". Therefore, the choice of words was intentional and was meant to cover two different circumstances under which an insurer could repudiate its liability under a policy. (paras 17, 18, 21, 22 &amp; 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">Section 96(2) of the RTA</LINK> was meant to cover a situation where before the happening of the accident which was the cause of the death or bodily injury giving rise to the liability, the policy had been cancelled by mutual consent between the insured and the insurer accompanied by the surrender of the certificate of insurance. On the other hand, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> was intended to cover a situation in which the accident which was the cause of the death or bodily injury giving rise to the liability covered by the terms of policy had already occurred but before any judgment was pronounced by the court in the proceeding commenced by the third party to claim damages against the driver and insured owner in respect of such bodily injuries and or death. Hence, the JC was right when she dismissed the objection of the interveners that the insurer's application for a declaration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> was out of time. (paras 23-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Based on the provisions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91 of the RTA</LINK>, it was clear that a third party who obtained judgment against an uninsured driver and or registered owner of a vehicle by virtue of its cancellation or repudiation by the insurer could look to the Motor Insurers' Bureau for satisfaction of the judgment sum, although, not to the full extent but in practice up to 75% of the judgment sum. (para 38)</p>
    <p>Per Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It is trite that the declaratory reliefs are discretionary reliefs. If the court finds it will be unjust on the facts and circumstances to grant the declaration it may refuse the declaration. There must be material before the court to refuse the declaration. In this instance, a declaration could be obtained before the judgment in the negligence suit. However, the affidavit of the interveners did not demonstrate any fact relevant to the question of prejudice or that it would be unjust to grant a declaration at this stage, save that the deponent only complained of delay and not prejudice to sustain the third party claim in consequence of delay which could not be compensated by costs by the insurer in respect of the delay. (paras 51-52)</p>
    <p>Per Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Upon a perusal of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) of the RTA</LINK>, the words "judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under para <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">91(1)(b)</LINK> (being a liability covered by the terms of the policy) is given against any person insured by the policy" supported the proposition that the words "if before the date the liability was incurred" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the RTA</LINK> must mean that the insurer was entitled to obtain a declaration from court that its policy was void and/ or unenforceable before judgment was entered against the insurer, ie when liability would be incurred by the insurer. (paras 69-70)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The liability of the insured only arose when judgment was obtained against the insured. Therefore, how can it be said that liability arose immediately upon issuance of a policy when the purpose of the same was to cover a third party claim against the insured when and only when judgment was entered against the insured. Accordingly, obtaining of the judgment was a condition precedent to liability and thus, the words should be interpreted to read that the insurer in this case was entitled to make the application to declare the policy void and unenforceable before judgment was entered against the insured.

      <b>Lim Yee Lan JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants/interveners' appeal is against the decision of the Kuala Lumpur High Court made on 7 August 2014 in which the learned Judicial Commissioner (JC) had allowed a declaration sought by the respondent ("the insurer") vide an Originating Summons (OS) pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the Road Transport Act 1987</LINK> that the policy No: 12 MVL074908, effective from the period November 2012 to November 2013, issued in respect of a motor vehicle bearing registration No: WHH 4039 ("insured vehicle") registered in the name of one Imtinan Muhammad Sultan ("the insured") was void and unenforceable in so far as the road accident which occurred on 22 January 2013 which involved motorcycle No: WUT 8370 and the insured vehicle and that the respondent was not liable for any order relating to the plaintiff's suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The interveners were the plaintiffs in suit No: A53KJ-379-12-2013 filed at the Bangi Sessions Court in which the plaintiffs, rider and pillion rider of motorcycle WUT 8370, claimed damages for injuries sustained in a road accident involving the said motorcycle and the insured vehicle. The suit was against one Danial as the driver of the insured vehicle and Imtinan Muhamad Sultan as the registered owner of the insured vehicle ("the defendants").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Initially, the respondent had directed a solicitor to defend the defendants in the suit. During the course of the trial, the respondent discovered that the insured vehicle had been sold to another person by the name of Abdul Razak bin Yaacop ("new owner") and the driver ("Danial") was his son. The facts showed that although the sale of the insured vehicle took place before the date of the accident, the change in ownership was never registered with the Road Transport Department due to some spelling mistake in the name of the insured as it appears in his passport and in the record of the RTD and he remained the registered owner of the car. The new owner had been renewing the Policy in the name of the insured, Imtinan Muhamad Sultan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondent then discharged the solicitor and filed the present OS to declare the policy void and unenforceable in so far as the road accident which occurred on 22 January 2013 and that the respondent was not liable for any order relating to the plaintiff's suit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondent's application was premised on the ground that the failure of the insured (2nd defendant in the Bangi suit) to disclose the sale of the car to the new owner (Danial's father) was a nondisclosure of a material fact which entitled it to avoid the policy issued to the insured.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The plaintiffs applied to intervene in the OS and were allowed by the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The plaintiffs/interveners opposed the OS on the ground that the respondent's application to cancel the policy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> was out of time. It was argued that the phrase "the date the liability was incurred" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> must be interpreted as requiring an application under that subsection to be made before the date of accident. It cannot be applied after the accident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Since the application in this case was made after the accident, it could not be maintained and must be dismissed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> After hearing the parties, the learned JC dismissed the plaintiffs/interveners' objection and granted the declaration sought by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In her judgment, the learned JC gave the following reasons for her decision:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court the interveners/plaintiffs appealed to this court, hence this appeal before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> To our minds, the issue raised in this appeal boils down to this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> This question turns on the meanings to be given to the phrase "before the date the liability was incurred" found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> As the issue involves an interpretation of a specific provision in a statute, in this case <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">subsection 96(3) of the RTA (hereinafter "the Act"</LINK>) it is imperative for the court, when considering the meaning of certain words used in that section, to look at the whole of the section in order to discover the legislative intent behind that section in general and the subsection in particular.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Now <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 falls under Part IV of the Act</LINK> in which the heading reads "PROVISIONS AGAINST THIRD PARTY RISKS ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF MOTOR VEHICLE". A reading of the preamble to the Act shows that Part IV was enacted to fulfill the object of the Act which is, <i>inter alia</i>, "to make provision for the protection of third parties against risks arising out of the use of motor vehicles".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> A perusal of the various sections (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;88.;;">ss 88</LINK> to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;107.;;">107</LINK>) in Part IV would indicate that they proscribe a compulsory third party insurance scheme which is designed to protect third party road users who may suffer bodily injury or death caused by or as a result of the use of an insured vehicle on the road. To achieve that objective, <i>inter alia</i>, these provisions require the registered owner of a vehicle to take out a policy in respect of the vehicle against third party risks (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;90.;;">s 90</LINK>) only with an authorised insurer defined in the Act (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91</LINK>) and imposes an obligation on the insurer to honour a policy against third party risks issued in respect of the insured driver and insured vehicle, notwithstanding any right it may have against the insured to repudiate any liability covered under the policy (<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1)</LINK>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the light of the compulsory third party insurance scheme as proscribed in Part IV of the RTA, it can be concluded that while the obligation of an insurer to indemnify an insured against any third party claim in any negligence suit involving the insured vehicle is a contractual obligation based on the terms of the policy issued, an insurer's obligation to satisfy a judgment sum obtained by a third party for bodily injuries or death caused by or arising from the use of an insured vehicle is founded on statute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> That this is the position of the law, is succinctly explained by this court in its latest decision in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_3_278;"><i>Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Co Berhad v. Kamacheh Karuppen</i> [2015] 3 MLRA 278</LINK>; [2015] 4 CLJ 54.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In that case, the central issue for determination in the appeal was whether the insurer (appellant in that case) ought to be held liable to pay to the third party (respondent) whose injuries had been caused by the criminal use of the vehicle by the insured. Simply put, whether the use of the insured vehicle would cover the use of the same in a criminal act.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In answering the question in the affirmative, this court sets out the law governing the nature of the obligation of an insurer to a third party under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) of the Act</LINK> in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Based on the decision of this court in <i>Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Co Berhad v. Kamacheh Karuppen</i>, it is now clear that the following are the only circumstances and conditions under which an insurer would be able to avoid its payment obligation to the third party in respect of any judgment obtained against an insured owner under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1)</LINK>, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> One would notice at once from the above narration that the circumstance mentioned in<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;"> s 96(2)(c)</LINK> is different from the circumstance specified in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK>, <i>viz</i>, while <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2)(c)</LINK> uses the words "if before the happening of the event which was the cause of the death or bodily injury giving rise to the liability", <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> uses the words "before the date the liability was incurred".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In our view, the choice of words was intentional and was meant to cover two different circumstances under which an insurer can repudiate its liability under a policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">Section 96(2)</LINK>, in our view, is meant to cover a situation where before the happening of the accident which was the cause of the death or bodily injury giving rise to the liability, the policy has been cancelled by mutual consent between the insured and the insurer accompanied by the surrender of the certificate of insurance, because the words "the event which was the cause of the death" in simple layman terms can only mean "the accident which was the cause of the death".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">Section 96(3)</LINK>, on the other hand, is intended to cover a situation in which the accident which was the cause of the death or bodily injury giving rise to the liability covered by the terms of policy has already occurred but before any judgment is pronounced by the court in the proceeding commenced by the third party to claim damages against the driver and insured owner in respect of such bodily injuries and or death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Hence, the first line of decisions went into error when, without looking at <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96</LINK> as a whole, they had interpreted the words "before the date the liability was incurred" in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> to mean a date before the accident, without realising that the circumstance under which a policy can be cancelled before the accident is already covered under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2)(c)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> In this regard, we agree with and cite with approval the following passage of the judgment in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2013_998;"><i>Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Co Berhad v. Goh Cheng Loong &amp; Ors</i> [2013] MLRHU 998</LINK>, in which Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera JC ( as he then was) sets out correctly the proper interpretation to be given to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Based on the foregoing discussion and findings, we are of the view that the learned JC was right when she, in reliance on the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1855;"><i>Kurnia Insurans (Malaysia) Bhd v. Kein Hing Appliances Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] MLRHU 1855</LINK> (which had since been affirmed by this court although no written judgment has been issued), dismissed the objection of the plaintiffs/interveners that the respondent's application for a declaration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> was out of time on the ground that while a suit had been commenced by the plaintiffs/interveners against the defendants in the Bangi Sessions Court, the case has not been completed and no judgment has been pronounced as yet by the Bangi Sessions Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Be that as it may, we noticed that the one pertinent question which so far escapes the attention of the courts dealing with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96 of the Act</LINK> is, what would happen to a third party where a policy has been cancelled or repudiated pursuant to the circumstances provided in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the Act</LINK>? Would he be left with a paper or empty judgment in the event the driver or registered owner of the vehicle cannot satisfy the judgment sum?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In view of the legislative intent behind Part IV of the Act, which is to provide a compulsory insurance scheme for the protection of a third party against risk arising out of the use of a motor vehicle on the road, the Act ensures that there are adequate provisions to cover these eventualities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> These provisions are found in<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;"> s 91(1)(a) of the Act</LINK>. As stated earlier, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91</LINK> provides that a policy is only effective if it is obtained from an authorised insurer. An "authorised insurer" is in turn defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> as "a person lawfully carrying on motor vehicle insurance business in Malaysia who is a member of the Motor Insurers' Bureau".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The term "Motor Insurers' Bureau" is in turn defined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;2.;;">s 2 of the Act</LINK> as "the Motor Insurers' Bureau which has executed an agreement with the Minister of Transport to secure compensation to third party victims of road accidents in cases where such victims are denied compensation by the absence of insurance or of effective insurance".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> Reading <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91</LINK> together with the definition of "authorised insurer", it would necessarily mean that every insurance company carrying on a motor insurance business in Malaysia is a member of the Motor Insurers' Bureau.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In this regard, the latest memorandum of agreement signed between the Motor Insurers' Bureau and the Minister of Transport is the Memorandum of Agreement dated 1 January 1992 (MOT-MOA). Pursuant to the MOT-MOA, the Motor Insurers' Bureau (Bureau) had in turn entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (Insurers-MOA) of even date between the Bureau and all the insurers of motor vehicle insurance which binds each of the insurers to the Bureau and severally to each and every other of the insurers to perform the MOT-MOA.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Under the Insurers-MOA, every insurance company in Malaysia has agreed in principal to provide insurance coverage in the following situations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Clause 2 of the MOT-MOA provides that the Bureau will consider to make at its absolute discretion, compassionate payments or allowances to persons injured and to the dependents of persons killed in the accident through the use of motor vehicles which do not have in force any policy of insurance as required by Part IV of the RTA or where such a policy is ineffective for any reason other than the inability of the insurer to make payment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Clause 4 of the MOT-MOA allows the Bureau or the insurer (who has paid on behalf of the Bureau) to recover any sum paid under cl 2 of the MOT-MOA against the policy holder or any other person.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Based on the foregoing provisions in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91</LINK>, it is clear that a third party who obtains judgment against an uninsured driver and or registered owner of a vehicle by virtue of its cancellation or repudiation by the insurer can look to the Bureau for satisfaction of the judgment sum, although as we understood it, not to the full extent but in practice up to 75% of the judgment sum.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion And Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Based on the foregoing discussions and findings, our answer to the question raised in this appeal is that under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the Act</LINK>, an insurer can commence an action to repudiate a policy issued in respect of an insured vehicle before any judgment is obtained in the proceeding commenced by a third party for damages for bodily injuries or death sustained in a road accident caused by or arising from the use of the insured vehicle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the appeal with no order as to costs and affirm the decision of the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The appellants/interveners appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge in relation to a declaration by the respondent insurer of the motor vehicle No: WUT 8370 against the insured, Imtinan Muhammad Sultan, the respondent in the originating summon. Despite the interveners' objection to the declaration, the learned High Court Judge had allowed the respondent's prayer for a declaration which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The interveners are the plaintiffs in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2014_577;"><i>Allianz General Insurance Company (Malaysia) Berhad v. Imtinan Muhamad Sultan; Ahmad Nadzrin Abd Halim &amp; Anor (Interveners)</i> [2014] MLRHU 577</LINK>, claiming damages for negligence against vehicle owner Imtinan Mohammad Sultan. The insurer had directed the solicitor to defend the suit and the action has been tried but no judgment has been delivered. During the course of trial, the insurer had discovered that the vehicle had been sold to another person at the time of the accident. To avoid liability, the insurer who is the respondent in this appeal had filed for declaration and was successful.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Upon hearing the submission, we reserved judgment. My learned sister Lim Yee Lan JCA and learned brother Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA have written separate judgments. This is my judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminaries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> The learned trial judge had set out the facts as well as the law in a lucid manner. In concluding the judgment, the learned High Court Judge had relied on the judgment of the High Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1855;"><i>Kurnia Insurans (Malaysia) Bhd v. Kein Hing Appliances Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] MLRHU 1855</LINK>, which is said to have been affirmed by the Court of Appeal but no written grounds are available. Both learned counsel agree there are conflicting decisions of the High Court in relation to the construction of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of Road Transport Act 1987 (RTA 1987)</LINK> and there is no written decision of the Court of Appeal on this issue.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the instant case, it is not in dispute that insurers can seek a declaration to avoid a policy and/or certificate of insurance issued for a motor vehicle under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK>. The issue is when that application should be made, taking into consideration the insurance policy is mandatory to cover third party liability and in that respect, some of the provisions in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;;">RTA 1987</LINK> can be categorised as social legislation to protect road users from the negligence caused by the usage of motor vehicle owned by the assured. The learned High Court Judge had captured this part of the argument in the judgment and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> The respondent had issued a motor policy to the vehicle owner, Imtinan Muhamad Sultan who is said to have sold the vehicle to Abdul Razak bin Yakop. However, the vehicle was not registered at the Road Transport Department due to some technicalities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> Abdul Razak's son, Danial, while driving the vehicle, collided with a motorcycle and injured two persons who are the interveners as well as the appellants in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The interveners had initiated a suit in negligence against Danial as the driver and Imtinan as the motor vehicle owner. The respondent had appointed lawyers to defend Imtinan and also had filed defence. Subsequently, realising that Imtinan had sold the motor vehicle, the insurer had filed the originating summons to avoid liability under the insurance policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Construction And Jurisprudence In Relation To <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">Section 96(3) Of Road Transport Act 1987</LINK></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> It is a mandatory requirement for a motor vehicle owner to obtain an insurance policy to cover third party risks. [See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;90.;;">s 90 RTA 1987</LINK>]. The insurance coverage technically is not for the motor vehicle owner <i>per se</i>, but to cover negligence caused by the use of the motor vehicle by any person. [See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(b) RTA 1987</LINK>]. That is to say, any person can drive the motor vehicle whether it is authorised by the owner or otherwise, but if the vehicle causes damage to third party, the insurers are liable to pay under the policy unless the insurance policy and/or the certificate stated in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91(4) of RTA 1987</LINK> is set aside by the order of court. [See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">s 91 RTA 1987</LINK>].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1)</LINK>, if judgment has been made against the motor vehicle owner, the law requires the insurer to pay to the third party who holds the judgment, notwithstanding the insurer could have avoided or cancelled the policy. The exceptions are spelt out in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">subsections 96(2) and (3) of RTA 1987</LINK>. The said section reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> It is trite that the declaratory relief is discretionary relief. If the court finds it will be unjust on the facts and circumstances to grant the declaration, it may refuse the declaration. There must be material before the court to refuse the declaration.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> I have read the appeal records and the able submission of the learned counsel. After much consideration to the submission of the respondent, I take the view that the appeal must be dismissed. My reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> For reasons stated above, the appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> We hereby order so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Prasad Sandosham Abraham JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> This appeal was heard on 22 January 2015 and we adjourned the matter for decision to a date to be fixed as we were of the view that the appeal raised an important question of law that required our further deliberation. I now deliver my judgment. The facts material to this appeal are now set out below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Facts Germaine To This Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The facts in the present case are not in dispute. The defendant, Imtinan Muhamad Sultan, was the registered owner of the motorcar and had applied for insurance cover for the motorcar from the respondents for the period of 6 November 2012 to 5 November 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The motorcar was involved in an accident on 22 January 2013 with motorcycle bearing registration No: WUT 8370 which was rode by Ahmad Nadzrin Abd Halim ("the rider") with Muhammad Aiman Abd Rahman as his pillion (interveners). The registered owner of the motorcycle was Abd Rahman Sudin. At the time of accident, the motorcar was not driven by the defendant, but one Danial Iskandar Abdul Razak ("Danial").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> Messrs Raj &amp; Co then instituted a civil suit at the Bandar Baru Bangi Sessions Court ("the Bangi action") on behalf of the rider and his pillion against Danial and the defendant to claim for damages for injuries and losses suffered as a result of the accident. The summons and statement of claim averred that Danial was the driver of the motorcar and the defendant was the owner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Following the receipt of the summons and the statement of claim, the respondent appointed adjusters to investigate the claim and engaged solicitors to represent the defendant in the Bangi action. The adjusters had obtained the copies of the police reports made by Danial, the rider, his pillion and Danial's father, Abdul Razak bin Yaacob in respect of the accident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The respondent then discovered that the defendant had sold the motorcar to Danial's father prior to the accident. This information had come from Danial's father who had in his possession the relevant supporting documents to corroborate his statement that he had become the new owner at the material time. According to Danial's father, he had taken the forms executed by the defendant to effect the name change but was unable to do so because the Road Transport Department had made a mistake in the spelling of the defendant's name in their records. It did not tally with the defendant's name as spelt in his Indonesian passport. Danial's father also informed the plaintiffs that the defendant could not be reached thereafter to rectify the mistake in the records of the Road Transport Department and has remained the registered owner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> Danial's father gave a statutory declaration confirming his purchase of the motorcar from the defendant prior to the accident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> On 8 May 2014, the respondent filed the present application to cancel the policy. The application was supported by two affidavits affirmed by Wong Chee Yein and Ratnadevi d/o Irusan. It was averred that the defendant had failed to disclose the sale of the motorcar and this omission entitled the plaintiff to avoid the policy. It was explained that the respondents had mistakenly engaged solicitors to represent the defendant in the Bangi action not knowing that the defendant had no insurable interest in the motorcar at the time of accident, but discharged themselves upon confirming that the latter had sold the motorcar.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The rider and his pillion ("the interveners") applied to intervene in these proceedings and on 2 July 2014 were given leave to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> To decide this question, reference should be made to<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;"> s 96(3) of the Road Transport Act 1987 ("the said Act")</LINK> and in particular <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MMY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) of the said Act</LINK> which sets out the purport of the scheme for persons insured in respect of Third Party risks. And I set out <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1)</LINK><i>in toto</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> In our particular case the respondent had made an application to the High Court to seek a declaration under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) of the said Act</LINK> that the Insurance Policy issued by them was void and/or unenforceable. The ground for that application was that they had been a change in the ownership of the insured vehicle without due notice being given to the applicant (a fact not in dispute).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The appellants in this case do not seriously challenge the right of the respondent to do so. But the argument that they mount before this court is that the respondent is precluded from doing so as the respondent had failed to seek such a declaration before the date of the accident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> This would require an interpretation of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the said Act</LINK> and in particular the words "if before the date the liability was incurred". For purposes of gravity, the whole of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3)</LINK> is set out below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> I have examined the authorities on this subsection which appeared to be divergent, ie a group of cases holding that such a declaration must be made before the date of the accident, and the other view, ie such an application to be made before judgment is entered, a view taken by a learned judge in this present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Having perused all the cases, it is my considered view that the words that I referred to earlier must mean that the respondent is entitled to obtain a declaration from court that its policy was void and/or unenforceable before judgment was entered against the respondent which in our view is when liability will be incurred by the respondent. If <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(1) of the said Act</LINK> is looked at, particularly the words "judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under para <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;91.;;">91(1)(b)</LINK> (being a liability covered by the terms of the policy) is given against any person insured by the policy" supports that proposition. In our present case the learned judge followed <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2012_1855;"><i>Kurnia Insurans (Malaysia) Bhd v. Kein Hing Appliances Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] MLRHU 1855</LINK> and the judgment of Her Ladyship Hadhariah J whose reasoning, I agree with. This particular case went on appeal to this court and the judgment was upheld. Hadhariah J explained:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> I am also in agreement by the views express by His Lordship Justice Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRHU_2013_998;"><i>Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Co Berhad v. Goh Cheng Loong &amp; Ors</i> [2013] MLRHU 998</LINK> an unreported decision and to the judgment at p 5 and I quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Again the reasoning with which I agree with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> Another instructive case in my view which sheds light on this question of interpretation of these words is the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1980_1_199;"><i>QBE Insurance Ltd v. Hashim Bin Abdul &amp; Anor</i> [1980] 1 MLRA 199</LINK>; [1981] 2 MLJ 275 and to the judgment of Syed Agil Barakbah J (as he then was). Before I proceed to deal with this case I wish to place a rider that the case deals with the precursor to the current said Act, ie Road Traffic Ordinance 1958. But we are of the view that the principle of interpretation remains the same. It was held by Justice Syed Agil Barakbah (as he then was) that liability is incurred only when judgment in respect of liability as covered by the terms of the said insurance policy is given against the insured and we quote from the judgment at pp 200-201:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The liability of the defendant (insured) only arises when judgment is obtained against the defendant (insured). In the case cited s 80(1) of English Road Traffic Ordinance 1958 is similar in terms to the said Act. How can it be said that liability arises immediately upon issuance of a policy when the purpose of the same was to cover a third party claim against the defendant (insured) when and only when judgment is entered against the defendant (insured). So it follows as alluded to in the cases cited, that obtainment of the judgment is a condition precedent to liability and therefore the words should be interpreted to read that the respondent was entitled to make the application to declare the Insurance Policy void and unenforceable before judgment was entered against the defendant (insured).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> I also find that the respondent had complied with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_333;96.;;">s 96(3) of the said Act</LINK> and the proviso to the same. In the light of that, the appeal of the appellants in this appeal is dismissed with no order to costs.</p>
