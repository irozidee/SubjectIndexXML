    <p>The appellant and two others were charged under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code ("Code")</LINK> for the murder of the victim. The victim had suffered a slash at the neck due to a sharp object, that severed his carotid artery. At the close of the prosecution's case, the charges against the two others were reduced to charges under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;323.;;">s 323 of the Code</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34</LINK> of the same. The two others pleaded guilty to the reduced charges. However, the appellant was called to enter his defence to murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Code</LINK>. In his defence, the appellant raised grave and sudden provocation. The appellant claimed that the victim had punched him and in retaliation he had swung a chopper towards the victim intending only to scare him, but hit him instead. The High Court rejected the defence, convicted him on the charge and sentenced him to death. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> At the trial, a lot of judicial time was spent on identifying the deceased victim due to the absence of any identification document relating to the deceased victim. This was unnecessary since there was already sufficient evidence on record. The deceased victim was seen by PW17 at the scene and had been identified as a friend by another witness at the post-mortem to the doctor conducting the post-mortem, in the presence of PW17. (para 52)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The Judicial Commissioner had arrived at the correct decision when at the conclusion of the prosecution's case, His Lordship found that a <i>prima facie </i>case had been established and called upon the appellant to enter his defence. (para 57)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the evidence showed that the appellant was in a far superior position as compared to the deceased victim. His claim that he had swung the chopper to scare the victim and had accidentally slashed the victim's neck was certainly not reasonable. (para 70)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The appellant did not claim that he had reacted to a grave and sudden provocation, even if it could be said that the two blows from the victim were grave and sudden. His claim was that in trying "to scare" the victim, he had accidentally slashed the victim. The acts of the victim and his own statement that he was merely trying to scare the victim clearly showed that the appellant was not a man "deprived of the power of self control by grave and sudden provocation". The appellant therefore was not entitled to the benefit of Exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The Judicial Commissioner was correct when His Lordship found that the appellant had failed to make out a defence of grave and sudden provocation or to show that the slashing of the victim happened accidentally.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Zaharah Ibrahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was the appellant's appeal against the decision of the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at Kuching, Sarawak, which convicted the appellant of the charge against him for the offence of murder under s 302 of the Penal Code. The appellant was sentenced to death and ordered to be hung by the neck until he is dead.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant (the 1st accused in the court below) was charged with two others (the 2nd accused and the 3rd accused) for an offence under s 302 of the Penal Code read with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Code</LINK>. However, at the close of the prosecution's case, the charge against the 2nd accused and the 3rd accused was reduced to one for an offence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;323.;;">s 323 of the Penal Code</LINK> read together with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;34.;;">s 34 of the Code</LINK>. They pleaded guilty. There is no appeal before us either by or against the 2nd accused or the 3rd accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant will be referred to in this judgment as the "accused".</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Charge</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The charge against the accused (and the other accused persons) was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We found no record of the charge being amended at the close of the prosecution's case after the charge against the two other accused persons was amended. But this was not raised as an issue before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Trial</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The trial was presided over by His Lordship Sangau Gunting J until the completion of PW22's evidence. His Lordship John Ko Wai Seng, JC, then presided over the trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Evidence Adduced For The Prosecution</b>
    </p>
    <p>[<b>7]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner had set out with great detail in his judgment the evidence adduced during the case for the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The account of what transpired in the incident that resulted in the death of the deceased came from the evidence given by Rafaee bin Baki (PW7) and Mohammad Barkat Khan (PW8).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> PW7 testified that about 3pm on 18 November 2007, he was with PW8 at the fish market in Pasar Utama Bintulu, having alcoholic drinks.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The deceased arrived later at the same location, accompanied by two girls, who were the deceased's adopted sisters. The girls were later identified as Nizar Robina Ak Guandi and Jessica Ak Galang.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The deceased joined PW7 and PW8 in their drinking session.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The deceased then started to disturb passers-by by pushing the men and touching the girls. PW7 said he advised the deceased not to do that but was ignored by the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The deceased and his two adopted sisters then went away.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The accused, whom PW7 said was a friend of his, came to join PW7 and PW8.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> After the accused came to join PW7 and PW8, the deceased came back and continued to disturb passers-by.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The accused was not happy with the deceased's conduct and had an argument with the deceased over it. The accused wanted to punch the deceased but PW7 managed to stop the argument.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The accused then walked towards the pork market.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The deceased followed the accused and punched the accused from behind, causing the accused to fall down. The deceased then chased after the accused. However, PW7 was unsure the direction in which the accused and the deceased went.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The deceased then came back to where PW7 was.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> According to PW8, after the accused had fallen down after being punched, the accused had stood up and ran in the direction of the fish and pork market. PW8 went in the same direction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> When PW8 reached the public toilet at the fish market, he saw that the accused was holding a chopper that was usually used to cut up pork.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> PW8 ran back to where PW7 was and informed him that the accused was coming towards the place where they were with a chopper. PW8 took a broomstick whilst the others (including the deceased) looked for things to defend themselves from the accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> PW8 said he saw the deceased picked up a metal drain cover but had to let it go due to its weight. As he (the deceased) was unable to find any other item to defend himself, the deceased ran away.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The accused warned PW8 and the others not to interfere as it was the deceased that he was looking for.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> According to PW7, the accused, now joined by his younger brother (the 2nd accused) and his uncle (the 3rd accused) chased the deceased towards the Esplanade, and until the flower beds at the edge of the Esplanade.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The deceased attempted to turn back near the SESCO substation but the 2nd accused and the 3rd accused blocked his way and the deceased fell down.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> PW7 said he saw one of the three accused persons (but he was unsure which of the three) slashed the deceased once with the chopper. PW7 said the two adopted sisters of the deceased ran away after the deceased was slashed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> PW8 testified that he saw the accused swung the chopper once towards the back left neck of the deceased. The accused and the other two accused persons then left the deceased and walked towards the pork market, with the accused still holding the chopper.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> PW8 said that when he (PW8) was leaving the scene, he saw the accused threw the chopper towards the drain but it did not fall into the drain. The other two accused persons then picked up the chopper and walked towards the pork market until they were all out of PW8's sight.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> A call from a member of the public was received by Corporal Mohamed Johari (PW1) at the Bintulu Central Police Station about 3.15pm about the incident. The Investigating Officer, Inspector Jasminus bin Sidik (PW17) was duly informed and he went to the scene about 3.25pm and saw a lot of people gathered at the scene and the deceased lying motionless.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> An ambulance was summoned but the ambulance personnel declared that the deceased had died. The deceased was subsequently taken to the mortuary at the Bintulu Hospital by PW17 and his men in a police land rover.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> A post-mortem was conducted on 29 November 2007 on the body of the deceased by Dr Jamil bin Dolkadir (PW14), the Consultant Pathologist and Head of the Pathology Department of the Sarawak General Hospital in Kuching. According to PW14, the cause of death of the deceased was "deep, large cut wound at left neck cutting carotid vessel due to sharp object". This injury was fatal in nature. The deceased had a very slim chance of survival.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision At The Conclusion Of The Case For The Prosecution</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the learned Judicial Commissioner found that the prosecution had proved a <i>prima facie </i>case against the accused and the accused was called upon to enter on his defence on the charge against him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Defence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The accused chose to give evidence under affirmation ("on oath").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> According to the accused, on the day in question he was drinking with his friends at Li Hua Plaza, having been invited to go there by one of his friends while he was drinking at a stall at the market. They then went back to the fish market. At the fish market, he and his friends went their separate ways.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The accused then went to have some food at the coffee shop across the fish market. He then went back to that part of the market where poultry and pork were sold to meet his uncle who worked at the pork stall at the market. From there he wanted to use the back lane to go home.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> When the accused reached the back of the fish market, however, he was punched in the face by someone who suddenly came out in front of him. The accused asked the man for the reason he was punched, and was told that it was because the accused had quarrelled with the man's friend.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The unknown man punched the accused again for a second time and the accused fell down.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The accused then got up and ran to the pork stall where his brother was because he saw that the man had grabbed an "iron rod" near the drain and was chasing him. The accused was shown a photograph of a metal drain cover and identified that as the "iron rod" meant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> During cross-examination, the accused admitted that when he was chasing the man, the man was no longer holding the metal drain cover. The man had thrown away the metal drain cover by then.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The accused took a chopper from the pork stall and chased after the man who punched him. The man tripped and fell on his back.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> According to the accused he swung the chopper towards the ground beside the man to scare him but the man turned at the same time, and as he turned the chopper hit him on the neck.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> The accused said he then went back to the pork stall and went home.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision At The Conclusion Of The Trial</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> At the end of the whole case, the learned Judicial Commissioner concluded that the prosecution had proved the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and convicted him of that charge. He was sentenced to death as provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> Before us, the learned counsel for the accused submitted that there was grave and sudden provocation and submitted that the charge should be reduced accordingly.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> According to the learned counsel for the accused, the learned Judicial Commissioner erred in finding that the initial provocation by the deceased had lost its sting when the evidence of PW7 was that from the time of the punch by the deceased until the time the accused came back with the chopper, less than three minutes had passed. This short period of time, it was submitted, showed that there was no cooling off.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The learned counsel for the accused also raised the following matters:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> In reply, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor submitted that there was no grave and sudden provocation. The act of the accused was disproportionate to being punched by the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> On the omission of the opening statement from the Record of Appeal, the learned deputy submitted that as this was tendered in the High Court, it did not prejudice the accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> As for the error in the number of witnesses, the learned deputy submitted that it was also not prejudicial to the accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Analysis Of The High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Conclusion Of The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Death Of Isa Ak Jawing</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner found that the prosecution had proved that the person found at the place as stated in the charge had died and the deceased was sufficiently identified as Isa Ak Jawing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We noted that a lot of judicial time was spent in the identification of the deceased person due to the absence of any identification document in relation to the deceased. This, in our view, was quite unnecessary as there was already sufficient evidence that the deceased was the person seen by PW17 at the scene and identified at the post-mortem by one Nizar Robina Ak Guandi to the doctor conducting the post mortem (PW14) as her friend, in PW17's presence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The identity of the deceased and the fact of his death were not raised as issues before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Cause Of Death</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> The cause of death as given by PW14 was also not an issue before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Intention To Inflict The Injury That Caused Death</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner had considered, in particular, the evidence of PW14 and concluded that the injury was such that it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to case the death of the deceased. This was not an issue before us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Injury Was Caused By The Accused</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> Based on the evidence of PW7 and PW8 and the statement recorded from Jessica Ak Galang (which statement was admitted into evidence under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;32.;;">s 32 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>), the learned Judicial Commissioner found that the prosecution had proved that it was the accused who had inflicted the fatal injury on the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Finding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We were therefore satisfied that the learned Judicial Commissioner arrived at the correct decision when His Lordship found, at the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, that a <i>prima facie </i>case had been proved, and when he called upon the accused to enter on his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The Conclusion Of The Whole Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> The accused's defence was that he was suddenly and gravely provoked by the deceased, and that the slashing was accidental.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner analysed the evidence of the accused and that of PW7 and PW8 and concluded that although there was an initial provocation (the two blows with the deceased's fist) there was no evidence of grave and sudden provocation. The deceased was unarmed when he was chased by the accused with a chopper in hand until he (the deceased) fell down on the ground, and then the accused inflicted the fatal slash on the deceased's neck.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner dealt at length in his judgment with the defence that the injury was inflicted accidentally. His Lordship concluded that the choice of weapon (a chopper), the location (the head area) towards which the accused swung the weapon and the nature of the injury negated his claim of the injury being accidental.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Analysis</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> We have also carefully examined the evidence adduced to determine whether the conclusion reached by the learned Judicial Commissioner was supported by evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Was The Injury To The Deceased Caused Accidentally?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The accused said in his evidence that from the time he met the deceased until the time the deceased was "chopped" around 5 minutes had lapsed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> According to the accused, in the course of being chased by the accused and the 2nd and the 3rd accused persons, the deceased had tripped and fallen to the ground about eight feet away from the accused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> The accused then went over to where the deceased fell. "Then I swung the chopper to the ground besides the man to scare him but he turned and at the same time as he turned the chopper hit on the neck".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> The evidence was clear that the deceased was running away from the accused who had a chopper in his hand.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The accused admitted during cross-examination that when he was chasing the deceased, the deceased was not holding any weapon. The deceased had by then, according to the accused himself, thrown away the metal drain cover.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> The accused also agreed with the suggestion by the Deputy Public Prosecutor that he (the accused) was not alone when he chased after the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> That evidence of the accused confirmed the evidence of PW7 and PW8.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> The accused even agreed with the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor that at the time the accused slashed the deceased, the deceased was lying on the ground, weaponless and defenceless.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> In our view, that evidence showed that the accused was in a far superior position as compared to the deceased. His claim that he swung the chopper to scare the deceased and accidentally slashed the deceased's neck was certainly not reasonable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Was There Grave And Sudden Provocation?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> The provocation that the defence claimed was grave and sudden was the two blows by the deceased using his fist.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> The evidence by PW8 was that he, PW7, the deceased and the others with them took up things to defend themselves with (with the deceased taking up the metal drain cover) AFTER they realised the accused was coming towards them with chopper in hand. The accused on the other hand claimed that he ran to the pork stall and took up the chopper because he saw the deceased grab an "iron rod" near the drain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> The prosecution witnesses testified that the deceased let go of the metal drain cover because it was heavy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> The accused on the other hand testified that the deceased took the metal drain cover and chased the accused to the pork stall with the metal drain cover.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> As we have mentioned above, the accused admitted that when he was chasing the deceased, the deceased had thrown away the metal drain cover.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> PW8 said that the deceased threw away the metal drain cover as it was heavy. The deceased was looking for wood to defend himself against the approaching accused but was not in time to find one before the accused arrived and started chasing the deceased. PW8 was not cross-examined on this. There was no suggestion put to PW8 that the deceased was chasing after the accused while holding the metal drain cover.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> PW8's evidence that the deceased merely picked up the drain cover and let it go again must therefore be true. The deceased could not then be chasing the accused with the metal drain cover.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b> The accused did not immediately retaliate when he was punched. He instead ran towards the pork stall and picked up a chopper there. He chased after the deceased. The accused's evidence on this point during his examination-in-chief was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> The accused clearly was not claiming that he reacted to a grave and sudden provocation, even if it could be said that the two blows from the deceased were grave and sudden. His claim was that in trying "to scare" the deceased he accidentally slashed the deceased. We have addressed the accidental slashing issue above.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> The accused chased the deceased and then when the deceased had fallen down, he deliberately went over to the deceased from a position eight feet away from the fallen deceased and swung the chopper at the deceased "to scare" the deceased.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> Those acts of the deceased and his own statement that he was merely trying to scare the deceased clearly showed that the accused was NOT a man "deprived of the power of self control by grave and sudden provocation". In our considered view, the accused therefore was not entitled to the benefit of Exception 1 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Finding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> We were satisfied that the learned Judicial Commissioner was correct when His Lordship found that the accused had failed to make out a defence of grave and sudden provocation or to show that the slashing of the deceased happened accidentally.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> We therefore dismissed the appeal by the appellant and affirmed his conviction and sentence.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
