    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The plaintiff filed six defamation actions against the defendant in 2006 ("the 2006 suits") and another six against the defendants in 2007 ("the 2007 suits"). The plaintiff later withdrew three 2006 suits and two 2007 suits. The actions were based on the publication of several letters of complaint and a police report lodged against the plaintiff. At the conclusion of the trial, the High Court allowed all the plaintiff's remaining 2007 suits and dismissed the remaining 2006 suits. The defendants thus appealed against the suits allowed in favour of the plaintiff whereas the plaintiff appealed against the dismissal of the 2006 suits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the defendants' appeal in part concerning the 2007 suits; dismissing the plaintiff's appeals concerning the award of damages; and dismissing the plaintiff's appeals against the dismissal of the 2006 suits with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> With regard to the 2007 actions, whether or not the impugned letters were defamatory of the plaintiff were findings of fact made by the trial court. An appellate court is slow to disturb findings of fact made by the trial court. In the instant case, concerning the 2007 actions, the appellate court did not find any perverse findings of fact made by the trial court in relation to the impugned letters. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's findings of fact. (para 56)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The award ordered, whether for general, exemplary and aggravated damages, was not excessive or inadequate. This court would thus affirm the award of damages and dismiss the cross-appeals by the plaintiff concerning the damages awarded. However, the trial court had erred in awarding interest on the sums and the appellate court would thus set aside the order made concerning interest on the awards. (paras 57-58)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Concerning the dismissal of the plaintiff's 2006 suits, the trial court did not err in its findings of fact. The plaintiff had failed to discharge his burden of proof on the balance of probabilities and the trial court was correct in dismissing the plaintiff's claims against the defendants with costs.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Umi Kalthum Abdul Majid JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> For ease of reference, the parties will be referred to as in the court below, unless the context otherwise requires.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The plaintiff, Datuk Chong Tho Chin, filed six separate actions for defamation against the defendants alleging that the defendants had caused the publication of five separate letters of complaint and a police report which was lodged by Dato' Low Bin Tick ("LBT"). The six civil suits are KLHC S-23-101- 2006, KLHC S6-23-100-2006, KLHC S3-23-90-2006, KLHC S3-23-97-2006, KLHC S5-23-99-2006 and KLHC S-23-126-2006 ("the 2006 Suits/2nd Suit").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In 2007, the plaintiff filed another six defamation suits against the defendant, Dato' Dr Low Bin Tick, at the Kuala Lumpur High Court alleging that the defendant had written and caused the publication of five separate letters of complaint and a police report which in effect had defamed the plaintiff. The suits numbers are KLHC S23-79-2007, KLHC S6-22-709-2007, KLHC S1-23- 141-2007, KLHC S3-23-78-2007, KLHC S7-22-710-2007 and KLHC 23-83- 2007 ("the 2007 Suits/1st Suit"). In KLHC 23-83-2007 suit, the 2nd plaintiff is Yap Hon Kong. On 21 July 2011, the High Court directed that these 2007 Suits be consolidated with the 2006 Suits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On 23 November 2011, the plaintiff withdrew three suits with no order as to costs (S6-23-100-2006, S1-23-141-2007 and S-23-126-2006).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The remaining cases proceeded for trial. However the plaintiff withdrew another two suits (S3-23-97-2006 and S7-22-710-2007) at the conclusion of the trial. The learned Judicial Commissioner (as she then was) ("JC") struck off the two suits with no order as to costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> At the conclusion of the trial, the learned JC allowed all the plaintiff 's claims in S-23-83-2007, S-23-78-2007, S-22-709-2007 and S-23-79-2007 against the defendant. The learned JC further awarded the plaintiff general damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages to be paid by the defendant. The plaintiff 's suits in S1-101-2006, S3-23-90-2006 and S5-23-99-2006 were dismissed with costs to be taxed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeals</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> There are six appeals before us. Four of these appeals are appeals by Dato' Dr Low Bin Tick against the plaintiff in respect of the learned trial judge's decision in suits numbers S-23-79-2007 consolidated with 23-101-2006 (BC case ), S6-22-709-2007 (CCD case), S3-23-78-2007 consolidated with S3-23- 90-2006 (ACA case), and S5-23-99-2006 consolidated with S-23-83-2007 (ROS case). The other two appeals are by the plaintiff against the decision in S3-23- 90-2006 and S5-23-99-2006.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff (Datuk Chong Tho Chin) was the President of Chinwoo Athletic Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur ("Chinwoo") for five terms of two years each totaling 10 years from 30 June 1991 to 24 June 2001.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The defendant in the 2007 Suits (Dato' Low Bin Tick) was the President of the 66th and 67th General Committee ("GC") of Chinwoo from 24 June 2001 to 26 June 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The defendants in the 2006 Suits were the committee members of the 66th and 67th GC of Chinwoo from 24 June 2001 to 26 June 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> At all material times, Chinwoo was the registered owner of a parcel of land known as GRT 2643, Lot 27 Section 69, Bandar Kuala Lumpur located at Jalan San Peng, Kuala Lumpur ("the land").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The facts as gleaned from the defendant's/appellant's written submission are as follows. At an extraordinary general meeting of Chinwoo held on 22 April 1984 ("the April 84 EGM"), the members of Chinwoo resolved to enter into an agreement with a developer, one Jiwa Realty Sdn Bhd ("the developer"), to develop the land.The consideration was for Chinwoo to receive 23% of the various types of building/units and facilities developed and constructed by the developer and a further payment of RM3 million in cash.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Subsequent to the resolution passed at the April 84 EGM, members of Chinwoo decided to revise the proposal of the development of the land. An extraordinary general meeting was held on 28 April 1985 (the "April 85 EGM") at which it was resolved to,<i> inter alia</i>, appoint the developer to design, apply and take charge of all matters related to the development of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Pursuant to and consistent with the resolutions, Chinwoo entered into two agreements with the developer, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Despite execution of the 1985 S&amp;P and the 1986 S&amp;P, the proposed development on the land did not materialise. Joint Venture Revisited In 1990</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> On 15 March 1990, a written report of the Chinwoo Planning Committee ("CPC") was presented to the GC informing that further revised proposal was received from the developer in relation to the development of the land. In this regard, the developer had presented three different scenarios for consideration. The total units to be built as proposed by the developer was 580 units.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Subsequent to the meeting on 15 March 1990, a motion was moved by the members of the CPC on 29 July 1990 at an extraordinary general meeting to consider and approve the development of the land (the "July 90 EGM"). The proposal put to members was that Chinwoo would be entitled to <i>inter alia</i>, 140 units of apartments and a further payment of RM3 million in cash. However, this proposal was rejected.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Subsequent thereto, the issue of the proposed development was again put up by the CPC to the members of Chinwoo at an extraordinary general meeting of Chinwoo held on 30 June 1991 (the "June 1991 EGM").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> At the June 1991 EGM, the members of Chinwoo resolved as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>1992 Agreement - Implementation Of June 1991 EGM Approval</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> By various agreements in writing dated 26 March 1992, drafted and prepared by TC Chong &amp; Rakan-Rakan, Chinwoo through its trustees executed various agreements with the developer to purportedly put into effect the resolution passed in respect of the proposed development at the June 1991 EGM. These agreements consisted of, <i>inter alia</i>, the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> By an Additional Agreement dated 26 March 1992 ("the Additional Agreement"), the trustees of Chinwoo agreed with the developer to add/vary the terms and conditions of the 1992 Land S&amp;P and the 1992 Property S&amp;P.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The plaintiff was, at the material time, the principal partner of TC Chong &amp; Rakan-Rakan. At the same time, the plaintiff was also the President and a trustee of Chinwoo.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Subsequent Development - 'Free Hand' Term Agreed By CPC</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Subsequent to the CPC meeting of 26 November 1991, the plaintiff and various other CPC members had a joint meeting with the developer on the same date. In the said meeting, the plaintiff, in his capacity as the President of Chinwoo, raised some proposed amendments to the development agreements on behalf of Chinwoo. The joint meeting then agreed, inter alia, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> It was after this joint meeting of 26 November 1991 that the Additional Agreement came into being. Prior thereto, there were only two agreements, that is, the 1992 Land S&amp;P and the 1992 Property S&amp;P. The Additional Agreement provided that it was the trustees of Chinwoo who agreed to the free hand term.The minutes showed it was the CPC (including the plaintiff) who agreed to the free hand term.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The terms and conditions as contained in the Deed, the 1992 Land S&amp;P, the 1992 Property S&amp;P and the Additional Agreement were recommended by CPC and later approved by the GC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Members Of Chinwoo Dissatisfied</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Members of Chinwoo contended that the Additional Agreement was inconsistent with the intention of the members of Chinwoo.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The proposed development when completed comprised a total number of 870 units of medium costs apartments (as opposed to the initial proposed total number of units at 669 units). Chinwoo's portion under the Additional Agreement comprised 154 units and 159 car park bays. This was less than 23% of the total development. The developer's entitlement however increased by an extra 201 units from the total development. From the additional 201 units, Chinwoo did not obtain any additional units.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Upon completion of the development of the land, there were members of Chinwoo who were unhappy and/or dissatisfied with the outcome. In this regard:</p>

    <p>
      <b>Plaintiff Lost Presidency</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> On 24 June 2001, the plaintiff lost his bid to be re-elected as President in the election held at the annual general meeting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>June 2003 AGM-Members Resolved To Investigate</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> At an annual general meeting of Chinwoo held on 29 June 2003 (the "June 2003 AGM"), the members of Chinwoo resolved to the effect that the new GC, that is, the 67th GC, be mandated to investigate into the matter of the development of the Chinwoo land and, if any irregularity was found, to get advice from the Association's legal adviser, and contact the relevant departments and authorities and take appropriate action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Establishment Of Independent Committee Of Enquiry</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> Subsequent to the resolution passed at the June 2003 AGM, the GC established an Independent Committee of Enquiry ("the ICE"). A report by the ICE dated 15 September 2004 was delivered to the 67th GC ("the ICE Report"). In this regard, the ICE:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Events Post ICE Report</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> By letter dated 28 December 2004, the defendant/appellant, in his capacity as the President of Chinwoo, sought clarification on the ICE Report from the ICE.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> By letter dated 11 March 2005, the Chairman of the ICE informed the appellant that ICE had completed its duties and was no longer in a position to make any clarification and/or amendment to the said ICE Report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> The ICE Report was made the subject of deliberations of the GC at its meetings on 2 November 2004, 29 March 2005 and 31 May 2005. At its meeting of 2 November 2004, the GC was directed to submit the ICE Report to the Bar Council ("BC"), the Anti-Corruption Agency ("ACA") and the Registrar of Societies ("ROS").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Pursuant to the resolution passed at the June 2003 AGM, the defendant, in his capacity as the President of Chinwoo, lodged the five letters of complaint and a police report on behalf of Chinwoo to the relevant authorities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiff's Legal Action For Defamation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The plaintiff contended that the letters and the police report were defamatory.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The issues arising for determination before the learned JC were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The learned JC held (relating to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd issues) that LBT had failed to obtain legal advice prior to the sending of the complaint letters to the relevant authorities. It was admitted by LBT that he had not received any legal advice from Chinwoo's legal advisors before making any contact with the relevant authorities and department and to take appropriate action. It was decided by the GC Special Meeting on 2 November 2004 that LBT only needed to send the ICE Report to BC, ACA and ROS. Instead LBT had sent the ICE Report to ROS, BC, ACA and CCD. It was never decided in the AGM 2003 and GC Special Meeting on 2 November 2004 that ICE Report should be extended to CCD. As such LBT had exceeded the authority and the mandate given to him at the AGM 2003 by not only sending the ICE Report to CCD but LBT had written a complaint letter to ROS, BC, DB, ACA and CCD. LBT had also lodged a police report dated 13 June 2005.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The learned JC found that LBT had written the complaint ("impugned") letters and had lodged a police report on his own accord. He had admitted that he had sent the impugned letters to CCD, ACA, BC, DB and ROS. There was no special resolution by Chinwoo allowing LBT to send the said letters.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> LBT in his evidence admitted that the committee members of Chinwoo were not involved in his preparation of the complaint letters. That the impugned letters and the police report lodged by LBT were made without the mandate of the committee members. He admitted that the committee members had no knowledge of the contents of the impugned letters and had not participated nor caused the complaints made by LBT be published.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Therefore, the learned JC found that the defendant in the 2006 Suits was not part of the preparation and had not given any mandate to LBT to send the complaint letters and to lodge the police report. They had no knowledge of the contents of the complaint letters before they were sent to BC, CCD, DB, ACA, and ROS.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> In respect of the 2007 Suits (relating to the 4th, 5th and 6th issues), the learned JC held that the words used in the complaint letters referred to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was alleged to be involved in criminal breach of trust, fraud, irregularities and wrongful acts during his tenure as President of Chinwoo. Anybody who read the complaint letters, especially members of Chinwoo, would know that the complaint letters were meant to damage the plaintiff 's reputation in the eyes of the public. Reading the letters in totality and particularly the parts pleaded, the learned JC found that the words used were defamatory to the plaintiff in their natural and ordinary meaning and that they had indeed the tendency to lower the estimation of the plaintiff in the minds of reasonable and right thinking persons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Furthermore LBT admitted that the complaint letters were sent by him personally to the named authorities, namely, ACA, ROS, CCD and BC. Therefore the element of publication was proven by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Having found that LBT had defamed the plaintiff, the learned JC then went on to consider the defenses raised by LBT, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Absolute Privilege</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The learned JC found that as LBT had, in sending the five letters of complaint and lodged the police report without the authority or mandate or resolution at the AGM 2003 and the GC meeting on 2 November 2004, LBT had acted without the authority or mandate of Chinwoo as a society. Therefore LBT could not claim absolute privilege as his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Qualified Privilege</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> LBT had also pleaded in the alternative that he was entitled to the defence of qualified privilege. Reference was made to<i> Adam v. Ward</i> [1917] AC 309 for the proposition of law on qualified privilege, which held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The learned JC found that LBT had failed to prove the privileged occasion mainly due to the fact that the impugned letters and the police report were made without obtaining the necessary authority, resolution from the members of Chinwoo through the 2003 AGM and the GC Meeting of 2 November 2004. The learned JC had found LBT to have mala fide intent in writing those impugned letters and lodging the police report seeing that he did not have the necessary mandate to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Justification</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> On the defence of justification, the learned JC had found that LBT had failed to prove that the allegations in the impugned letters were true. The minutes of the EGM for the year 1991 were correct and had never been denied. SD2 testified that the new formula which was approved at the June 1991 EGM (dated 30 June 1991) was no longer based on 23% of units, but that Chinwoo was to get in return under the new scheme a complete condominium block of their own with 154 units of residential premises, 159 parking bays, swimming pool, separate documents of freehold title and separate access road. The evidence of SD2 was not challenged by the defendant. It was corroborated by the statement of Lim Chee Shin at the meeting of the GC on 7 July 2005 where he confirmed that the new arrangements were approved by the members of Chinwoo at the June 1991 EGM.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The learned JC also found that the defendant had admitted during crossexamination that his allegations against the plaintiff for criminal breach of trust and fraud were based on his own suspicion. LBT had also admitted that there were no minutes in the June 1991 EGM or resolution 1991 which stated that Chinwoo was entitled to 23% of the whole units built under the said project. The learned JC found that LBT had failed to prove that Chinwoo would be entitled to 23% from the total units of condominium built by the developer. The learned JC therefore found LBT had failed to prove his defence of justification.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Abuse Of Process/Multiplicity Of Proceedings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> LBT raised the fact that the plaintiff had filed five civil units, namely, KLHC S2-23-126-2006, S3-23-78-2007, S4-23-79-2007, S4-23-83-2007, and S7-22-710-2007, against him and that this was an abuse of the court's process and or multiplicity of proceedings. <i>Citing Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> at p 142, para 6.2 which states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In the final analysis, the learned JC found that the plaintiffs were successful in proving their claims and that they had suffered damages in respect of their reputation, and therefore they were entitled to damages from the defendant/ LBT.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Damages</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> After considering the relevant authorities, the learned JC awarded damages as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>She also awarded interests on the general damages at 8% per annum beginning from 8 August 2012 to date of settlement of payment, and costs in respect of the said three cases to be taxed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> As for the three 2006 Suits, the learned JC found that the plaintiff had failed to prove his claim against the defendants, and the plaintiff 's claims were dismissed with costs to be taxed.</p>

      <b>[53]</b> These appeals are by the defendant/LBT against the decision of the High Court allowing the claim of the plaintiffs against the defendant.

      <b>Interest</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> On the issue of interest, it was contended by the appellant that the learned JC had erred in awarding the interest of 8% per annum from the date of judgment. It was contented that the learned JC should instead award:</p>

      <b>Yap Hon Kong's (2nd Plaintiff) Claim In The ROS Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The appellant adopted all the submissions laid out against the respondent/ Dato' Chong Tho Chin, to also apply to Yap Hon Kong's claim. It was further submitted that as there was nothing to suggest in Yap Hon Kong's written witness statement and neither did Yap Hon Kong lead any evidence at trial how the alleged defamatory remarks were defamatory of him, there was no prima facie case against the defendant. And therefore it was submitted that Yap Hon Kong's claim ought to be struck out with costs.</p>

      <b>The Decision For Appeals W-02-18-01-2013; W-02-1662-07-2012; W-02- 1700-07-2012 And W-02-1701-07-2012)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> We have read the relevant cause papers, the impugned letters, relevant documents and submissions of the parties pertaining to these appeals. In our view, whether or not the impugned letters are defamatory of the respondents/ Dato' Chong Tho Chin (the 1st plaintiff) and Yap Hon Kong (the 2nd plaintiff) are findings of facts by the learned JC. We are very mindful of the role of appellate courts whereby it is trite law that an appellate court is slow to disturb the findings of facts by the trial court (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_260;"><i>China Airlines Ltd v. Maltran Air Corp Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 260</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 517; [1996] 3 CLJ 163; [1996] 1 AMR 2233. In these appeals, and based on the various authorities cited by the parties, we do not find the learned trial judge as having made any perverse findings of facts in relation to the impugned letters and we do not wish to disturb them. We agree with the learned JC's findings of facts that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> As for damages awarded, the learned JC, having heard the witnesses, was in the best position to weigh the evidence adduced in court and to exercise her discretion judicially to render those award in damages. We do not find the award ordered, may it be for general damages, exemplary and aggravated damages, as being excessive nor inadequate in the given circumstances of the plaintiff/s, the motive of the defendant in sending the impugned letters to the various authorities when he was only mandated to send the ICE Report to them (which did not include to the CCD but which was sent nevertheless) and lodging the police report. We therefore affirm the award of damages and dismiss the cross-appeals by the plaintiff on this aspect.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> We, however, find that the learned JC had erred in awarding the rate of interest on the sums awarded seeing that the law applicable at the time the Orders were made had been amended as per the submission of the appellant/ defendant. We, therefore, set aside the rate of interest of 8% per annum awarded and order that:</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> These appeals are by the plaintiff against the decision of the High Court dismissing the plaintiff 's claim against the defendants/18 members of the 67th GC in their personal capacity in respect of the ROS and ACA suits only. At the trial, the plaintiff/appellant sought to hold the defendants liable for having participated, authorised, acquiesced, caused or ratified the lodgements and publication of the five complaint letters lodged by the President LBT which contained words defamatory of the plaintiff/appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> It was submitted by the plaintiff that the impugned letters and the police report were signed and submitted to the respective authorities by the President of Chinwoo, who was the Chairman of the 67th GC, and who must bear the primary responsibility for the libels in the impugned letters. It was also submitted that the 67th GC members were also liable because on the basis of the available evidence they must be held to have been collectively responsible for the lodgement and publication of the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b> The plaintiffs disagreed with the finding of the learned JC that the GC members than LBT had not authorised and were not liable for the publication of the complaints. Thus these appeals. It was submitted that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> The respondents/defendants in response submitted that it is trite law that the appellate court should be slow in interfering with the findings of fact arrived at by the trial court and cited <i>China Airlines Ltd v. Maltran Air Corp Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal (supra)</i> as their authority. The appellate court would only interfere in circumstances where the trial court has so fundamentally misdirected itself, that one may say that no reasonable court which had properly directed itself and asked the correct questions would have arrived at the same conclusion (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_2_432;"><i>Sivalingam Periasamy v. Periasamy &amp; Anor</i> [1995] 2 MLRA 432</LINK>; [1995] 3 MLJ 395; [1996] 4 CLJ 545; [1996] 3 AMR 3506; and where the decision of the trial court is plainly wrong or unjust (<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_529;"><i>Eng Thye Plantations Bhd v. Lim Heng Hock &amp; Ors</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 529</LINK>; [2001] 4 MLJ 26; [2001] 4 CLJ 245; [2002] 1 AMR 13.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The respondents submitted that the JC did not err in her findings of fact seeing that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> It was further submitted that the appellant had failed to discharge his burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the respondents participated, secured, authorise, caused or ratified the publication of the impugned letters. That the appellant had relied on three instances to say that the respondents had participated in, secured, authorised, acquiesced, caused or ratified the publication of the impugned letters, that is:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, in all these three instances it was about the submission of the ICE Report and not any letters of complaint or police report. The contents or words used in the impugned letters cannot therefore be attributed to the respondents and the appellant cannot equate the submission of the ICE Report to the authorities to the authorship and publication of LBT's letter of complaint.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Decision For Appeals W-02-1716-07-2012; W-02-1719-07-2012</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> We have perused the submissions of both parties, the cause papers, the relevant documents, the grounds of judgment, and once again we are of the view that this court should not intervene in the findings of facts by the learned JC in these appeals. We generally agree with the submissions of the respondent that the learned JC did not err in her findings of fact. Further, the three instances quoted by the appellant, that is, the 2 November 2004, 29 March 2005 and 31 May 2005 GC Meetings, to pin equal blame on the respondents in regard to the impugned letters relate to the submission of the ICE Report to the relevant authorities and not pertaining to the writing of the impugned letters. We therefore agree with the submission of the respondents that the appellant had failed to discharge his burden of proof on the balance of probabilities and that the learned JC was correct in dismissing the appellant's claim against the respondents with costs. We therefore dismiss the appellant's appeals and affirm the Order of the High Court.</p>
