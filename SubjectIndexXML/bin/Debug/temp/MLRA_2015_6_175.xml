    <p>The 1st defendant was the registered owner of certain land ("the land"), charged to the 2nd defendant. On 13 June 2008, the 1st defendant was wound-up ("2008 winding up order") by a third party and a liquidator ("1st liquidator") appointed by the winding up court. On 28 January 2009, the 2nd defendant obtained an order for sale of the land but was injuncted from proceeding with the sale by the plaintiff. The 2nd defendant thereafter agreed to allow the 1st liquidator to sell the land by way of private treaty to the plaintiff. The plaintiff and the 1st liquidator, on the 1st defendant's behalf, entered into a sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") dated 10 September 2009 in respect of the land. The 2nd defendant issued a redemption statement and the plaintiff was to make full payment of the purchase price by 10 December 2009. However on 14 September 2009, a Director and Shareholder of the 1st defendant lodged a caveat which the 1st liquidator failed to remove despite application made to the High Court. The 2nd defendant thus never received the balance purchase price from the plaintiff. On 23 September 2010, the High Court annulled <i>ab initio</i>, the 2008 winding up order and the 1st liquidator was removed from office. Through a creditors' voluntary winding up on 8 February 2011, the 1st defendant was wound up and the 2nd liquidator appointed. On 16 May 2011, the 2nd defendant issued a notice to the 1st liquidator signifying the withdrawal of its consent to the redemption of the land. The plaintiff commenced an action in the High Court for <i>inter alia</i>, specific performance of the SPA and for an order compelling the 2nd defendant to execute and deliver to the plaintiff the discharge of charge and other instruments upon the receipt of the plaintiff's balance purchase price. The High Court: (i) allowed the plaintiff's prayer for specific performance; (ii) held the plaintiff liable to pay later interest payments to the 2nd defendant on the balance purchase price; (iii) ordered the 1st defendant through the 2nd liquidator to execute and deliver to the plaintiff the memorandum of transfer and other necessary instruments of dealings to cause a valid transfer of the land to the plaintiff; and (iv) ordered the 2nd defendant to execute and to deliver to the plaintiff the discharge of charge documents and all other documents required to discharge the charges in favour of the 2nd defendant within seven days of receiving the balance purchase price and late payment interest from the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed and cross-appeals were also filed against the decision concerning the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the plaintiff's appeal but allowing the 1st and 2nd defendants' appeals:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Clause 4.1(c) of the SPA expressly stipulated that in the event the plaintiff failed to pay the full purchase price by the completion date, then the provision on late interest payments would kick in against the plaintiff being the purchaser of the land. This was a contractual obligation for the plaintiff to fulfill. The High Court below was just stating the obvious result of that provision as there was default on the part of the plaintiff to pay the balance sum on the completion date, ie 10 December 2009. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The High Court judge had erred in ordering the 1st defendant, through the 2nd liquidator, to execute and deliver to the plaintiff the memorandum of transfer and other necessary instruments of dealings to cause a valid transfer of the land. The judge erred when she recognised the appointment of the 2nd liquidator after having ruled that the court order dated 23 September 2010 that sought to annul the previous winding up order <i>ab initio</i>, was bad in law. The judge was correct when she had ruled that the subsequent High Court judge could not overrule a valid High Court order that had ordered the winding up of the 1st defendant earlier in 2008, but she had fallen into error when she had proceeded on to rule that the SPA ought to be enforced by way of specific performance against the 1st defendant vide the 2nd liquidator. By doing that she had recognised that the second winding up as valid and that the appointment of the 2nd liquidator competent. The judge was plainly wrong and the order of specific performance against the 1st defendant ought not to be allowed to stand. (paras 14-16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The 2nd defendant was not privy to the SPA between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. The doctrine of privity of contract applied in full force. The High Court judge was wrong when she ordered the 2nd defendant to cause a valid transfer of the land to the plaintiff in purported performance of the SPA when the 2nd defendant was not a party to the SPA. The 2nd defendant was at all material times, the lawful and registered beneficial owner of the said land by virtue of the fact that it was the lawful holder of the charge over the said land. Its interest in the land could only be removed on full satisfaction of the sums due under the loans given to the 1st defendant on terms acceptable to the 2nd defendant. (para 17)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The 2nd defendant had the best claim over the land. As registered chargee to the land, its interest was protected under the NLC. The ultimate transfer of the said land to any party was subject to the redemption of the loan amount owed to it by the 1st defendant, for which the charge was created over the said land. The fact that the land was sold to the plaintiff by way of a private treaty was a choice that was open to the 2nd defendant which option it had exercised. The High Court judge was thus in error when she ordered the 2nd defendant to transfer the land to the plaintiff on the terms as contained in her judgment. (paras 19-20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The annulment order dated 23 September 2010 had revoked <i>ab initio</i> the winding up order dated 13 June 2008 and revoked the appointment of the 1st liquidator. However, the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">Companies Act 1965</LINK> and the Companies (Winding-up) Rules 1972 are silent on the power of revocation. What is provided for is a stay of a winding up order, either for a period of time or permanently under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;243.;;">s 243(1) of the Companies Act 1965</LINK> or an appeal to the Court of Appeal under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;253.;;">s 253(2) of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>. In the instant case, there was no such application for stay or appeal. (para 23)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> The High Court judge had rightly concluded that the annulment order dated 23 September 2010 was wrongly obtained on the basis that one High Court cannot revoke an earlier High Court's order on the same matter. However the judge did not deal with the point that there is no provision for the annulment or revocation of a winding up order that has been granted. The High Court was correct to rule that the attack on the first winding up order dated 13 June 2008 ought to be pursued by way of appeal to the Court of Appeal. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> Based on <i>Eu Finance Berhad v. Lim Yoke Foo (refd)</i>, the annulment order dated 23 September 2010 would have no legal effect whatsoever and could, in law, be completely ignored as being ineffectual and thus inconsequential. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> Since the annulment order dated 23 September 2010 was a nullity, the first winding up order dated 13 June 2008 was at all times valid and subsisting. That being the case, the 1st defendant was at all times in perfect liquidation, pursuant to the first winding up order. A perfectly wound-up company cannot, in law be subject to another winding up exercise when the first winding up order is subsisting. Thus, the natural and logical conclusion would be that the appointment of the 2nd liquidator pursuant to the impugned creditors' voluntary winding up was unlawful and all the acts that the 2nd liquidator undertook including, in particular, the matters pertaining to the specific performance on behalf of the 1st defendant must therefore be tainted and be struck down for being devoid of legal basis. The 2nd liquidator could not do any act for the benefit of the 1st defendant as his appointment was devoid of any legitimacy. (<i>Sinarlim Sdn Bhd v. Waja Destinasi (M) Sdn Bhd (folld)</i>). (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> The second winding up did not clothe the 2nd liquidator with any legitimacy. The granting of the specific performance was wrong as the wrong party was cited in the application. The 1st liquidator ought to have been cited as acting for the 1st defendant. In the instant case, the plaintiff had named an incompetent party as the liquidator for the 1st defendant. The order of specific performance was void as it was an order which the 2nd liquidator could not enforce the transfer of the said land in order to redeem the charge. The 2nd liquidator lacked the necessary legal capacity to represent the 1st defendant who was the registered owner of the land. (paras 27-28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> Since the order of specific performance could not stand, the issue of the plaintiff being the rightful owner of the said land did not arise. As such, the issue of the said land to be transferred to the plaintiff and the matter of the late payment interest were both non-starters. (para 29)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This appeal is concerned with three enclosures, namely encl 1, encl 4 and encl 6. They had their origin in their respective grievances against the decision given by the learned High Court Judge in relation to an application filed in by the appellant purchaser MYCHEM Sdn Bhd (hereinafter referred to as "the plaintiff") for specific performance against vendor Maximum Marks Sdn Bhd (hereinafter referred to as "the 1st defendant") in respect of the sale and purchase of a property known as Geran Mukim Hakmilik No 1145, Lot 2399, 16th Mile Klang Road, Mukim Jeram, Daerah Kuala Selangor ("the said land") at the agreed price of RM3,850,000.00 and the United Overseas Bank (Malaysia) Bhd (hereinafter referred to as "the 2nd defendant") to thereafter execute and deliver to the plaintiff the discharge of charge and all such other instruments of dealings as necessary to remove the 2nd defendant's charge over the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 1st defendant is the registered owner of the land. United Overseas Bank (UOB) (the 2nd defendant) is the chargee of the said land vide legal charges registered under presentations No 1065-2007 and No 1066-2007. On 10 September 2009, the plaintiff entered into a sale and purchase agreement (hereinafter referred to as "the said agreement") with the 1st defendant wherein the 1st defendant agreed to sell the said land to the plaintiff at an agreed price of RM3,850,000.00. It was also agreed between parties therein that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Going back in time, as we must, on 13 June 2008, the 1st defendant was wound up by a court order vide a winding up petition filed by one Since Well Enterprise. The winding up court then appointed Mr Chang Chee Ching as the liquidator of the 1st defendant ("1st liquidator"). Mr Chang Chee Ching then had entered into the sale and purchase agreement dated 10 September 2009 on behalf of the 1st defendant in respect of the said land. In the meantime, on 28 January 2009, the 2nd defendant, being the registered chargee, had obtained an order for sale of the charged land. The plaintiff succeeded in obtaining an injunction pertaining to the sale of the said land by the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant subsequently agreed to allow the 1st liquidator to sell the land by way of a private treaty to the plaintiff. To enable the sale to go through, the 2nd defendant issued a redemption statement to the 1st liquidator, wherein the full purchase price shall be fully paid to the 2nd defendant by 10 December 2009. On 10 August 2009, the 2nd defendant received the sum of RM77,000.00 being 2% of the purchase price's deposit. On the 10 September 2009 the 2nd defendant received a further sum of RM308,000.00 being 8% of the deposit sum from the plaintiff, thereby making it the 10% deposit of the purchase price of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The plaintiff had obtained a bridging loan from EON Bank Bhd to assist in the purchase of the said land. The land transaction could not proceed further because on 14 September 2009, one Mr Tan Chiang Siang, who was the director and shareholder of the 1st defendant had lodged a private caveat on the said land. This resulted in the 1st defendant agreeing to an automatic extension of the said agreement until the private caveat was removed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Between May and June 2010, the 1st liquidator filed an action in court to have the caveat removed but was not successful. Due to the lodgement of the private caveat, the 2nd defendant never received the balance purchase price from the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Meanwhile, on 23 September 2010 vide Shah Alam High Court OS No: 24-2145-2010, the winding up order of 2008 was annulled <i>ab initio</i> and the 1st liquidator was removed from office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The 1st defendant was subsequently wound up through a creditors' voluntary winding up on 8 February 2011 and one Wong Weng Foo was appointed as the liquidator (2nd liquidator). Consequently, the 2nd defendant issued a solicitors' letter dated 16 May 2011 to the 1st liquidator to withdraw its consent to the redemption of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 15 July 2011, the plaintiff commenced this action seeking for the following orders from the High Court at Shah Alam:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The learned High Court Judge who heard the plaintiff's application had on 27 February 2013 decided that the specific performance was indeed the appropriate remedy to be granted to the plaintiff as prayed for, but that the plaintiff was liable to pay late interest payment to the 2nd defendant. Therefore, only prayers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 were allowed in respect of the plaintiff's application in encl 1 before the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The plaintiff was not entirely happy with the decision of the High Court Judge. In fact, it was partly aggrieved by it. The plaintiff's appeal was actually prosecuted to address that part of the decision of the High Court Judge, particularly with regard to the 8% late interest payment to be paid by the plaintiff to the 2nd defendant with effect from 10 December 2009 as stated in the Notice of Appeal which the plaintiff had filed on 18 March 2013. As stated earlier, the various enclosures before us had referred to the respective cross-appeals against the decision of the learned High Court Judge lodged by the 1st defendant and the 2nd defendant. We heard these enclosures on 22 September 2014.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Enclosure 1 is the plaintiff's appeal against part of the decision of the learned High Court Judge who had ordered the plaintiff to pay late interest to the 2nd defendant [the OUB Bank] at the rate of 8% per annum on a day to day basis on the balance of the purchase price of RM3,465,000.00 from 10 December 2009 until full payment. That date '10 December 2009' was the last date by which the plaintiff would have to pay the redemption sum to the 2nd defendant, being the registered chargee to the said land, before the charge could be lifted or discharged. According to the plaintiff, the effective date on which the late interest ought to be levied against the plaintiff should be on 23 May 2013 when the plaintiff had paid up the balance price after the caveat lodged on the said land had been finally removed and not on the 10 December 2009.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We had heard submissions and we agreed with learned counsel for the 2nd defendant [the bank] that the matter was clearly referred to in the sale and purchase agreement whereby cl 4.1(c) of the SPA expressly stipulated that in the event that the plaintiff failed to pay the full purchase price by the completion date, then the provision on late interest payments as so stipulated would kick in against the plaintiff being the purchaser of the said land. In other words, this had been a contractual obligation on the part of the plaintiff to fulfil. The court below was just stating the obvious result of that provision as there was default on the part of the plaintiff to pay the balance sum on the completion date which defined it as 10 December 2009. On that score alone, the plaintiff's appeal in encl 1 could not succeed. But that short shrift to the plaintiff's complaint before us did not effectively end this appeal in its entirety.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> We said so, because there were two cross-appeals before us as well. There had been encl 4 dated 28 March 2013 being the cross-appeal of the 1st defendant ['Maximum Mark'] and encl 6 dated 17 April 2013, being that of the 2nd defendant ['the bank'].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We will deal with encl 4 first before dealing with encl 6. Enclosure 4 is concerned with the 1st defendant's cross-appeal against the High Court order that had ordered the 1st defendant, through the instrumentality of the 2nd liquidator, Mr Wong to execute and deliver to the plaintiff the memorandum of transfer and other necessary instruments of dealings to cause a valid transfer of the said land to the plaintiff within seven days after the balance purchase price and late payment interest had been settled with the 2nd defendant [the chargee bank].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Having read and having considered the submissions of learned counsel for the 1st defendant we are in agreement that the learned trial judge had erred in coming to her decision. Her decision had demonstrated serious inconsistencies in her conclusions in relation to crucial facts that had led to her arriving at a flawed decision that to our mind, with respect, could not be sustained. It all had to do with the true effect of the annulment order and the appointment of the 2nd liquidator made pursuant to the 2nd winding order by the creditors pursuant to a creditor's voluntary winding up under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;260.;;">s 260 of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> To our mind, the learned trial judge was in error when she recognised the appointment of the 2nd liquidator when she had herself ruled that the court order dated 23 September 2010 that sought to annul the previous winding up order <i>ab initio</i>, was bad in law. The learned judge was correct when she had ruled that the subsequent High Court Judge could not overrule a valid High Court order that had ordered the winding up of the 1st defendant earlier in 2008. But she had fallen into error when she had proceeded on to rule that the SPA ought to be enforced by way of specific performance against the 1st defendant vide the 2nd liquidator. By doing that she had recognised that the second winding up as valid and that the appointment of the 2nd liquidator was competent. In the circumstances, we agree with the learned counsel for the 1st defendant that the decision of the learned trial judge was flawed. On that score alone, the judge was plainly wrong and the order of specific performance against the 1st defendant ought not to be allowed to stand. With this ruling too, the appeal of the plaintiff would have no leg to stand on and its appeal on late interest could not therefore succeed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Enclosure 6 relates to the 2nd defendant's [the chargee bank] cross-appeal against the order of the learned judge who had ordered the 2nd defendant to execute and to deliver to the plaintiff the discharge of charge documents and all other documents required to discharge the charges in favour the 2nd defendant within seven days of receiving the balance purchase price and late payment interest from the plaintiff. It was argued before us by learned counsel for the 2nd defendant that the bank was not privy to the SPA between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. The doctrine of privity of contract applied in full force. The learned High Court Judge was wrong when she made the order that the 2nd defendant cause a valid transfer of the said land to the plaintiff in purported performance of the SPA which the 2nd defendant was not a party to the SPA. The 2nd defendant was at all material times, the lawful and registered beneficial owner of the said land by virtue of the fact that it was the lawful holder of the charge over the said land. Its interest in the land can only be removed on full satisfaction of the sums due under the loans given to the 1st defendant on terms acceptable to the 2nd defendant. Only after the loan amounts under the respective loans for which the said land was charged to the bank have been fully redeemed will the said land be released to the appropriate party.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> As was noted earlier, the plaintiff had obtained an injunction against the 2nd defendant from disposing the said land on pain of paying damages to the 2nd defendant for the injunction that it had obtained against the 2nd defendant regarding the disposal of the said land by the latter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In the whole scheme of things, this court agrees with the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant that his client has the best claim over the said land, as a registered chargee to the said land its interest is protected under the National Land Code. The ultimate transfer of the said land to any party is subject to the loan amount, that was being owed to it by the 1st defendant for which the charge was created over the said land, having first being redeemed in full. It does not matter how the charge was redeemed and indeed the 2nd defendant would only be concerned that the loan amount was fully satisfied on terms as agreed between the 1st defendant, being the charger and itself as contained in the relevant loan document evidencing the charge. As such, the fact that the said land be sold to the plaintiff by way of a private treaty was a choice that was open to the 2nd defendant which option it had exercised. As far as the 2nd defendant was concerned, the said land was a security for the loan taken by the 1st defendant and the proceeds of its sale to the plaintiff may or may not be sufficient to fully redeem the loan amount [plus interest and legitimate expenses]. If the sale proceeds are insufficient to meet the loan amount, the 2nd defendant may not release the charge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Under the circumstances, the learned High Court Judge was in error when she ordered the 2nd defendant to transfer the said land to the plaintiff in the terms as contained in her judgment. We agree with the learned counsel for the 2nd defendant that the law reports are replete with cases that had clearly borne out the exalted position of a registered chargee over the charged property. The Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_308;"><i>Eng Ah Mooi &amp; Ors v. Oversea Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 308</LINK>; [1983] 1 MLJ 209 had occasion to say the following:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> It was quite apparent that the appeals of the various parties had been argued on the premise that the order of specific performance granted by the learned High Court Judge was properly obtained. But to our mind, the order of specific performance itself must be impugned.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In the main, this court agrees with the submissions of learned counsel for the 1st defendant that the learned High Court Judge was wrong to grant the specific performance applied for by the plaintiff against the 1st defendant which was at the material time under the management of the 2nd liquidator, Mr Wong. This is because the 2nd liquidator was appointed after the purported second winding up by way of voluntary winding up by the creditors. At this juncture, two milestones in the historical journey of the 1st defendant since it was first wound up in 2008 must require special attention by this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The first milestone was the purported 'annulment' of the first winding up order of the 1st defendant by the High Court at Shah Alam dated 23 September 2010. This 'annulment order' contained two major features of some significance; [1] that the winding up order dated 13 June 2008 that sent the 1st defendant into liquidation was revoked <i>ab initio</i>, and [2] that the appointment of the 1st liquidator was also revoked. Now, the law is clear on this matter of revocation of a winding up order. In fact, our <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;;">Companies Act 1965</LINK> is silent on revocation of a winding up order that has been granted. The Companies (Winding-up) Rules 1972 is also silent on power of revocation. What is provided for is the stay of a winding up order, either for a period of time or permanently under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;243.;;">s 243(1) of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>. In the event that the stay order granted is a permanent one, it has the effect of a revoking the winding up. But in our case here, there was no application for stay. What was applied for and was granted was that the winding up order be revoked <i>ab initio</i>. The other option open to the aggrieved party in a winding up proceeding would be to appeal to the Court of Appeal as provided for under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1973_125;253.;;">s 253(2) of the Companies Act 1965</LINK>. The following cases are authorities for the legal propositions mentioned above, namely <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_4_356;"><i>Megah Teknik Sdn Bhd v. Miracle Resources Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 4 MLRA 356</LINK>; [2010] 4 MLJ 651; [2010] 6 CLJ 745 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_203;"><i>Vijayalakshmi Devi Nadchatiram v. Jegadevan Nadchatiram &amp; Ors</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 203</LINK>; [1995] 1 MLJ 830; [1995] 2 CLJ 392.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> We noted that in her Grounds of Judgment, the learned trial judge did address her mind to this issue. In fact, she had correctly directed her mind to the issue on the purported annulment order dated 23 September 2010 and she had rightly concluded that the annulment order was wrongly obtained in the sense that it was granted by a High Court and that a High Court cannot revoke an earlier High Court order on the same matter. It was not dealt with from the angle that there was no provision for annulment or revocation of a winding up order that has been granted. In any event, she was correct in saying that the attack on the first winding up order dated 13 June 2008 ought to be pursued by the aggrieved party by way of an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> But the matter did not end there. That was because there was the subsequent winding up [the second winding up] by way of voluntary winding up by the creditors against the 1st defendant. Taking the cue from the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_507;"><i>Eu Finance Berhad v. Lim Yoke Foo</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 507</LINK>; [1982] 2 MLJ 37, the annulment order dated 23 September 2010 would have no legal effect whatsoever and can, in law, be completely ignored as being ineffectual and thus inconsequential. As it had transpired, as a result of the second winding up, a 2nd liquidator was appointed to administer the 1st defendant and it was during his tenure that the specific performance of the SPA was sought to be enforced by the plaintiff against the 1st defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Now, what had apparently happened was that the 1st defendant had been subject to the winding up process 'twice'. As the purported annulment order dated 23 September 2010 was a nullity, the net result of that would be that the first winding up order dated 13 June 2008 was at all times valid and subsisting as the terms of the annulment order were rendered impotent by its inherent illegality. That being the case, the 1st defendant was at all times in perfect liquidation, pursuant to the first winding up order. As a necessary corollary to that, a perfectly wound up company cannot, in law be subject to another winding up exercise when a prior winding up order is still subsisting against it. This legal proposition resides in the Court of Appeal's decision in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_242;"><i>Sinarlim Sdn Bhd v. Waja Destinasi (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 242</LINK>; [2012] 3 CLJ 678. The natural and logical conclusion that would flow from that would be that the appointment of the 2nd liquidator pursuant to the impugned voluntary winding up by the creditor was unlawful and all the acts that he undertook including, in particular, the matters pertaining to the specific performance on behalf of the 1st defendant must therefore be tainted and be struck down for being devoid of legal basis. Indeed, he could not do any act for the benefit of the 1st defendant as his appointment was devoid of any legitimacy. The 2nd milestone therefore must be the purported second winding up of the 1st defendant by the creditors which had created its own series of impugned acts.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As we had seen, the 2nd liquidator was appointed pursuant to this winding up exercise. We had considered the legal ramifications of that exercise. In gist, the second winding up exercise did not clothe the 2nd liquidator with any legitimacy at all. On that premise, the granting of the specific performance was wrong as the wrong party were cited in the application. The 1st liquidator ought to be cited as acting for the 1st defendant. In other words, an incompetent party was named by the plaintiff as the liquidator for the 1st defendant. This fact was clearly borne out in the application [Saman Pemula] for specific performance, whereby it was sent to the 1st defendant and was addressed to: "dan/atau alamat pelikuidasinya, Wong Weng Foo ..." It was not in dispute that Mr Wong Weng Foo was the 2nd liquidator, whereas the 1st liquidator as appointed by the court under the first winding up order was one Mr Chang Chee Ching. As Mr Wong was appointed pursuant to the second winding up, his appointment to act for the 1st defendant was legally untenable in view of the fact that the second winding up was bad in law. Mr Wong had no legal basis to act for the 1st defendant who ought to have been legally represented by Mr Chang as the first winding up order was at the material times still valid for all intent and purposes. To our mind, the order of specific performance is void as it is an order which the named 2nd liquidator could not enforce the transfer of the said land in order to redeem the charge. The 2nd liquidator lacked the necessary legal capacity to represent the 1st defendant who was the registered owner of the said land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Under the circumstances, the order for specific performance [and its related orders] granted by the High Court Judge on 27 February 2012 could not stand and we hereby set it aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Premised on the above, after perusing the Record of Appeals, and considering submissions by all parties, we had dismissed the plaintiff's appeal. In light of the above, since the order of specific performance could not stand, the issue of the plaintiff being the rightful owner of the said land does not now arise. As such, the issue of the said land to be transferred to the plaintiff and the matter on the late payment interest both have become a non-starter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The 1st defendant's appeal was allowed with costs. The order of the learned trial judge ordering the 2nd liquidator to facilitate the specific performance of the SPA is set aside. To dispel any doubt, the order on specific performance issued by the learned trial judge is set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The 2nd defendant's appeal was allowed in respect of the damages. As specific performance of the SPA is now an irrelevant factor, it is therefore only just that the plaintiff be ordered to pay damages to the 2nd defendant pursuant to its undertaking on the matter. We so ordered. The quantum of damages was ordered to be assessed by the Registrar of the court below.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> Essentially, parties were put back to their original positions before the SPA was entered into. The deposit sum paid in pursuance of the SPA ought to be refunded by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff, but as the deposit had been paid to and received by the 2nd defendant, we therefore order that the deposit must be refunded by the 2nd defendant to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> We awarded costs to both the defendants in the sum of RM10,000 each, to be paid by the plaintiff. To reiterate, the orders of the learned High Court Judge dated 27 February 2012 were set aside. We ordered too, that the deposit for the appeal to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Order accordingly.</p>
