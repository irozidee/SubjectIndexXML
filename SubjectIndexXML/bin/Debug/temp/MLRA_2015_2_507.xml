      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The Minister of Home Affairs had ordered the prohibition of the appellants' book under the Printing and Presses and Publications (Control of Undesirable Publications) (No 6) Order 2010 ("the Minister's order"). The police had also seized 33 copies of the book. The appellants thus applied to the High Court for judicial review of the prohibition and seizure. The High Court dismissed the application, resulting in the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> Judicial review arises from the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. Just as the High Court's appellate jurisdiction is limited, so also the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction in judicial review is only to intervene when the power or discretion given to an administrator is abused. To proceed beyond such boundary would be an interference in the appellate jurisdiction, with the jurisdiction of the court of first instance, and in judicial review, the powers and discretions placed upon administrators as part of and in the carrying out of their duties and responsibilities. (paras 6-7)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Judicial review is not conducted as a civil suit where a trial is held. It is governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. Even though the application for judicial review is affidavit based, the fundamental rule is that the burden is upon the applicant to prove his case for judicial review upon a balance of probabilities. (para 11)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In matters involving security and public order, the disclosure of the information upon which action is taken is undesirable and not amendable to judicial review. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> This court would accept the appellants' contention that generally, the suppression of dissent builds up resentment and allowing dissent would be likely to preserve public order. The opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies is a way to ensure the democratic form of government. In safeguarding individual rights, the courts must always be wary of the arbitrary exercise of authority and unreasonableness. (para 13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In judicial review, the question whether a decision has a political purpose is irrelevant. In the instant judicial review application, the scrutiny was whether the appellants had proved upon a balance of probabilities that there had been an abuse of the power or discretion under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 ("the Act")</LINK>. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Although the Minister's discretion under s 7(1) of the Act is expressed to be an absolute discretion, such discretion is nevertheless subject to judicial review. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(7)</b> From a consideration of the nature of the appellants' book, its contents and assertive presentation of the appellants' opinion on matters in the book did not discount the possibility of conflict as would raise the need to act to preserve public order. The Minister's order was not clearly one that was not intended to preserve public order. In other words, that the Minister's order was to preserve public order could not be dismissed outright. (para 24)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(8)</b> The Act does not provide for a right to be heard. Section 7(1) of the Act provides that once the Minister is satisfied as to the matters in the first part of the section, the decision to prohibit or not or to prohibit absolutely or on terms is at the absolute discretion of the Minister. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(9)</b> Although the Act does not require the Minsiter to give reasons, persons affected by the Minister's order are not without a remedy as reasons may be obtained through judicial review where if the Minister does not give reasons it will be held that he has no good reasons. (para 29)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(10)</b> There was nothing to show that the appellants' book was incapable of affecting public order and that the Minister's order was an abuse of s 7(1) of the Act. (para 32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(11)</b> The facts relied upon by the appellants were not capable of proving that the Minister had abused his power under s 7(1) of the Act. The High Court thus did not err in dismissing the application for a judicial review of the Minister's order. (paras 49-50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(12)</b> There was nothing in the Act that confined the police to acting only under the Act in respect of printing presses and publications. The police were not prohibited by the Act from seizing publications under the Criminal Procedure Code or under any other legislation authorising such seizure in the course of an investigation. Since the seizures were not made under the Act, no question of judicial review on the grounds relied upon under the Act arose. The High Court was thus right in dismissing that part of the application for judicial review. (paras 57-58)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellants Yong Thye Chong and Oriengroup Sdn Bhd appealed to this court against the dismissal by the High Court of their application in Semakan Kehakiman No: R2-25-491-2010 for judicial review of:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appeal before us adds to judicial review the further dimensions of the Minister's satisfaction and an absolute discretion granted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984 Act 301</LINK> ("s 7(1)" and "Act 301" respectively).</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Structure Of The Appellants' Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The submissions for the appellants is structured as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> We adopt the introduction, summary of challenge as to the prohibition and the seizure in the submissions for the appellants as our template as these adequately address the issues raised for the appellants, repeated and covered in more detail in the later parts. We refer to the later parts of the submissions, as well as submissions for the respondents as and when necessary.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellants' Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In the introduction, it was submitted that the suppression of dissent builds up resentment, allowing dissent would be likely to preserve public order, that the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies is the only way to ensure our democratic form of government; and in safeguarding individual rights, the courts must always be wary of the exercise of arbitrary authority and unreasonableness. The introduction proceeded with the submission that the court must check the abuse of statutory powers by Ministers for political purposes. It was submitted that in this case, the Minister so obviously banned a reasoned book of political criticism purely in order to preserve the reputation of his colleagues from his own political party and there was absolutely no evidence of any threat to public order by the publication of the appellants' book, not even an allegation by the Minister that the contents were not true. The introduction closed with the submission that the High Court thus erred in refusing to quash the ban.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Before proceeding further, it is necessary to remind ourselves on the principles of judicial review. It is not an appeal from the decision of the administrator, in this case, the police in respect of the seizure and the Minister in respect of the prohibition of the appellants' book. Judicial review arises from the supervisory jurisdiction of the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> Just as the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to intervene is limited by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;72.;;">s 72 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 Act 91</LINK> that no judgment or order of the High Court, or of any judge, shall be reversed or substantially varied on appeal, nor a new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal, on account of any error, defect, or irregularity, whether in the decision or otherwise not affecting the merits or the jurisdiction of the court, so also the supervisory jurisdiction in judicial review is not to interfere but to intervene when the power or discretion given to an administrator is abused. To proceed beyond that boundary would be an interference in the appellate jurisdiction, with the jurisdiction of the court of first instance and in judicial review, the powers and discretions placed upon administrators as part of and in the carrying out of their duties and responsibilities. See in respect of limit to power of judicial review in <i>Chief Constable of North Wales Police v. Evans</i> [1982] 3 All ER 141. The fundamental principle is that the court intervenes where the power or discretion is abused.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> After reviewing the established grounds where judicial review was allowed, Lord Diplock, in <i>Council of Civil Service Unions and Ors v. Minister for the Civil Service</i> [1985] AC 374, categorised the established grounds for intervention by judicial review under three broad grounds with a possible fourth. These were (a) illegality, (b) irrationality, and (c) procedural impropriety. His Lordship also listed a possible fourth ground, "proportionality", as warranting further consideration. The debate as to "proportionality" continues as it approaches uncomfortably close to interference with the discretion or power which had been given.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The categorisation does not, however, necessarily resolve the question of how far the courts may look into the decision making by the administrator. In <i>Chief Constable of North Wales Police v. Evans (supra)</i>, it was held that judicial review is concerned not with the decision, but with the decision-making process, and unless the restriction on the power of the court is observed, the court itself will be guilty of usurping power under the guise of preventing the abuse of power.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_1_511;"><i>Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2002] 1 MLRA 511</LINK>; [2002] 3 MLJ 72; [2004] 4 CLJ 105; [2002] 3 AMR 2817, followed by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2003_2_399;"><i>Kerajaan Malaysia &amp; Ors v. Nasharuddin Nasir</i> [2003] 2 MLRA 399</LINK>; [2004] 1 CLJ 81; [2005] 6 AMR 497, Mohamed Dzaiddin FCJ (as he then was) in the Federal Court, said that the statement often made that judicial review is concerned not with the decision but the decision making process, at full face value, may well convey the impression that the jurisdiction of the courts in judicial review proceedings is confined to cases where the aggrieved party has not received fair treatment by the authority to which he has been subjected, but in practice, the three grounds set out by Lord Diplock permits the courts to scrutinise such decisions not only for process, but also for substance."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> That scrutiny of the decision for substance does not mean that judicial review is conducted as a civil suit and a trial is held. It is governed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. Even though the application for judicial review is affidavit based, the fundamental rule remains that the burden is upon the applicant to prove his case for judicial review upon a balance of probabilities. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_2_46;"><i>Mohamad Ezam Mohd Noor v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2002] 2 MLRA 46</LINK>; [2002] 4 MLJ 449; [2002] 4 CLJ 309; [2002] 4 AMR 4053 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_378;"><i>Yeap Hock Seng @ Ah Seng v. Minister For Home Affairs, Malaysia &amp; Ors</i> [1975] 1 MLRH 378</LINK>; [1976] 1 MLJ 287.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Even so, in matters involving security and public order, the disclosure of the information upon which action is taken is undesirable and not amenable to judicial review (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_369;"><i>Dato' Seri Syed Hamid Syed Jaafar Albar (Menteri Dalam Negeri) v.

    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Returning to the appellants' introduction, we accept that generally the suppression of dissent builds up resentment, allowing dissent would be likely to preserve public order, that the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies is a way to ensure our democratic form of government; and in safeguarding individual rights, the courts must always be wary of the arbitrary exercise of authority and unreasonableness.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> We have said earlier in this judgement that judicial review in the supervisory jurisdiction scrutinises the exercise of administrative powers and discretions for abuses. Since it can safely be accepted that the public would support a good decision and condemn a bad one, and different members of the public may have different views whether a decision is good or bad, we hold that the question whether a decision has a political purpose is irrelevant, and that the scrutiny in the judicial review applications as whether the appellant and applicant for judicial review had proved upon a balance of probabilities the facts relied upon to show there had been an abuse of the power or discretion granted under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Act 301</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> As to the facts relied upon that the appellants' book is a reasoned book of political criticism, the Minister's order is obviously and purely to preserve the reputation of his colleagues from his own political party, and whether the Minister did so when there was absolutely no evidence of any threat to public order by the publication of the appellants' book, not even an allegation by the Minister that the contents were not true, we do not think it appropriate to make that decision in the introduction stage of the appellants' case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Minister's Order</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Although the Minister's discretion is expressed in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7 of Act 301</LINK> to be an absolute discretion, a careful reading shows it is in respect of whether or not to ban and the conditions that the Minister may impose. Parliament could not have intended, in the absence of clear and specific language, to authorise the Minister to act arbitrarily, or to act illegally, to act with procedural impropriety or to act irrationally. Therefore, although the discretion given is expressed to be an absolute discretion, the exercise of the absolute discretion is nevertheless subject to judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The submission that the Minister's order is <i>ultra vires</i><LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7 of Act 301</LINK> because the appellant's book is not a publication contrary to public order, but merely a collection of essays regarding current affairs in Malaysian politics and Government administration, ie matters of public interest, begs the question whether the appellant's book contains things in any manner prejudicial to or likely to be prejudicial to public order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> After reading the copy of the appellant's book, we make the following observations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Unlike the copies of articles floating separately on the internet, the articles were presented in a convenient single book. Together and with the addition in the appellant's book, they provide much magnified impact that the individual articles had or the additional pages would have had. The case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_5_369;"><i>Dato' Seri Syed Hamid Syed Jaafar Albar (Menteri Dalam Negeri) v. SIS Forum (Malaysia)</i> [2012] 5 MLRA 369</LINK>; [2012] 6 MLJ 340; [2012] 9 CLJ 297; [2012] 6 AMR 97 is distinguishable. The appellant's book makes no pretence to be academic, as a study on politics or law. The fact that politicians, lawyers and academics comment or express opinions upon the matters in the appellant's book does not elevate the book to be of academic value. Nor does it bear the hallmark of academic value of objectivity and objective analysis.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> That the appellant's book is a collection of essays regarding current affairs in Malaysian politics and Government administration is an understatement. It is a book that one might as a Malaysian pick up from a display shelf in a bookstore out of curiosity. Leafing through its index and pages, one is more than likely to find the topics and the language shocking. One would put it back quickly, with the question in one's mind, "Are the allegations true?" If all would do the same there could be no harm in the book and there would be no justification for the Minister's order. Likewise, if the appellant's book was simply a book of political criticism, there would be no justification for the Minister to make the Minister's order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> But the appellant's book, in assertive and high octane language, put forward the appellant's judgment on the events described in the book. The submission that the Minister's order is purely in order to preserve the reputation of his colleagues from his own political party is admissions that the appellant's book is an attack on the reputation. It provides people politically minded but against the parties targeted in the book, with impetus to further fuel their opposition. While the politically minded but support those parties in the appellant's book will find the appellant's book provocative. The appellant's book is an assault upon key persons in the elected government.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> We express no concern with one side or the other. But from the foregoing consideration, we find it hard to say that the appellant's book does not make a loud voice on the stage for conflict.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> It was submitted that under the guise of public order, the Minister made the ban for an ulterior/improper purpose - namely to preserve the image of the Government of the day, that the ban is clearly not to preserve public order but rather to stifle legitimate criticism of the ruling Government and to safeguard the reputations of politicians conducting their affairs in Malaysia, and as such inconsistent with the right to free speech enshrined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. In short, the ban is an attempt by the respondents to stifle that "free trade in ideas" that is the hallmark of a modern and vibrant democracy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> From our foregoing consideration of the nature of the appellant's book, its contents and assertive presentation of the appellant's judgement on the matters in the book does not discount the possibility of conflict as would raise the need to act to preserve public order. The appellant's criticisms, compiled in a book were more impactful than the separate articles at different times, and is independently capable of being material for fuelling conflict. The Minister's order is not clearly one that is not intended to preserve public order. In other words, that the Minister's order was to preserve public order cannot be dismissed outright.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We accept that the Minister's order does have the effect of stifling the appellant's criticism, through his book, of the ruling government and the reputations of the politicians in government. We recognise it has the apparent effect of protecting the ruling government and of those politicians in government. We recognise whether the appellation "legitimate" may be attached to the appellant's criticism or not depends on which side of the political divide one stands. But the question before the court in judicial review is whether the Minister's order is necessarily an abuse of the Minister's power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Act 301</LINK>. For in essence every freedom and right, however strongly stated in any treaty, law or constitution is not absolute unless specifically stated to be so. for example, freedom of movement is not a defence to dangerous driving nor is freedom of speech and of the press a defence to defamation, let alone to exhort readers and listeners to acts of public disorder and to threaten national security. The freedoms under the constitution is not for just one person but for all. It is therefore a balance where someone's rights ends where someone else's rights begins.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It was submitted that the Minister's order is tainted by procedural impropriety. The two grounds of procedural impropriety are that there was no opportunity to be heard given to the appellants before the Minister's order was made, and no reasons were given to the 1st appellant when the Minister made his order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The Minister's order was made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Act 301</LINK> which provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The argument that a right to be heard must be given before an order is made makes impossible the making of an order when the maker or publisher is not identifiable. Hence, <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> does not provide for a right to be heard. We note that the appellant of course belongs to that small minority who puts his name, <i>albeit</i> a pen name, to his articles. Nevertheless, the section provides that once the precondition the Minister is satisfied as to the matters in the first part of the section is met, then whether to prohibit or not, and if to prohibit, whether absolutely or on terms is specifically provided to be in the absolute discretion of the Minister.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Nor does <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> require that the Minister gives reasons. The existence of a remedy by seeking judicial review of the Minister's order means that such persons affected by the Minister's order is not without remedy. It gave Parliament the option of not providing for an alternative appeal route. The reasons can then be obtained in the course of judicial review where if the Minister does not give reasons, it will be held that he has no good reasons. See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2002_2_46;"><i>Mohamad Ezam Mohd Noor v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Other Appeals</i> [2002] 2 MLRA 46</LINK>; [2002] 4 MLJ 449; [2002] 4 CLJ 309; [2002] 4 AMR 4053.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> It was submitted that the Minister's order was irrational and wholly disproportionate to its stated aim. More particularly it was submitted that no reasonable decision maker similarly circumstanced could conceive that this appellant's book, which has been in circulation for some six months since March 2010 with almost all of the essays contained in the book having been published on the internet at various times between 2006 - 2010 with no incident of public disorder, could be a threat to public order. It was submitted further that the appellant's book has been totally banned for isolated essays read out of context in each section.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> We note that the Minister's order does not prohibit the earlier articles but only the appellant's compilation of these articles with additional 50 pages. Having read the appellant's book included in the record of appeal, we recall its impact and effect when we read the book. We do not however recall the same effect with each article. Thus, the fact no action was taken on the articles between 2006 until 2010 does not mean the appellant's book is not capable of affecting public order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> From the foregoing, we conclude that there is nothing that shows that the appellant's book is incapable of affecting public order and the Minister's order is necessarily an abuse of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Act 301</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> It was submitted that the High Court erred when:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_205;"><i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 205</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 765 ; [2014] 6 CLJ 541 having held that the correct test is the objective test, the Federal Court by majority, examined the grounds of judgment of the High Court and found that notwithstanding stating it was applying the subjective test, the High Court had in fact applied the objective test. Thus, it is the judgement that was examined to determine what was the test actually applied. This is consistent with the purpose of written grounds of judgement to demonstrate the findings and reasoning leading to the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> However, before proceeding to applying an objective test, it must first be determined upon what is that test to be applied? In simple terms, the objective test is applied upon (a) facts relied upon that are not disputed and (b) findings of fact on disputed facts based upon evidence produced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> Before the High Court were the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Exhibited in the appellants' affidavits of 3 November 2010 are exhs K-1 to K16 and of 25 May 2011, exhs K17-K28.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> The appellants' affidavit in support dated 3 November 2010 of the application for leave granted on 24 January 2011, set out details of the parties, the seizure of 33 copies of the appellant's book at the four locations, the prohibition of the appellant's book, never given any notice about the prohibition or the grounds for the prohibition except the ground indicated on the Order "prejudicial to public order", no opportunity to be heard before the order was made, belief that the seizure and the prohibition were with malicious intent, international norms protecting fundamental human rights regarding restrictions against the freedom of speech ought to be applied, claim for damages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> The averments merely set out the factual and legal foundations relied upon for the application. But for judicial review to succeed, it is essential to establish that the Minister abused his power under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Act 301</LINK>. In this regard, it was only averred as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> The averments by the appellants were denied by the 1st respondent in the latter's affidavit of 4 May 2011. The Minister, except as specifically admitted, denied the assertions made by the appellant and asserted threat to public order. In his affidavit in reply dated 25 May 2011, the appellant repeated his arguments for his case. In respect of the Minister's, the appellant repeated his earlier averment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Apart from the fact evident from the contents in the book that it attacked the ruling government and certain individuals in the ruling government and parties in the coalition, and the appellant's articles relied upon the various newspaper and other publications, including decision of the High Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_1_379;"><i>Harris Mohd Salleh v. The Returning Officer, Ismail Majin &amp; Ors (And Another Petition)</i> [2001] 1 MLRH 379</LINK>; [2001] 3 MLJ 433; [2001] 3 CLJ 161; [2001] 3 AMR 2683, there was no evidence that the Minister acted upon ground other than that as stated in the Minister's order and repeated in his affidavit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The averments above are as to the motive of the Minister. They are in the nature of accusations of <i>mala fide</i> in detention cases. In <i>Mohamad Ezam Mohd Noor v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Other Appeals (supra)</i>, Mohamed Dzaiddin CJ relied upon Basu's Commentary on the Constitution of India, 15th edn, vol 2 p 153 and <i>Yeap Hock Seng @ Ah Seng v. Minister For Home Affairs, Malaysia &amp; Ors (supra)</i> to hold that (1) the onus of proving <i>mala fide</i> on the part of the detaining authority is on the applicant and ... what is required is proof of improper or bad motive in order to invalidate the detention or order for <i>mala fide</i> and not mere suspicions and (2) where an order of detention is challenged on the ground of <i>mala fide</i>, what has got to be made out is not the want of <i>bona fide</i> on the part of the police, but the want of <i>bona fide</i> as well as the non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority which for this purpose must be taken to be different from the police. It was recognised it is difficult to prove <i>mala fide</i>. Likewise the motive of the Minister and non application of his mind to the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;7.;;">s 7(1) of Act 301</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> As we have said earlier, the procedure of judicial review is governed under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. An application for leave in Form 111A is made ex parte to a Judge in Chambers and supported by:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Although the application is made ex parte, the applicant must give notice of the application for leave not later than three days before the hearing date to the Attorney General's Chambers and must at the same time lodge in those Chambers copies of the statement and affidavits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> When leave has been granted under this rule, the applicant shall, within 14 days after the grant of such leave, file a notice in Form 111B [O 53 r 4(1)]. Upon extraction of the sealed copy of Form 111B, the applicant shall serve a copy of the same together with a copy of the statement and all affidavits in support on all persons directly affected by the application not later than 14 days before the date of hearing specified in the said Form [O 53 r 4(2)].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> Though the basis process is affidavit based, O 53 r 6 provides for discovery:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The above is relevant to the evaluation of the application for judicial review and of its affidavit evidence. An affidavit as to matters directly to his knowledge is evidence safe to rely upon, contradicted by superior or other evidence or unless successfully challenged in cross-examination. An affidavit as to honest belief is safe to rely on if not denied, contradicted by superior or other evidence or successfully cross-examined. An affidavit of belief is neither here nor there. The processes of discovery and interrogatories set the stage for cross-examination and superior and other evidence in order to determine ultimately whether an applicant for judicial review has successfully proved his case upon a balance of probabilities or not.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> Notwithstanding having three months before the hearing on 25 April 2011, nothing in the record shows and attempt at discovery or interrogatories. Nor were the deponents cross-examined. The evidence before the court remained as per the application, statement, affidavit in support, affidavits in opposition, affidavit in reply and the exhibits produced.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> The fact that the book is a political attack upon the ruling government and the certain individuals and parties mentioned in the appellant's book may to those against the government be proof upon a balance of probabilities that the Minister's order is an abuse of his power under s 7(1) while to those who support the government, it does not. Objectively, the facts relied upon is capable of supporting either conclusion. It does not ipso facto prove that the Minister abused his power under s 7(1) by making the Minister's order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> We conclude, therefore, that the High Court did not err in dismissing the application for judicial review of the Minister's order and even if the High Court took into consideration <i>Mohamad Ezam Mohd Noor v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Other Appeals (supra)</i>, it would not have affected the decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Seizure</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> As to the seizure, it was submitted that the seizure was illegal as:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> It was further submitted for the appellants that the High Court erred:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> Counsel for the appellants correctly observed that the sole ground on which the High Court rejected this part of the application was to consider that the seizures were done pursuant to a power to investigate, and that investigative powers were not amenable to judicial review. The High Court relied upon <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2004_6_212;"><i>Ahmad Azam Mohamad Salleh &amp; Ors v. Jabatan Pembangunan Koperasi Malaysia &amp; Ors</i> [2004] 6 MLRH 212</LINK>, that a decision made under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1993_502;67.;;">s 67 of Co-operative Societies Act 1993</LINK> is not reviewable because it relates to an inspection or an inquiry. The High Court also cited <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1999_1_316;"><i>Cheah Foong Chiew v. Lembaga Jurutera Malaysia</i> [1999] 1 MLRA 316</LINK>; [1999] 3 MLJ 110; [1999] 3 CLJ 242; [1999] 2 AMR 2421 which held that as a matter of judicial policy, the court should not intervene but should allow the domestic tribunal to proceed and decide the matter; and it is wrong for the court to intervene at this stage as that would amount to restraining the respondent from hearing the charge against the appellant and pre-empt the respondent's right under the law to adjudicate the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> It was submitted that the High Court failed to consider the High Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_1_718;"><i>Empayar Canggih Sdn Bhd v. Ketua Pengarah Bahagian Penguatkuasa Kementerian Perdagangan Dalam Negeri Dan Hal Ehwal Pengguna Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 1 MLRH 718</LINK>; [2010] 9 CLJ 46. Perusing the said case, we find that at para 15 the High Court held that "... Public policy will require that courts should be slow to interfere unless there has been some jurisdictional error, error of law or manifest unreasonableness within the statutory context ..."</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> The submissions on <i>ultra vires</i> based illegality, being contrary to the provisions of <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> is sustainable only if it is established that the police in this instance was acting under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK>. The issue is whether in relation to printing presses and publications, the police are confined to act under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> and no other legislation, and on that basis decide whether to intervene upon the grounds of <i>ultra vires</i> and illegality. The case of <i>Empayar Canggih Sdn Bhd v. Ketua Pengarah Bahagian Penguatkuasa Kementerian Perdagangan Dalam Negeri Dan Hal Ehwal Pengguna Malaysia &amp; Anor</i> is not inconsistent with this approach, unless there is in fact <i>ultra vires</i> or illegality or jurisdictional error, error of law or manifest unreasonableness for that matter, the court should not intervene at the stage of investigations lest it be an interference with the investigations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;16.;;">Sections 16</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;17.;;">17</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;18.;;">18</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;19.;;">19(4) of Act 301</LINK> provide as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> We find nothing in <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> that confines the police to acting only under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> in respect of printing presses and publications. We asked ourselves whether a publication contrary to the preservation of public order loses that dangerous property or becomes so less dangerous because its seizure was not made initially under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> that is must be returned. We find it difficult to accept that if an ordinary policeman seizes a book entitled provocatively for example, "The Anarchist's Cookbook" from a bookstore, and upon reporting the seizure to his superiors it is found to be contrary to preservation of public order, it must nevertheless be returned to the bookstore for continued distribution. Nor is there authority for any proposition that having commenced investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code the police cannot report the matter to the Minister to consider making an order under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In short, we hold that the police is not prohibited by <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> from seizing publications under the Criminal Procedure Code or under any other legislation authorising such seizure in the course of an investigation. Accordingly, since the seizures were not made under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK>, no question of judicial review on the grounds relied upon under <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1984_301;;">Act 301</LINK> arises, and the High Court was right in dismissing this part of the application for judicial review.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. By agreement of both parties, no order as to costs. We order the deposit to be refunded.</p>
