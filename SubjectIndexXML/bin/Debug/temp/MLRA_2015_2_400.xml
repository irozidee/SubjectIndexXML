    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellant was first acquitted and discharged by the High Court due to the prosecution's failure to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case against him on a charge of murder under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. The Public Prosecutor appealed against the acquittal and discharge to the Court of Appeal, which remitted the case to the High Court with an order for the defence to be called. The High Court, on hearing the defence case, found the appellant guilty and sentenced him to death. The appellant thus appealed to the Court of Appeal. At the appeal, counsel submitted that it was crucial to determine: (i) whether it was the deceased victim or the appellant who was armed with the murder weapon - a parang - at the material time; and (ii) whether the appellant had in fact exercised his right of private defence in good faith.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> On the issue who actually had the parang, the trial judge had made a finding of fact that this court found to be unassailable. (para 14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> This court would agree with the finding of the trial judge that the explanation given by the appellant in his defence was unreasonable and improbable as a whole, and that his defence had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case. (para 16)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the trial judge had considered the appellant's defence and was fully conscious of the fact that the defence was one of self-defence. The trial judge had found the appellant's story as being unreasonable and improbable and had rejected the defence of self-defence. This court would agree with the trial judge that in the circumstances and on the facts, the right of self-defence was not available to the appellant. The offence was not committed in self-defence.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Balia Yusof Wahi JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant was charged for murdering one Sellathambi a/l Muniandy under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;302.;;">s 302 of the Penal Code</LINK>. He was acquitted and discharged by the Shah Alam High Court for failure of the prosecution to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case against him.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The Public Prosecutor had appealed against the said order of acquittal and discharge and by an order made on 10 January 2011, the Court of Appeal had remitted the case to the Shah Alam High Court ordering for the defence to be called.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Upon hearing the defence's case, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty and sentenced him to death.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> He now appeals to the Court of Appeal against the said conviction and sentence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> We heard the appeal and we unanimously dismissed the same and affirmed the conviction and sentence passed by the learned High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> We now give our reasons.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The prosecution's evidence against the appellant may be stated as follows. On 30 June 1999 at about 9.15pm, Murugan a/l Muniandy (SP4) had been informed that his brother Kumar had been assaulted by a person named Vijayan. SP4 then together with Kumar and his mother, met Vijayan's father as well as Vijayan at a badminton court where his brother and Vijayan had another fight. SP4 told Vijayan's father that he would be lodging a police report. At about 10.30pm, SP4 approached the deceased to accompany him to the Kuala Selangor Police Station to lodge a report. They went on a motorcycle and the deceased was the rider, whilst SP4 rode as pillion. Suddenly, a motorcycle overtook his motorcycle and blocked him. SP4 recognised the person riding pillion on the overtaking motorcycle as the appellant whom he had known for the past 25-30 years. SP4 could not however identify the rider of that motorcycle. SP4 fell from his machine, felt scared and ran. The deceased also ran. After running for about 200 meters, SP4 heard a loud scream "Aiyooh!". SP4 came back towards the direction where the scream came from and saw the deceased motionless with his face facing downwards and blood on his head. SP4 ran to a sundry shop nearby and informed the people there that the deceased was injured. Together with some people from the sundry shop and the deceased's brother, the deceased was taken to Hospital Tanjung Karang where a post mortem was done revealing 15 injuries on his person. The cause of death was stated to be 'incised wound to the head and neck'.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> Another material witness called by the prosecution was SP6 who testified that while he was playing badminton that night, the appellant approached and informed him that his (the appellant) brother by the name of Selvam had been assaulted by the deceased. After finishing his game, he met the appellant again and they both rode on a motorcycle. He was the rider while the appellant was riding pillion. He was directed by the appellant to take the laterite road towards Bukit Belimbing and saw a motorcycle about 100 meters ahead. The appellant asked him to overtake the motorcycle. According to SP6, he suddenly realized that the appellant was no longer riding pillion with him and he made a U-turn. After making a U-turn, he saw the other motorcycle and upon asking the appellant what happened, the appellant replied that he had assaulted Sellathambi (the deceased) because Sellathambi had assaulted his brother. After that, both SP6 and the appellant went home.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant gave evidence on oath. He called no other witness. He testified that the deceased had assaulted his brother, named Selvam. He intended to meet the deceased and question him in respect of the incident. Accompanied by Kannan (SP6), they went on a motorcycle number PBG 435. He was riding pillion. He met the deceased at Bukit Belimbing River Estate. He could recognised the deceased as the pillion rider of the motorcycle ahead of him. After SP6 overtook SP4's motorcycle, the appellant said he jumped off the motorcycle which he was riding as pillion, and blocked the motorcycle which SP4 was riding, causing SP4's motorcycle to stop. SP4 then fell to the ground and fled leaving his motorcycle at the scene. SP6 also left the appellant there.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant further testified that the deceased had a parang with him. He questioned the deceased why he assaulted his brother. The deceased then attacked him with the parang which he evaded. The deceased, whilst holding the parang, then knocked into the fallen motorcycle and fell. The appellant grabbed the parang from the deceased. The deceased took off his crash helmet and tried to hit him with the crash helmet. The appellant again evaded the deceased's attempt to hit him. In evading the deceased's attack, the parang which he had grabbed from the the deceased, hit the deceased's body about two or three times and the deceased fell to the ground. SP6 then came back and together they went home.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The appellant said he threw the parang in the jungle area. When SP6 asked him where the deceased was, he replied that the deceased was unconscious. When SP6 questioned him why the deceased was assaulted, he replied, it was because the deceased had assaulted his younger brother. Feeling scared, he went to stay in Kuala Lumpur. His mother later called him informing that the police was looking for him. He then contacted the police and was arrested.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The late Mr Karpal Singh learned counsel for the appellant submitted that this is a fit and proper case for a reduction of the charge. The question whether it was the deceased or the appellant who had the parang is very crucial. The appellant gave evidence in his defence about eleven years after the incident. The appellant may have exceeded his right of self defence and the learned trial judge should have amended the charge to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Learned counsel further submitted the case comes under exception 2 of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Learned counsel also informed us that the appellant had made representations to the Attorney General for a reduction of the charge, but was turned down.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> On the issue of who actually had the parang, the learned trial judge had made a finding of fact which we found to be unassailable. We take the liberty to reproduce below what the learned trial judge had found at pp 8 and 9 of her grounds of judgment (pp 42 and 43 of Rekod Rayuan Jilid 3) which stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Further down, the learned trial judge also made a finding that the injuries sustained by the deceased were more consistent with the deceased being hit by a parang from the rear. SP13, the phatologist gave evidence to show that the deceased was hit for 15 times out of which three were at the rear of the deceased's head and neck. This is not consistent with being hit two or three times as claimed by the appellant in his defence. Again, it was admitted by the appellant himself that he threw the parang (exh P24) which was recovered under a heap of oil palm leaves at an oil palm estate.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We agree with the finding of the learned trial judge that the explanation given by the appellant in his defence was unreasonable and improbable as a whole, and that his defence had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Learned counsel referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_415;"><i>Teoh Seng Lian v. PP</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 415</LINK>; [1986] 1 MLJ 474 in his submission on exception 2 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The appellant in Teoh Seng Lian was charged for murder. There had been a business misunderstanding between the appellant and the husband of the deceased. The defence evidence showed that when the appellant asked for a loan of money from the deceased, she refused, scolded and chased him, hitting him with a broom and then throwing a knife at him. The knife missed him and fell to the ground. Both went for the knife but the appellant gained possession of it and slashed her. When she fell on the ground, he picked a stone and hit her on the head. At the trial with a jury, only two types of defence were brought to the attention of the jury by the judge, viz, the exercise of the right of self defence and whether there was grave and sudden provocation. The jury returned a majority verdict of guilty by five to two. The appellant appealed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Supreme Court held that the trial judge in the said case had failed to explain exception 2 of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK> to the jury. Further, the trial judge's direction to the jury on the law relating to the right of private defence was sketchy and inadequate. The conviction on culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the first limb of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304 of the Penal Code</LINK> was recorded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Learned counsel submitted that in the light of the evidence given by the appellant in his defence, it is probable that he exercised the right of private defence in good faith. The learned trial judge, according to counsel, ought to have considered this and reduce the charge to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;304.;;">s 304 of the Penal Code</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We do not find any merit in the submissions. This is a case heard by a judge sitting alone and not with a jury. As a trier of both facts and law, the learned trial judge made such findings and decide on her own. Her Ladyship had considered the appellant's defence and was fully conscious of the fact that the defence was one of self defence. This is apparent from a passage in her grounds of judgment at p 43 of the Rekod Rayuan Jilid 3 which says:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Her Ladyship had found the appellant's story as being unreasonable and improbable and had in effect, rejected the defence of self defence. The issue of addressing her mind on exception 2 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK> therefore does not arise.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The case cited by learned counsel is easily distinguishable from the case before us and is inapplicable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Exception 2 to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1997_574;300.;;">s 300 of the Penal Code</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2015_1_64;"><i>Frans Hiu v. PP</i> [2015] 1 MLRA 64</LINK>; [2014] 9 CLJ 764 which were heard together, this court had an occasion to deal with the law on private defence. The court said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Continuing at para 28 of the judgment, the court futher said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Having considered the facts and circumstances and with the evidence produced in court, we are in agreement with the learned trial judge in finding that the right of private defence was not available to the appellant. Her Ladyship had rightly concluded the offence was not committed in self defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> For the reasons stated above, we found no merit in the appeal and the appeal is dismissed. The conviction and sentence passed by the High Court is affirmed. Our decision is unanimous.</p>
