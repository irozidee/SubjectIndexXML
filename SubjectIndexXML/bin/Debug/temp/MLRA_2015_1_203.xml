    <p>The appellant took out an insurance policy with the respondent in respect of a shipment of 7,350,615 metric tonnes of coal for a voyage from South Kalimantan, Indonesia to Kuching, Sarawak. The insured amount was USD792,000 and the policy was an "all risks" policy. It was found that the quality of the coal had changed upon arrival at the Kuching port in Sarawak and failed to meet the specifications stated in the purchase order concerned. The appellant then claimed under the insurance policy for the damage. The respondent rejected the claim based on the report of its commissioned surveyor that the coal could have absorbed moisture at some stage during transit, thereby resulting in the damage which was classified as "inherent vice" and not covered under the policy. The appellant then brought its claim to the High Court. The High Court dismissed the claim, resulting in the present appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The relevant reports on the quality of the coal showed conclusively that there was a change in its quality during voyage. That change in quality in the absence of any allegations of bad faith or fraud against the appellant was enough to show that a fortuitous event, casualty and/or accident caused the loss. Hence the appellant had discharged the burden of proof, and with that, the burden shifted to the respondent to prove that the change in the quality of coal was caused by "inherent vice" not covered under the policy. (para 26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondent's witness was not an expert on coal and was only an insurance adjuster. The respondent therefore did not produce any evidence to prove its case. In view of that failure on the part of the respondent, the appellant had successfully proved its claim on a balance of probability and was entitled to compensation under the insurance policy.

      <b>David Wong Dak Wah JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal by the appellant/plaintiff against the decision of the High Court in which the learned judge dismissed a marine insurance claim against the respondent/defendant for loss of cargoes damaged during the voyage from Indonesia to Sarawak.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard the appeal and after giving due consideration to the evidence adduced in the trial court and submissions by respective counsel, we allowed the appeal and now give our grounds for that decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The appellant took out an insurance policy in respect of a shipment of 7,350,615 metric tonnes of steam bulk coal (coal) for a voyage from S Suai, South Kalimantan, Indonesia to Kuching. The insured amount is USD792,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The crucial term of the insurance policy for this appeal is that of cl 1 which provides for all risks of loss or damage to the coal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Prior to the shipment from Indonesia, a survey report was commissioned and the report confirmed that the quality of the coal complied with the specification of the purchase order and that the quantity was 7,350,615 metric tonnes. PT SGS Indonesia did the survey report.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Upon arrival at the Kuching port on 17 April 2010, another survey was commissioned and the report stated that the quality and quantity of the coal were different from that of the report done in Indonesia and hence did not comply with the specification of the purchase order. Particulars of the differences are not disputed and they are as set out in the submission of learned counsel for the appellant:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The aforesaid report was done by SGS (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (SGS).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In view of these differences, the coal had become useless for use to the appellant in that the quality of the coal that had arrived in Kuching was inferior than the specifications stated in the purchase order. The use of the coal by the appellant is for fuel burning at the clinker plant at Mambong without the need of mixing with other coal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> To comply with the terms of the insurance policy for the purpose of making a claim, the appellant on 5 May 2010 lodged a police report of the variance of the two commissioned reports. The appellant also informed the respondent on 4 May 2010 of the just mentioned differences of the two reports and also made the claim on the policy. SGS was also informed of the differences.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> Upon being informed, SGS did another survey on 5 May 2010 by way of comparison between the two reports and came to this conclusion:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The respondent in response to the appellant's claim on the insurance policy commissioned another surveyor by the name of Kasi Marine-Technical Inspection Sdn Bhd on 21 May 2010 which in substance found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Premised on that report, the respondent through its broker on 10 June 2010 rejected the appellant's claim on the following ground:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The appellant attempted to mitigate the damage by using the coal through mixing the same with other high grade coals but however did not work in that the fuel did not produce enough heat to cook the raw materials. The appellant expended an amount of RM957,713.02 through this attempt to utilise the low grade coal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The dispute was resolved by the High Court which on 17 August 2012 dismissed the appellant's claim and this appeal concerns that dismissal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Grounds</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The learned judge in our view had framed the determinative issue correctly in this dispute and that was:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was undisputed by parties that the insurance policy is an 'all risks' policy. The relevant clause reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Before the learned judge, the respondent's position was basically that even though it is an all risk policy that does not mean it covers any kind of risk. There must be elements of "fortuity or casualty ". That contention is premised on the dicta found in <i>British and Foreign Marine Insurance Co v. Gaunt</i> [1921] All ER 447 where the House of Lords state as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant took the position that the burden of proof is discharged once it is shown that the loss was caused by a casualty or something accidental or unforeseen without the need to prove the exact nature of the casualty or accident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The learned judge concurred with the respondent's stand and then discussed in detail whether the appellant had discharged the burden of proving that the loss was due to accident or fortuity. The learned judge found that there was no proof of theft or switching during the voyage on the ground that the amount of transported coal was no small amount. There was also no evidence of bad weather or adverse sea condition which had caused the damage to the coal. Further he also relied on the evidence of PW1 who was not able to say what had caused the change to quality of the coal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The learned judge's rationale can be seen from this paragraph from his judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In our view the appropriate starting point of deliberation for such claim is the policy cover itself. As pointed out above, the insurance policy is an 'all-risks' policy and what that means in terms of burden of proof is set out in the following cases and commentaries.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In the case of <i>British and Foreign Marine Insurance Co Ltd v. Gaunt (supra)</i> the House of Lords held at p 58 that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The same sentiments are reflected in <i>Law of Marine Insurance</i> (1996 edn), Susan Hodges, where the learned author states:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> In <i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> (4th edn Reissue), vol 25 at para 150, the same sentiments are expressed:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned author in Marine Policy, JK Goodacre on "<i>Marine Insurance</i>" at p 123 defined 'all risks' policy as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Applying the above principle, we are of the considered view that the appellant had discharged the burden of proof and our reasons are these. The comparative analysis performed by SGS, which can be found in pp 204-206 of record of appeal - Part C and the evidence of PW2 were wrongly rejected by the learned judge. The learned judge erred on this rejection as he failed to acknowledge that PW2's evidence is consistent to that of the reports of SGS, which have not been rebutted by the respondent. Further, PW2's evidence was rejected by the learned judge on the ground that he had no academic qualification. That with respect is incorrect as a witness can attain their expertise through his or her experience in that area of expertise. PW2 is a coal mine developer and an international coal trader for some 16 years in Indonesia and Australia. Suffice for us to refer to the dicta contained in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_137;"><i>Public Prosecutor v. Muhamad Sulaiman</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 137</LINK>; [1982] 2 MLJ 320; [1982] CLJ 292, where the Federal Court held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> It is undisputed that the comparative report of SGS and its earlier report on the coal show conclusively that there has been a change in the quality of the coal. This change in quality, and in the absence of any allegations of bad faith or fraud against the appellant in their claim by the respondent, in our view, is enough to show that the loss had been caused by a fortuitous event and/or casualty and/or accident. Hence the appellant had discharged the burden of proof and with that, the burden then shifted to the respondent to prove that the change in the quality of coal was due to 'inherent vice' of the coals. In simple language, we found that the appellant had proven their case and to escape liability, the respondent who had asserted that the coal's deterioration was due to 'inherent vice' must bear that burden of proof to so prove, as required under the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We are aware of the contention that the change in the quality of the coal could have been caused by absorption of moisture during the journey and that was the 'inherent vice' according to the respondent. This contention was rejected by the learned judge and in our view rightly so. The respondent's witness is not an expert on coal and was only an insurance adjuster. Simply put, the respondent had not produced any evidence to prove their case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In view of this failure on the part of the respondent, we find that the appellant had successfully proved their claim on a balance of probability and is entitled to compensation due under the insurance policy.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The learned judge though not necessary so to do, had found that damage has been proved and this can be seen in this paragraph of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant, there was no cross appeal by the respondent, this part of the judgment remained unchallenged. In any event we opined that the learned judge gave a correct analysis of the law and fact on the issue of damage.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> During submission, learned counsel for the appellant informed us that he was not pursuing the claim of blending costs of RM957,713.02. That being the case that part of the judgment remained.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> It can be said that this case was resolved by determining who bore the burden of proof and how and when that burden shifted. In this case the appellant bore the primary burden of proving their case that the loss of the coal was due to a fortuitous event and/or accident and/or casualty. The appellant did that by proving that the quality of the coal was not the same as when the coal was boarded in indonesia. Once proven that burden shifted for the respondent to prove that there was 'inherent vice' in the coal. That the respondent failed to discharge the <i>onus</i> that was on the learned judge.</p>
    <p>Accordingly and premised on our analysis above, we allowed the appeal. Further we had set aside the judgment of the High Court and awarded damages as in para 13 (i) and (v) of statement of claim, with interest of 5% per annum from 7 June 2010 till full payment. We also awarded costs for here and below to the appellant in the sum of RM 70,000 and further ordered that the deposit to be refunded to the appellant. 210</p>
