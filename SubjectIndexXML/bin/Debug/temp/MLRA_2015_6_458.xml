    <p>The appellant/defendant, a housing developer, awarded a contract to the respondent/plaintiff to construct single storey terrace houses in Perak. The respondent commenced construction works and was paid in two progress payments with the understanding that the balance of payments due to the respondent would be set off against payments made by the appellant to Syarikat WLS Construction Sdn Bhd, the supplier of building materials to the respondent. The appellant was dissatisfied with the delay in the progress of the construction works and proceeded to terminate the contract vide a notice of termination. The respondent claimed the sum of RM306,544.84 being the balance of payments due and the cost of materials left on site. The appellant maintained that the termination of the contract was proper and lawful as the progress of works by the respondent was not in accordance with the agreed time schedule. The appellant in their counterclaim alleged that part of the works completed by the respondent was defective and the appellant had to appoint another contractor, Meng Seng Builders ('MSB') to carry out remedial works and to complete the respondent's scope of works ('the uncompleted works'). After a full trial the respondent's claim was allowed in part for the sum being the balance amount owing by the appellant. The appellant's counterclaim was dismissed on the ground that the appellant had failed to prove that it had in fact paid the cost to MSB for remedial works and for completing the uncompleted works. The appellant filed this appeal against the order dismissing the counterclaim. The issue in contention in this appeal was whether payment to MSB by the appellant was actually necessary before the appellant could claim against the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner erred in arriving at the conclusion that he did for the following reasons: (i) it was not disputed by the respondent that it had not completed the works as alleged by the appellant; (ii) it was not the pleaded case of the respondent that the defective and uncompleted works were not attended to and completed by MSB. In fact in his submission, the respondent conceded that both the works had been completed but just that there was no evidence of payments; (iii) there were ample evidence adduced by the appellant to prove that the defective works were carried out by MSB, and (iv) there were equally ample evidence adduced by the appellant to prove that the uncompleted works were in fact carried out and completed by MSB. The reasonable conclusion was that the appellant must have paid the respective sums, although there was an absence of invoices, payment vouchers and the like to show that MSB had been paid. (paras 21-22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> It was important to note that the quantity surveyors report ('exh P3') was tendered not by the appellant but by the respondent, being an agreed document. This showed that the respondent had accepted the fact that it would cost the appellant an additional sum of RM974,400.00 to carry out the uncompleted works. The respondent could not now be seen to resile from this fact and concession. (para 21)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Once the new contractor had performed its part of the contract it was incumbent on the appellant to pay. The liability of the appellant to pay would arise immediately upon the new contractor completing its work and any delay in payment would in fact amount to a debt due and owing by the appellant to the new contractor. As the respondent was in breach of the contract it behoved the respondent to reimburse the appellant the moment the appellant's liability arose that is, when MSB had completed its work and not only after MSB had submitted its bills and the appellant had paid them. (paras 26-27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> A perusal of the search results on MSB issued by Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia showed that MSB was a sole proprietorship and the sole proprietor was Chew Chee Seng. The legal entity in this case was Chew Chee Seng, an individual, while MSB was the business name. There was no issue of the appellant contracting with a non-legal entity. In any event the issue of 'legal entity' was not pleaded by the respondent in the statement of claim and neither was it an agreed issue to be tried by the trial judge. It was a non-issue as far as the respondent was concerned and it was incorrect for the trial judge to rely on it as a ground to hold that the appellant had not proved its case on a balance of probabilities.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mah Weng Kwai JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 25 October 2010, the appellant/defendant, a housing developer, awarded a contract to the respondent/plaintiff to construct 53 units of single storey terrace houses in Klebang Sanctuary, Mukim Hulu Kinta, Perak.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The lump sum contract price was RM2,866,000 with the period for completion being six months from the date of the notice to commence works.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The respondent commenced construction works and was paid the sum of RM91,347.00 in two progress payments with the understanding that the balance of payments due to the respondent would be set off against the payments made by the appellant to Syarikat WLS Construction Sdn Bhd, the supplier of building materials to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The appellant was dissatisfied with the delay in the progress of the construction works by the respondent and proceeded to terminate the contract vide the notice of termination issued on 28 January 2011 (exh D6).</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Respondent's Claim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The respondent denied that there was any delay in the performance of the contract and averred that the termination of the contract by the appellant was not lawful.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The respondent claimed the sum of RM306,544.84 being made up of the balance of payments due and the cost of materials left on site.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appellant's Defence And Counterclaim</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant maintained that the termination of the contract was proper and lawful as the progress of works by the respondent was not in accordance with the agreed time schedule set out in the letter dated 28 December 2010 as pleaded in para 7 of the statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The appellant denied that there was any outstanding balance payment due to the respondent and averred to the contrary, that they had overpaid the sum of RM5,416.36 after taking into account the sums paid to WLS Construction Sdn Bhd for the materials supplied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The appellant in their counterclaim alleged that part of the works completed by the respondent were defective and the appellant had to appoint another contractor Meng Seng Builders (MSB) to carry out the remedial works. The sum claimed by the appellant for the defection works done was RM70,686.36.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The appellant also complained that the respondent had failed to complete the scope of works within time and was compelled to appoint MSB to complete the respondent's scope of works (the uncompleted works). The sum claimed by the appellant for the construction of uncompleted works was RM974,400.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> After a full trial the learned Judicial Commissioner allowed the respondent's claim in part only that is, for the sum of RM14,330.00 being the balance amount owing by the appellant. The learned Judicial Commissioner held that of the total sum of RM286,600.00 owing being the value of works completed by the respondent, the sum of RM91,347.50 had been paid directly to the respondent and the sum of RM180,922.50 had been paid to Syarikat WLS Construction Sdn Bhd thereby leaving a balance sum of RM14,330.00 only.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner had dismissed the appellant's counterclaim in its entirety solely on the ground that the appellant had failed to prove that it had in fact paid the cost for remedial works and for completing the uncompleted works to MSB.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Being dissatisfied with the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner, the appellant filed its Notice of Appeal against part of the said decision namely, against the order dismissing the counterclaim but not against the order to pay the sum of RM14,330.00 to the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It will be noted here that the respondent did not file a cross-appeal against the decision allowing the respondent the sum of RM14,330.00 only, the reason being as stated by counsel for the respondent that the respondent agreed with the finding and decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner even though the judgment sum awarded was much lower than the original amount claimed by the respondent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> Upon reading the Record of Appeal, the written submissions of counsel for the appellant and the respondent and upon hearing the oral submissions of counsel aforesaid, the court unanimously allowed the appeal by the appellant on the counterclaim with costs as prayed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The respondent now applies for leave to appeal to the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner in his grounds of judgment held that the termination of the contract pursuant to cl 12 therein, by the appellant vide its letter of termination of 28 January 2011, was lawful. This meant that the learned Judicial Commissioner had accepted that the respondent was in breach in the performance of the contract by reason of the defective works and uncompleted works and as the respondent did not cross-appeal against this finding, this also meant that the respondent had accepted the finding of liability for the breach of the contract.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> While the learned Judicial Commissioner accepted that there were defective works and uncompleted works outstanding as on 28 January 2011 and that the appellant had a valid cause of action (see Grounds of Judgment - Rekod Rayuan p 31 at para 28), His Lordship nonetheless dismissed the appellant's counterclaim solely on the ground that the appellant had failed to prove that it had paid MSB the cost for carrying out the remedial and uncompleted works.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In para 40 of the Grounds of Judgment (Rekod Rayuan p 20) the learned Judicial Commissioner held and we quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It would appear from para 40 that the learned Judicial Commissioner had no issue on whether the defective and uncompleted works were in fact attended to and completed but rather was at pains to state that there were no evidence by way of invoices, receipts or other documents to show that MSB had been paid for its work.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> We are respectfully of the view that the learned Judicial Commissioner erred in arriving at the conclusion that he did for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Significantly, it is important to note that exh P3 was tendered not by the appellant but by the respondent, being an agreed document. This clearly showed that the respondent had accepted the fact that it would cost the appellant an additional sum of RM974,400.00 to carry out the uncompleted works. The respondent cannot now be seen to resile from this fact and concession. It is trite that once a document is agreed upon without qualification, the authenticity of the document and the contents stated therein are no longer in dispute.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Being satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the defective and uncompleted works were in fact carried out by MSB, we are equally satisfied with the reasonable conclusion that the appellant must have paid MSB the respective sums, although there is an absence of invoices, payment vouchers and the likes to show that MSB had been paid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> We are satisfied that when considering the evidence of SD1, SD2 and SD3 read together with the documentary evidence (the quantity surveyor's report (exh P3) the award of contract for the defective works (exh D10A and D10B) and the award of the contract for the uncompleted works (exh D11) and taken as a whole, there was sufficient evidence adduced by the appellant to prove the counterclaim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Central to the arguments in this appeal was not whether the defective and uncompleted works were in fact attended to and completed but rather whether the appellant had paid MSB the cost for completing the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Unless there was an allegation of conspiracy to defraud the respondent hatched between the appellant and MSB, which most certainly was not the respondent's pleaded case, we cannot possibly see how MSB could or would have completed the project without having been paid. Commercial realty dictates that no contractor in his right mind will carry out any construction works at great cost without payment. At the expense of repetition, it is important to remember that in this case, counsel for the respondent had conceded that the works had been completed before the conclusion of the trial before the learned Judicial Commissioner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Once the new contractor had performed its part of the contract it was incumbent on the appellant to pay. The liability of the appellant to pay would arise immediately upon the new contractor completing its work and any delay in payment would in fact amount a debt due and owing by the appellant to the new contractor.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As the respondent was in breach of the contract it behoved the respondent to reimburse the appellant the moment the appellant's liability arose that is, when MSB had completed its work and not only after MSB had submitted its bills and the appellant had paid them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> In <i>Contractual Duties: Performance, Breach, Termination and Remedies (The Contract Law Library)</i> by Professor Neil Andrews <i>et al</i>, 2011 edn, in para 21 - 118 at p 420 it was stated that "if a breach causes the claimant to incur a legal liability to a third party and pay it, then (assuming the loss is not too remote) that is no difficulty: the liability is clearly an admissible head of damages". In our case, it is clear that due to a breach of contract by the respondent, the appellant by appointing MSB to attend to the defective and uncompleted works had incurred a legal liability to pay to MSB, the third party, a head of damage which was not too remote.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The essential issue to be determined by the court was whether payment to MSB by the appellant was actually necessary before the appellant could claim against the respondent. Taking for a moment that the appellant had not paid MSB in part or at all, we are of the view that where the liability has not been discharged yet but it is clear that it will be then it is trite that the appellant can sue the respondent for recovery (see <i>Randall v. Raper</i> [1858] EB &amp; E 84). It is not open to the respondent to argue that the action is premature or that the appellant cannot sue to recover the loss in the absence of any evidence that the appellant has actually paid MSB to discharge its obligation.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> In the final analysis, we are of the view that the finding of legal liability against the respondent was enough to ground a claim for damages (see <i>Total Liban SA v. Vitol Energy SA</i> [2001] QB 643). In any event the respondent's case was not that there was no liability on the part of the appellant to pay MSB but just that there was no evidence of any payments.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> A further issue that needs mention was whether MSB was a properly registered business as on 10 March 2011, the date of the award of the contract by the appellant. The learned Judicial Commissioner held in para 42 of his grounds of judgment that as MSB was only registered on 24 March 2011, it was clear that the appellant had contracted with an entity which was then not in existence and drew an adverse inference that there were no supporting documents between the appellant and MSB to support the appellant's claim. Respectfully, we are of the view that the learned Judicial Commissioner had clearly erred when he made that inference. A perusal of exh P14, the search results on MSB issued by Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia showed that MSB is a sole proprietorship and the sole proprietor is Chew Chee Seng, SD3. The legal entity in this case is Chew Chee Seng, an individual, while MSB is the business name. There was no issue of the appellant contracting with a non-legal entity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> In any event it must not be overlooked that the issue of "legal entity" was not pleaded by the respondent in the statement of claim and neither was it an agreed issue to be tried by the learned Judicial Commissioner. It was a non-issue as far as the respondent was concerned and it was incorrect for the learned Judicial Commissioner to rely on it as a ground to hold that the appellant had not proved its case on a balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In the result the appeal was allowed with costs of RM10,000.00 here and below. The deposit was ordered to be refunded.</p>
