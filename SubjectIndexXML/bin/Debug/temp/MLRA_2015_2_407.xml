    <p>The respondent, a "Pegawai Tadbir dan Diplomatik Gred M44", was found under two charges to have breached <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1993_395;4.;;">r 4(2)(g) Public Officers (Conduct and Discipline) Regulations 1993</LINK> and accordingly was demoted from Gred M44 to Gred M41 by the appellant. Consequently, the respondent filed a judicial review application in the High Court against the decision of the appellant. The issues raised by the respondent were: whether the respondent had been given a fair hearing in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2) Federal Constitution ("FC")</LINK>; whether the appellant failed to act reasonably; whether the appellant had examined and considered accurately the respondent's representation letter; and whether the decision of the appellant was fair, just and not <i>ultra vires</i>. The High Court, referring to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2) FC</LINK>, allowed the respondent's application on the ground that the appellant had failed to provide the respondent a right to an oral hearing. Hence, the instant appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It was clear that the right under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2) FC</LINK> to a reasonable opportunity of being heard was not synonymous with a right to an oral hearing, which should be granted according to the circumstances of each case. Further, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2) FC</LINK> spoke of being given a reasonable opportunity of being heard, but did not specify that it must be an oral hearing. Following that, GO 26(5) of the Public Officers (Conduct and Discipline) (Chapter D) General Orders 1980 ("GO 26(5)") provided that an oral hearing would only be granted if the appropriate disciplinary authority considered that the case against the officer required further clarification. Therefore, GO 26(5) did not support the reasoning that by virtue of GO 26(5), the officer should be afforded an oral hearing to satisfy the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2) FC</LINK>. (<i>Ang Seng Wan v. Suruhanjaya Polis Di Raja Malaysia &amp; Anor (folld)</i>; <i>Mat Ghaffar Baba v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Anor (folld)</i>; <i>Yusof Sudin v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Polis &amp; Anor (folld)</i>). (paras 8-13)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, upon a perusal of the respondent's representation letter, there were no reasons set out to form any basis for the request letter for an oral preliminary hearing. Thus, no basis was demonstrated which necessitated a preliminary oral hearing in order to complete the respondent's representations over and above what she had put in writing in her letter. Accordingly, there was no reason why the High Court came to the conclusion that the circumstances of the instant case were such that an oral hearing should have been given. Hence, the High Court had erred in allowing the respondent's application for judicial review. (paras 14-18)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Wahab Patail JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Awam appealed against the decision of the High Court to allow the application for judicial review by the respondent Hajah Marina Haji Mustafa, and thereby setting aside the decision of the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appeal centred upon the right to be heard as enshrined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> on restriction on dismissal and reduction in rank as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In this case, the respondent, a "Pegawai Tadbir dan Diplomatik Gred M44" was found under two charges to have breached <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1993_395;4.;;">Peraturan 4(2)(g) Peraturan- Peraturan Pegawai Awam (Kelakuan dan Tatatertib) 1993</LINK> and accordingly was demoted from Gred M44 to Gred M41.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> As summed up by the High Court, the four issues raised were whether:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> In its grounds of judgment and referring to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2)</LINK>, the High Court stated that the respondent's application was allowed for the reason:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> According to the grounds of judgment, the High Court had referred itself to various cases including <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_3_60;"><i>Mat Ghaffar Baba v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Anor</i> [2007] 3 MLRA 60</LINK>; [2008] 2 MLJ 1; [2008] 1 CLJ 773.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> In <i>Mat Ghaffar Baba v. Ketua Polis Negara &amp; Anor (supra)</i>, the appellant had requested that in the event that his explanation is deemed insufficient to exculpate himself from those charges he prayed that an oral hearing be given to him to enable him to cross-examine all witnesses that had implicated him in the alleged wrong doings and further he requested for all evidence/proof be made available to him in view of the seriousness of the charges and the penalty that may follow. It was held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It is clear that the right under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2)</LINK> to a reasonable opportunity of being heard is not synonymous with a right to an oral hearing, which should be granted according to the circumstances of the case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_3_637;"><i>Yusof Sudin v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Polis &amp; Anor</i> [2012] 3 MLRA 637</LINK>; [2011] 5 MLJ 465; [2012] 1 CLJ 448, the Federal Court by majority decision held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The words used, that "... the officer should be afforded an oral hearing to satisfy the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2)</LINK> ..." warrant attention for the reason that the words "should be" were used rather than "must be".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> We observed further that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2)</LINK> speaks of being given a reasonable opportunity of being heard, but did not specify it must be an oral hearing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Furthermore, O 26(5) of the General Orders 1980 referred to, provided only as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> It is clear that the majority accepted that <i>Ang Seng Wan</i> and <i>Mat Ghaffar</i> have laid down the principle and the clear situation as to when the Disciplinary Committee should convene an oral hearing. Therefore, since O 26(5) refers to a case where the Appropriate Disciplinary Authority considered that the case against the officer requires further clarification, it does not support the reasoning that "... by virtue of O 26(5) of the General Orders 1980, the officer should be afforded an oral hearing to satisfy the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;135.;;">art 135(2)</LINK>" except in cases where representations having been made, the Appropriate Disciplinary Authority considered further clarification to be necessary. Then, obviously to give opportunity for the officer to find out what the further clarification is that was necessary and the reasons why before he answers it, an oral hearing at that stage would expedite matters and was therefore warranted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In this case, the appellant had issued a show cause letter dated 17 August 2009 to inform the respondent that the appellant had decided to pursue disciplinary action pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1993_395;35.;;">reg 35 of the Public Officers (Conduct and Discipline) Regulations 1993</LINK> against her with a view to dismissal or reduction in rank, the two grounds relied upon and that the respondent was given 21 days to submit her written representation to exculpate herself. Her representation was given under a cover letter dated 7 September 2009 where she stated:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> We perused her 50 pages representation to appreciate as to why an oral preliminary hearing was needed. It was very detailed and specific. We found no reasons set out to form any basis for the request in the cover letter for an oral preliminary hearing. Instead, her representation simply concluded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> We concluded that no basis was demonstrated for the necessity for a preliminary oral hearing in order to complete her representations over and above what she had put in writing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Returning to the grounds of judgment of the High Court, we found no reason set out as to why the High Court came to the conclusion that the circumstances of the case were such that an oral hearing should have been given.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We, therefore, concluded that the High Court had no reasons why an oral hearing should be granted as requested, and that it had erred in allowing the respondent's application for judicial review on the ground that an oral hearing ought to have been granted. We allowed the appeal with no order as to costs.</p>
