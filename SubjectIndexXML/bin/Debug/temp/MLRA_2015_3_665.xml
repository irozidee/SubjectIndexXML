    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>This was the appellant's appeal against the dismissal of his application to amend his defence of justification to include a "lesser/lower defamatory meaning" and a plea of "partial justification" ('the proposed amended defence'), pursuant to a defamation action filed by the respondent against the appellant in respect of certain remarks made by the appellant during a political speech ('impugned statement'). In the proposed amended defence, the appellant sought to justify his plea of partial justification by relying on the decision of the Federal Court which acquitted the respondent for sodomy and a subsequent judgment in which the respondent was convicted for another charge for sodomy. On the other hand, the respondent opposed the appellant's proposed amended defence, <i>inter alia</i>, for the following reasons: the appellant failed to state the meaning he sought to justify in the proposed amended defence; the purported particulars in the proposed amended defence did not amount to facts which supported the allegation that the impugned statement was true as required by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court 2012 ('ROC')</LINK>; and the proposed plea of 'partial justification' was wrong, improper and inapplicable as the words the respondent complained of referred only to one charge and not several charges, and accordingly the appellant could not rely on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;8.;;">s 8 of the Defamation Act 1957 ('the Act')</LINK> to justify the proposed amended defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (appeal dismissed with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant appeal, the appellant was evasive and did not provide any clear answer when asked as to what meaning he had attributed to the impugned statement with regard to the character or standing of the respondent. It was crucial for the appellant to be clear and precise as to the meaning that he attributed to the impugned statement which was different from the meaning understood by the respondent. Instead the appellant went on a frolic of his own by stating all the particulars in the proposed amended defence, particulars of which were not helpful to the respondent to understand the exact alternative meaning which the appellant had attributed to the impugned statement. Hence, the particulars which the appellant provided in the proposed amended defence did not meet the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(2) of the ROC</LINK>. (paras 30-32)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;8.;;">Section 8 of the Act</LINK> spoke of more than one charge in an impugned statement. In this instance, the responded was complaining only of one defamatory meaning of the impugned statement. Therefore, the appellant's argument that he could rely on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;8.;;">s 8 of the Act</LINK> to justify the amendment of partial justification was misconceived. (<i>Polly Peck (Holdings) Plc &amp; Others v. Trelford &amp; Others (folld)</i>). (para 34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The Federal Court decision referred to by the appellant was impermissible and contrary to the clear terms of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>, as the passage referred to by the appellant in that judgment was not an issue here. In this appeal, the issue was not about the guilt or otherwise of the respondent on the charge of sodomy but whether or not the impugned statement was defamatory of the respondent. Furthermore, the Federal Court case was not between the same parties as in this appeal. Thus, it was immaterial whether the respondent was subsequently convicted of another charge of sodomy which charge and conviction was found well after the appellant made the impugned statement and which was not in any way related to the Federal Court decision. (para 36)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The general rule with regard to amendments was that the court should lean towards allowing amendments to be made to the pleadings to make them clear and to put before the court all the material facts on the issue or issues that required the court's determination. However, the court's discretion to do so must be exercised judiciously. The court must be satisfied that the proposed amendments had passed all the legal requirements and were not prejudicial to the party against whom the amendments were to be made. In the instant appeal, the proposed amended defence did not state clearly and precisely the lesser meaning or any indication of what was the lesser meaning that was attributed to the impugned statement. Thus, the respondent was prejudiced. Accordingly, the proposed amended defence was not tenable in the circumstances of this case as it was not <i>bona fide</i>. (para 37)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> On 7 March 2008, the plaintiff (the respondent in this appeal) filed this defamation action against the defendant (the appellant in this appeal) in respect of certain remarks made by the defendant during a political speech on 20 February 2008 at Lembah Pantai, Kuala Lumpur. During the speech, the defendant uttered the words "DAP main PAS dari kanan, PAS main DAP dari kiri, Anwar main dua-dua dari belakang", which the plaintiff contends is defamatory of him. The defendant has, through his lawyer's letter dated 6 March 2008 in response to the plaintiff's letter of demand, admitted uttering the impugned words.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> At the material time in February 2008, the plaintiff was the advisor to Parti Keadilan Rakyat Malaysia, and the defendant, the Deputy Youth Chief of the Youth Wing of UMNO.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The defendant filed his defence on 21 October 2010 relying, <i>inter alia</i>, on the defences of justification, qualified privilege and estoppels. </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> An order precluding the defendant from defending the action was made on 13 August 2012 due to the defendant's failure to comply with an Unless Order made by the court during case management directions ("the Preclusion Order"). The defendant failed in his bid to set aside the Preclusion Order in the High Court but succeeded before the Court of Appeal on 21 June 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> All preliminaries and pre-trial procedures have been completed; and the case has been fixed for hearing for two days in November and two days in December 2013. In compliance with case management directions, the plaintiff has filed the Bundle of Pleadings, Bundles of Documents, Statement of Agreed Facts, Statement of Issues to be Tried, List of Witnesses and Case Summary. Witness Statements are due to be filed and exchanged on or before 14 November 2013.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The defendant now, seeks to amend his defence of justification to include a "lesser/lower defamatory meaning" and a plea of "partial justification".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The draft amended defence is exhibited to defendant's application. They read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The plaintiff opposed the defendant's proposed amendments to the defence, <i>inter alia</i>, on the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Principles Governing Amendments</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The principles governing amendments to pleadings are found in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;20;SN5.;;">O 20 r 5 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> and as elaborated in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1982_1_417;"><i>Yamaha Motor Co Ltd v. Yamaha (M) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1982] 1 MLRA 417</LINK>; [1983] 1 MLJ 213; [1983] CLJ 428. To state briefly amendments may be made at any stage of proceedings. Allowing the amendments is entirely at the discretion of the court. The general principle is that the court will allow such amendments that will not cause injustice to the other party; and if there is prejudice whether the prejudice cause to the other side can be compensated by cost. The court also will have to consider whether the amendments would not in any effect turn the suit from one character into another and of inconsistent character. The court will also have to consider whether the application to amend is made <i>bona fide</i>. Bearing in mind these principles, we will now consider the submissions by the parties.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Submissions By Appellant/Defendant</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Firstly, the defendant submitted that the amendments are proper and in accordance with the law. It was submitted that it was misconceived for the plaintiff to argue that the proposed amendments are not in accordance with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN2.;;">O 78 r 2 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. This is because the particulars of justification that has been furnished in para 11 of the Proposed Amended Defence includes the meaning which the defendant ascribed the words that are complained of. The proposed amendments in the said para 11 are not merely narratives of the events but it also rendered "the lesser meaning" which the defendant attributed to the impugned words. This, according to learned counsel for the defendant can be seen from para 11(iv) and (v) of the Proposed Amended Defence by the defendant. It was submitted that even if the court found that the particulars given were inadequate or non existence to render "the lesser meaning". The High Court should not dismiss the application to amend but allow the application, giving the defendant a chance to make the proposed amendments on condition that the particulars were said to be lacking are pleaded in the amended defence that is ultimately filed in respect of the action.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> It was further submitted by learned counsel for the defendant that the High Court was wrong to rule that the proposed amended plea of partial justification should not be allowed because there was only one meaning that have been attributed by the plaintiff in the statement of claim. It was argued that reading the whole statement of claim by the plaintiff it is clear that there was more than one meaning attributed by the plaintiff to the alleged defamatory statement by the defendant. The defendant contended that the statement of claim by the plaintiff is capable of the following distinct meanings: (a) the plaintiff facing charges on homosexual conduct or activity; (b) questioning the plaintiff's suitability to hold political office; (c) the plaintiff has criminal tendencies; and (d) the plaintiff was dangerous to Malaysian society. It was submitted that the proposed amendments were to introduce the issue of the <i>ratio</i> and observation of the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court in the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_634;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 634</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 737; [2004] 3 CLJ 737; [2004] 5 AMR 265 as to the plaintiff's character as being cogent evidence that the plaintiff had a general reputation for being homosexual in mitigation of damages for libel. It was argued that this evidence should be admissible. It was further argued that the observation made by the Federal Court was not irrelevant and formed part of the considered judgment. This is because the plaintiff had taken out a separate proceeding to have a particular observation by the Federal Court in the said judgment struck out from the judgment. But the plaintiff failed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> With regard to the proposed amendments to the defendant's statement of defence to include the conviction of the plaintiff for sodomy by the Court of Appeal which reversed the order of acquittal by the High Court on appeal by the Public Prosecutor to the Court of Appeal; and which conviction was affirmed by the Federal Court resulting in the plaintiff being sentenced to five years imprisonment, it was submitted that this fact of conviction was not in evidence at the time when the application to amend the statement of defence was filed by the defendant in the High Court. It was submitted that this amendment should be allowed to support the defendant's defence of full and partial justification on the basis of that conviction. It was further submitted that this court has wide powers and in fact all the powers of the High Court Judge at the time of hearing of the application to amend, to allow this amendment by virtue of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;24.;;">s 24A</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1964_91;67.;;">s 67 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964</LINK>, without the need for the defendant to make further application before the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> With regard to the issue of delay, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the application to amend is <i>bona fide</i>. Furthermore, the purpose is not to derail the proceeding but to put all the material facts before the court. In any event it was submitted that if there is prejudice or hardship caused to the plaintiff by the amendments, the plaintiff can be compensated by cost for the hardship or the prejudice. It was also argued that the delay in this case is insufficient ground in itself to refuse leave to amend unless there is hardship or prejudice caused to the plaintiff, which the defendant submitted there was none. It was pointed out to us that the application for the amendments had been made months before the date fixed for trial. Citing the case of <i>Wright Norman &amp; Anor v. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</i> [1994] 1 SLR 513, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that justice in this case demands that the proposed amendments be allowed and that pleading must not be used as a means to punish a party for his errors or the errors of the solicitors. Without the amendments, it is said that the true facts underlying the issues between the parties would not be properly put before the court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Respondent/Plaintiff's Submission</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that to plead justification, the defendant must state clearly and precisely the meaning or meanings the defendant attributed to the impugned defamatory words without obfuscation. To support this proposition, learned counsel referred to <i>Morrell v. International Thomson Publishing Ltd &amp; Ors</i> [1989] 3 All ER 733. It was further submitted that if the defendant disagrees with the meaning of the impugned words prescribed by the plaintiff, the defendant may give an alternative defamatory meaning and give particulars to justify that meaning. This is known as "the <i>Lucas-Box</i>" meaning. This concept is taken from the case of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Lucas-Box v. News Group Newspapers Ltd</i> [1986] 1 All ER 177, where the English Court of Appeal said that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In another case <i>Stephen Foley &amp; 2 Ors v. Lord Ashcroft KCMG</i> [2012] EWCA Civ 423, the English Court of Appeal also refused to allow the proposed amendments to the defence of justification which were insufficiently clear and imprecise. In <i>Elaine Chase v. Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 1772, the court said that if the particulars pleaded to justify the meaning prescribed to the alleged defamatory words ascribed by the defendant seeking to justify the meaning are not clear then the situation must be made unequivocally clear. In other words, the defendant in such situation must then give proper particulars of the facts on which the defendant relies to justify that meaning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The <i>Lucas-Box</i> principle was accepted and applied by the Malaysian court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_2_86;"><i>Mirzan Mahathir v. Star Papyrus Sdn Bhd</i> [2000] 2 MLRH 86</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 29; [2000] 5 CLJ 507. Therefore it was submitted that the case-law authorities are clear that for a plea of justification, if the defendant contends the impugned words bear a different meaning from that ascribed by the plaintiff, it is for the defendant to state clearly and precisely the meaning that the defendant's contend, then provide particulars of facts that support that meaning.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It was submitted by learned counsel for the plaintiff that the proposed amendments to the defence by the defendant do not state the meaning prescribed to the impugned words at the start of the proposed amended plea. It was argued that in para 10 of the Proposed Amended Defence by the defendant, the defendant pleads that the impugned words in the plaintiff 's meaning are substantially true. But the defendant does not state an alternative meaning to justify his pleaded case that the impugned words carry a lesser or lower defamatory meaning. It was further argued that paras 8 and 9 of the Proposed Amended Defence are mere particulars and have not stated any alternative defamatory meanings in paras 10 and 11 of the same. Therefore it was submitted that the defendant had failed to comply with the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK> which provides that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It was submitted that the particulars pleaded in para 11(i) to (iv) of the Proposed Amended Defence are wholly unsatisfactory. The particulars are not statement of facts but merely an explanation by the defendant and his opinion of the opposition parties which are unsupported by facts. It was argued that the defendant in giving the particulars has not identified any wrongful act which the plaintiff is alleged to have committed and the facts which he relies on to show the truth of his alleged defamatory imputation. It was submitted that it is pertinent for the defendant to be precise and clear in giving his particulars so that the plaintiff is not taken by surprise at the trial and the issues for trial can be clearly defined and limited. Learned counsel for the plaintiff cited the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1989_4_686;"><i>Lee Kuan Yew v. Chin Vui Khen &amp; Anor</i> [1989] 4 MLRH 686</LINK>, where the court held that a defendant who pleaded justification must state some specific acts and instances of misconduct imputed to the plaintiff supported by precise particulars of fact as tending to show the truth of such misconduct. In that case the court struck out the relevant paragraphs of the defence because the particulars supplied by the defendant are too general as to embarrass the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in paras 12 and 13 of the Proposed Amended Defence, the defendant seeks to introduce an additional plea of partial justification. The proposed amendments in para 12 and of the Proposed Amended Defence reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> It was contended that a plea of partial justification is applicable only in a situation where the claimant complains of several defamatory allegations or charges contained in an impugned publication in which case a defendant could succeed if the defendant proves part of the libel is true. However in this case the plaintiff is complaining only of one defamatory allegation, ie "Anwar main dua-dua ikut belakang". The plaintiff is not making a complaint of a number of separate and different defamatory allegations or charges which conveys separate distinct imputations. It was submitted that the sting of the libel in the present case is that the plaintiff is a homosexual and is therefore unfit for public office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> Learned counsel for the plaintiff also submitted that the defendant's reliance on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> to bring in as a defence the observation by the Federal Court which may point to the involvement of the plaintiff in homosexual activities to support the defence of justification is contrary to law. It was argued that based on the authorities a conviction in a criminal proceedings is no evidence in civil proceedings. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1956_1_447;"><i>She Eng Gek v. DA De Silva</i> [1956] 1 MLRH 447</LINK>; [1957] 1 MLJ 55, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1975_1_96;"><i>Ong Tua Chor v.

Public Prosecutor</i> (Criminal Appeal No: W-05-19-01-2012) (unreported)]. Learned counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that the conviction of the plaintiff in 2014 is a subsequent event, some six years after the publication of the libel. Evidence of alleged bad reputation must be confined to the character of the plaintiff prior to or at the time of publication of libel, it was argued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> As to the issue of delay in making the application for amendment, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant took some three years after the original defence was filed to make the application. The original defence was filed on 8 October 2010. The application for the amendment, the subject matter of this appeal, was made some time in 2013. Though the defendant counsel had intimated to the learned High Court Judge an intention to amend the defence since December 2011, no steps were taken by the defendant to file the application then. This resulted in the court issuing on 13 August 2012 an order precluding the appellant from defending the action. This order was issued when the court was satisfied that the defendant had failed to comply with the court's direction given during case management and also an Unless Order issued by the court (probably with regards to the filing of the application to amend the statement of defence). Another reason given by plaintiff as to why the amendment hence this appeal should not be allowed is because no explanation was provided by the defendant in his affidavit to explain the delay and as to why no application to amend the defence was filed between December 2011 and August 2012. It was also pointed out that the defendant and his solicitors knew full well that the trial had been set down for 28 and 29 November 2013. It was submitted that if the application to amend were allowed at this late stage, the plaintiff will be greatly prejudiced.

      <b>Our Opinions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The issue in this appeal is whether the proposed amendments to the defence by the defendant have met the requirements stated in <i>Yamaha Motor (supra)</i> case in particular whether the amendment will be prejudicial to the plaintiff and whether the amendment to introduce the defence of partial justification has complied with the <i>Lucas Box</i> principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The purpose of the proposed amendments was made clear by learned counsel for the defendant in the preliminaries of his written submission when he said the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> In addressing this issue we are mindful of the principles governing amendments as laid down in <i>Yamaha Motor</i> case and, with regard to the amendment to introduce partial justification we have kept in the forefront of our mind the <i>Lucas Box</i> principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Whilst the defendant is not and cannot be restricted from seeking to justify the meanings or meanings attributed to the impugned words by the plaintiff, and that the defendant may give a <i>Lucas Box</i> meaning to the impugned words or meanings which are different from that alleged by the plaintiff as correctly held by the learned judge, the meanings which the defendant ascribed to the impugned words must be clear and precise. The defendant must also plead the particulars that will support the meanings that he ascribed to the impugned words. In this instant case, the plaintiff has alleged that the words uttered and published by the defendant bear the meaning that the plaintiff is a homosexual.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The learned judge had grabbed this issue by the horns when she said in her judgment as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Principles Governing The Defence Of Justification</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The <i>Lucas Box</i> principle was formulated by the English Court of Appeal in the well known case of <i>Lucas-Box v. News Group Newspaper Ltd</i> [1986] 1 All ER 177. It was held that in a defamation action, a defendant who does not agree with the meaning of the words about which the plaintiff makes of the impugned words, is entitled to give an alternative meaning and give particulars to justify that meaning. This is known as "the <i>Lucas-Box</i>" meaning. Ackner LJ explained (at p 181) that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The <i>Lucas Box</i> principle was followed in <i>Elaine Chase v. Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 1772 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_2_86;"><i>Mirzan Mahathir v. Star Papyrus Sdn Bhd</i> [2000] 2 MLRH 86</LINK>; [2000] 6 MLJ 29; [2000] 5 CLJ 507. The principle in these cases, make it abundantly clear that what is required for a plea of justification if the defendant contends the words bear a different meaning from that ascribed by the plaintiff, is to state with sufficient precision the meaning he contends and then provide particulars of facts that support that meaning. It is imperative that the meaning be pleaded with clarity so that a plaintiff knows what case he has to meet and the meaning which the defendant seeks to attribute to the words complained of.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As before the learned High Court Judge, the defendant here before us is also evasive and did not provide any clear answer when asked as to what meaning did the defendant attribute to the impugned statement with regard to the character or standing of the plaintiff. On the authorities cited by the counsel for the plaintiff which we have referred above it is crucial for the defendant to be clear and precise as to the meaning that he attributed to the impugned statement which is different from the meaning understood by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The defendant could have avoided the hassle of this appeal had the defendant ascribed the meaning to the impugned statement which is other than the meaning imputed to the plaintiff that the plaintiff is a homosexual and therefore unfit to hold public office. Such an act would have assisted the plaintiff to respond accordingly in their reply to the defence filed. However the defendant had refused to do so. Instead the defendant went on a frolic of his own by stating all the particulars in proposed amended defence, particulars of which are not exactly helpful to the plaintiff to understand the exact alternative meaning which the defendant had attributed to the impugned statement. In fact those particulars do not at all explain the meaning or meanings which the defendant claimed he had ascribed to the impugned statement which is different from the meaning understood by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> As such, in our view the defendant has not ascribed in clear and precise terms the alternative meaning of the impugned statement that he imputed to the plaintiff other than the meaning understood by the plaintiff. In our view, the particulars which the defendant provided in para 11(i) to (v) of the Proposed Amended Defence do not meet the requirements of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> In our respectful view, it is fatal for the defendant in not complying with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;78;SN3.;;">O 78 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>. The case of <i>Lee Kuan Yew v. Chin Vui Khen &amp; Anor (supra)</i> cited by the plaintiff is an authority to support this proposition. With regard to this point of the appeal we are in agreement with the learned High Court Judge that the particulars pleaded in para 11(i) to (v) of the Proposed Amended Defence are not statement of facts but a narrative of the defendant's view and opinions about the opposition parties of which the plaintiff is the de facto leader; the opposition parties are not parties to this appeal or the proceedings before the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Related to the issue raised by the defendant that the particulars pleaded are sufficient and provide the basis to justify a lesser meaning ascribed by the defendant to the impugned statement is the argument by the defendant that he could raise a plea of partial justification as evident in paras 12 and 13 of the Proposed Amended Defence. In this regard, it is pertinent to remember that the words or statements complained of by the plaintiff are that: "Anwar main dua-dua ikut belakang". In plain and ordinary meaning of the Malay language as understood by ordinary and reasonable Malaysian (whether he is a Malay or not) the words refer to only one act that is, in the context of which the words were said or uttered, the act of homosexuality. Therefore whilst <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;8.;;">s 8 of the Defamation Act 1957</LINK> which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>allows the defendant to avail himself to the defence of justification if one of the charges, if not all the charges, is proven to be true, the claim by the plaintiff in this case is only related to one charge that is the plaintiff is said to be homosexual or possesses the propensity to indulge in such act. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;8.;;">Section 8 of the Act</LINK> speaks of more than one charge in an impugned statement. This is clear from the language used in that section which reads '... a defence of justification shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved ...'. In the present appeal the complaint by the plaintiff is only in respect of one charge - homosexuality. The learned High Court Judge had referred to the English Court of Appeal case of <i>Polly Peck (Holdings) Plc &amp; Others v. Trelford &amp; Others</i> [1986] 2 All ER 84 where the court had to consider the scope and effect of s 5 of the English Defamation Act which is <i>in pari materia</i> with s 8 of our Act. There it was held that the section applied only where specific words of which the plaintiffs complained contained two or more distinct charges. In that case neither the plaintiffs nor defendants contended that the words of which the plaintiffs complained contained two or more distinct charges; therefore s 5 did not apply, and the fact that the impugned article (in that case) as whole contained more than one charge was irrelevant. The same argument in the appeal before us is applicable and valid. Here, as found by the learned judge the plaintiff is complaining only of one defamatory meaning of the statement which is sued upon. The statement does not allude to two or more different defamatory statements. We agree with this finding and therefore the defendant's argument that he can rely on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_286;8.;;">s 8 of the Act</LINK> to justify the amendment of partial justification is misconceived.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> Next, the defendant argued that he is entitled to raise the proposed defences in the proposed amended statement of claim and in particular to rely on the Federal Court judgment of 2004 [<LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_634;"><i>Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim v. PP &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 634</LINK>; [2009] 3 MLJ 737; [2004] 3 CLJ 737; [2004] 5 AMR 265] in which the plaintiff was, on appeal to the Federal Court, acquitted of a charge of sodomy; but the Federal Court made a finding of fact on the evidence that the appellant was involved in a homosexual activities. That finding is encapsulated in the passage in the judgment of the court at p 672 which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The plaintiff argued that reliance on the plaintiff's alleged homosexual conduct in the Federal Court's decision referred to above is impermissible and contrary to the clear terms of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">s 43 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK>. That section reads: "Judgments, orders, decrees other than those mentioned in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;40.;;">ss 40</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;41.;;">41</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;42.;;">42</LINK> are irrelevant unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in issue or is relevant under some other provision of this Act". In support of this argument the plaintiff relied on <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1963_1_324;"><i>Jusoh v. Ng Ah Sooi &amp; Anor</i> [1963] 1 MLRH 324</LINK>; [1963] 1 MLJ 92 and the Court of Appeal case (unreported) of <i>Dato Seri Anwar Bin Ibrahim v. Abdul Khalid @ Khalid Jafri bin Bakar Shah &amp; Anor</i> (W-02-741- 2000). The learned High Court Judge accepted the plaintiff's submission and rejected the defendant's contention. In our view the learned High Court Judge was correct. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;43.;;">Section 43 Evidence Act 1950</LINK> is crystal clear. Judgments which do not come within the ambit of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;40.;;">ss 40</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;41.;;">41</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;42.;;">42 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> are irrelevant unless the existence of the judgments is in issue. In this case the judgment of the Federal Court which the defendant is relying on for the above passage in the judgment is not in issue. The judgment is there but the plaintiff was never convicted under the said judgment. In this appeal the issue is not about the guilt or otherwise of the plaintiff's involvement in the alleged homosexual activities; but whether or not the impugned words or statement are defamatory of the plaintiff. Given that in the passage in the Federal Court judgment relied on by the defendant, the Federal Court had made finding of fact that there were evidence that the appellants there (one of whom was the plaintiff) was involved in homosexual activities, one must remember that there is no presumption that a prior judgment is the correct decision on the matter; and that there is nothing in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;;">Evidence Act 1950</LINK> to warrant the conclusion that the statements or finding of fact in another case can be used as evidence in a subsequent case to decide the points which are in issue in the subsequent case - see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2000_2_360;"><i>DP Vijandran v. Karpal Singh &amp; Ors</i> [2000] 2 MLRH 360</LINK>; [2000] 3 MLJ 22; [2000] 6 CLJ 433; [1993] 2 AMR 2266. Furthermore, the Federal Court case was not between the same parties as in this appeal, not to say the least that the passage by the Federal Court is highly prejudicial to the plaintiff who was acquitted by the Federal Court on the charge. It is immaterial whether the plaintiff was subsequently convicted of another charge of sodomy which charge and conviction was found well after the defendant had made the impugned statement; and which charge and conviction was not in any way related to the first charge on which the plaintiff was acquitted by the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> Finally, we will address the learned counsel for the defendant's argument that the correct judicial approach is not to dismiss the application to amend but to allow it giving the defendant a chance to make the proposed amendments on the condition that the particulars that were said to be lacking are pleaded in the amended defence that is ultimately filed in respect of the application. We appreciate the general rule with regard to amendment, that is, the court should lean towards allowing amendments to be made to the pleadings to make them clear and to put before the court all the material facts on the issue or issues that require the court's determination. However the court's discretion to do so must be exercised judiciously. The court must be satisfied that the proposed amendments have passed all the legal requirements and are not prejudicial to the party against whom the amendments are to be made. In other words the court must also consider the materiality and effectiveness of the amendments - see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1959_1_564;"><i>Ponnusamy &amp; Anor v. Nathu Ram</i> [1959] 1 MLRH 564</LINK>; [1959] MLJ 228 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2004_1_460;"><i>HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd v. Macquarie Technologies (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [2004] 1 MLRA 460</LINK>; [2004] 4 MLJ 398; [2004] 3 CLJ 121; [2004] 4 AMR 580 referred to by the learned High Court Judge in her written judgment. In the present appeal the proposed amendments by the defendant is to put in a defence of partial justification or to attribute a lesser meaning to the impugned words or statement which the plaintiff claimed to be defamatory of him. The defendant however was and is not forthcoming in stating clearly and precisely the lesser meaning which he ascribed to the impugned words attributed to the plaintiff. The particulars pleaded in the proposed amendments also do not give any indication of what is the lesser meaning that was attributed to the impugned words or statement that being sued upon by the plaintiff. Thus the plaintiff is prejudiced and would be left groping for the meaning or meanings which the defendant sought to give to the impugned words in order to put up a response to the Proposed Amended Defence when the words or statement complained of points only to one charge. It must not be forgotten that the defendant was given ample opportunity to amend the pleadings; but the defendant did nothing resulting in the court making an Unless Order to preclude the defendant from defending the case (which was later set aside on appeal). In this regard the argument that the amendments should be allowed on condition that the defendant pleads the particulars that were lacking in the proposed amendments when the defendant eventually filed the amended defence is not tenable in the circumstances of this case. The court has the discretion to consider the proposed amendments as they stand. After all that was what was proposed by the defendant for the court to consider after more than three years had lapsed since the defendant was given the opportunity to make the amendments. There is a clear lack of <i>bona fide</i> in the pursuit of this proposed amendments by the defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> For the above the reasons, this appeal by the appellant/defendant is dismissed with cost of RM5,000.00 to the respondent/plaintiff. The deposit is refunded to the appellant/defendant.</p>
