    <p>The appellants had made a claim that they were the descendants of the Royal Brunei family, in particular the descendants of one Dato' Pengiran Haji Matusin and had acquired native customary rights ("NCR") over several parcels of land in Kuala Lawas, Lawas, Sarawak. Accordingly, they claimed that they were entitled to compensation when the Government of Sarawak acquired the land for public purposes. The Government of Sarawak, vide the respondent, took the position that the appellants were not entitled to compensation as they had ceased to have NCR over the parcels of land when, by a Deed of 1905, Dato' Pengiran Haji Matusin had ceded his rights over the parcels of land to the Rajah of Sarawak in return for yearly payments. Accordingly, the parties entered into arbitration, where the arbitrator made an award in favour of the respondent and disallowed the appellants' claims for compensation. Consequently, the appellants made a reference to the High Court on 'questions of law' pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42(1) of the Arbitration Act 2005 ("the Act")</LINK>. The trial judge had, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42(4)(a) of the Act</LINK>, confirmed the award of the arbitrator, and dismissed the appellants' application. Hence, this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (dismissing the appeal with costs):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In the instant case, the 'questions of law' referred to the High Court were not genuine questions of law but rather an attempt to appeal against the decision of the arbitrator. The questions framed in the originating summons, were not concisely and clearly framed questions of law, but rather criticisms of the decisions of the arbitrator drafted in the manner that one would normally find in the 'grounds' of a memorandum (or petition) of appeal. In other words, the questions of law were an attempt to appeal against the award disguised as a 'reference on questions of law' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>. (para 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The 'questions of law' in the supporting affidavit were not the same as the 'questions of law' as formulated in the originating summons. Thus, there was an element of inconsistency and confusion here. The supporting affidavit should have adopted the same 'questions of law' as set out in the originating summons, and should have proceeded to explain the relevance and significance of each of the 'questions', and the supporting affidavit should have sought to explain why the questions must be answered in favour of the appellants. Further, the supporting affidavit should have set out the complete facts of the case, facts that were necessary or relevant for the purpose of the questions posed, and not suggestions on facts being disputed or of any disagreement on the part of the appellants with the evaluation of the evidence by the arbitrator. (paras 23-25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Obiter:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> A High Court in considering a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> reference must not take lightly the duty to critically examine the question posed by the applicant and to ensure that the question referred to the court was purely a question of law and not a question of mixed law and fact, and was clearly and concisely framed, before embarking to entertain the application and to answer the question posed. There should be no complication, confusion or duplicity in framing the questions. Instead, there should be simplicity and clarity. The legal burden was on the applicant to ensure that those requirements were strictly complied with. Accordingly, a court of law must always be vigilant against any attempt by a party to abuse the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> procedure in order to prevent the provision from being utilised as a backdoor avenue for appealing against the decision of an arbitral tribunal. Hence, the High Court must ensure that the question posed by the applicant to the court was a proper and valid question. (paras 27-29)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohd Hishamudin Yunus JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak at Limbang of 2 March 2014 (the decision delivered at the High Court at Miri).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We heard the appeal on 17 October 2014 and we informed parties that our decision will be delivered on 11 February 2015.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Today, we deliver our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> In its decision, the High Court had, pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42(4)(a) of the Arbitration Act 2005 ('the Act')</LINK>, confirmed the award of the arbitrator, and dismissed the appellants' application to set aside the same.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The confirmation of the award was made following a reference to the court by the appellants on 'questions of law' pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42(1) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> For the purpose of convenience, we reproduce the following relevant provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Backgrounds Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> As for the background facts, the appellants claim that they are the descendants of the Royal Brunei family, in particular, the descendants of one Dato' Pengiran Haji Matusin who had acquired native customary rights (NCR) over several parcels of land in Kuala Lawas, Lawas, Sarawak before the era of the Rajah Brooke. They claim that they are entitled to compensation when the Government of Sarawak 'acquired' the land for public purposes. The Government of Sarawak via the Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Limbang Division, took the position that the appellants are not entitled to compensation as they had ceased to have NCR over the parcels of land when, by the Deed of 1905, Dato' Pengiran Haji Matusin had ceded his rights over the parcels of the land to the Rajah of Sarawak in return for yearly payments of six thousand dollars per year perpetually.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> For the rest of the material facts, we find it convenient and adequate to just refer to the 'Brief Summary of Dispute Referred to Arbitration' prepared by the respondent in this appeal (Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Limbang Division), Sarawak and exhibited by the appellants in their affidavit in support (see exh AD-3) of their originating summons. This Brief Summary states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Award Of The Arbitrator</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The arbitrator made an award in favour of the respondent (Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Limbang Division) and disallowed the appellants' claims for compensations in respect of certain parcels of State land which the appellants are claiming as being the owner; holding that by the Deed of 1905 the appellants had ceded the parcels of land in question to the then Government of Sarawak, the Rajah of Sarawak; and with the cessation they ceased to have any proprietary rights over the land. The arbitrator rejected the contention of the appellants that by the Deed of 1905 they did not surrender their rights over the parcels of land; that they only surrendered their Tulin rights, that is, their rights to collect toll (taxes) over persons using the Lawas and Merapok river and their tributaries.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The award of the arbitrator is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The deed of 1905 referred to in the award of the arbitrator reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>There Is No Appeal Against The Decision Of An Arbitral Tribunal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> There is a basic and important legislative policy codified in our Arbitration Act, and that policy is that the award of an arbitrator is final and binding. There is no recourse to a court of law by way of an appeal. This is clearly stated by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;36.;;">s 36 of the Act</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Exceptions To The Policy</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> However, the Act provides for some but limited exceptions where an award of the arbitrator may be challenged in a court of law. A party to an arbitration proceedings aggrieved by an award may apply to a High Court to set aside the award under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;37.;;">s 37 of the Act</LINK>. But he may do so only in the limited circumstances as specified by that section.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Another exception is that a party to an arbitral proceedings, dissatisfied with the decision of the arbitral tribunal, may refer a question of law to the High Court pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> for the court's determination.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Reference To The High Court On 'Questions Of Law'</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> In the present case the appellants purported to refer to the High Court eight 'questions of law' pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>. The eight 'questions of law' are:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Decision Of The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The High Court, having heard the reference/application, refused to set aside the award, and, instead, confirmed the same. The learned High Court Judge, in his grounds of judgment, however, does not explain which of the eight 'questions of law' that he chose to answer (and why) and which of the same that he chose to discard (and why). However, he ruled:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> We have read and re-read the learned High Court Judge's grounds of judgment in its entirety and it is our disturbing impression in the present case that the learned High Court Judge, in spite of having noted that the application before him is a reference on questions of law pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> (see paras 1 and 7 of his grounds of judgment), and that there is no right of appeal to the High Court from the decision of the arbitrator (see para 13 of his grounds of judgment), yet from the tenor of his grounds of judgment he was treating the proceedings before him as if it is an 'appeal' against the decision of the arbitrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Approach Taken By Counsel Of Both Sides</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> We have also read the written submission of the learned counsel for the appellants as well as the written submission of the learned State Counsel for the respondent. It is our observation that, just like the learned High Court Judge, both counsel, in spite of having acknowledged that the proceedings before them is initiated pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>, yet appear to treat the proceedings as if it is an 'appeal' and not a reference on questions of law. There is scant regard for the purpose and integrity of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> that what is permissible under that provision is only to refer purely a question of law to the High Court, and nothing more.</p>
    <p>
      <b>High Courts Have No Appellate Jurisdiction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> On our part, in considering this appeal we remind ourselves what was said in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2007_1_251;"><i>Pembinaan LCL Sdn Bhd v. SK Styrofoam (M) Sdn Bhd</i> [2007] 1 MLRA 251</LINK>; [2007] 4 MLJ 113; [2007] 3 CLJ 185 by Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was), in delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal (at p 260, para [14]):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Decision Of This Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> We are dismissing the appeal with costs. Our decision is unanimous.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> However, our reason for dismissing the appeal is different from the reasons of the learned High Court Judge in refusing to set aside the award.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In our judgment the eight 'questions of law' referred to the High Court are not genuine questions of law but rather an attempt to appeal against the decision of the arbitrator. If it had been a genuine move to refer questions of law to the High Court, then, the questions of law would have been concisely and clearly framed; and the questions posed need not have to be as many as eight. Instead, what we find in the originating summons, are not concisely and clearly framed questions of law, but rather criticisms of the decisions of the learned arbitrator drafted in the manner that one normally finds in the 'grounds' of a memorandum (or petition) of appeal (note the repeated usage of the phrase 'erred in law' in every 'question' that was posed). In other words, we find the 'reference' to be an attempt to appeal against the award (which the Act does not allow) but disguised as a 'reference on questions of law' under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> And to add to the problem, we note with dismay that the 'questions of law' as spelt out in the supporting affidavit are not the same as the 'questions of law' as formulated in the originating summons. This is what the supporting affidavit states on the 'questions of law' to be determined:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> Thus there is an element of inconsistency and confusion here. The supporting affidavit should have adopted the same 'questions of law' as set out in the originating summons, and should have proceeded to explain the relevance and significance of each of the 'questions' (in the event the 'questions' are answered in favour of the appellants); and the supporting affidavit should seek to explain why the questions must be answered in favour of the applicants/ appellants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Further, the supporting affidavit should set out the complete facts of the case, facts that are necessary or relevant for the purpose of the questions posed. There should not be any suggestion in the affidavits of parties (but the affidavits, however, do suggest) of facts being disputed or of any disagreement on the part of the applicants/appellants with the evaluation of the evidence by the arbitrator.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Apart from the 'questions of law' posed in the supporting affidavit not being the same, we also observe that in the supporting affidavit, the 'questions of law' (which, now, numbers much less than eight), just like the 'questions of law' in the originating summons, are not concisely and clearly drafted; and, likewise, they are drafted in such a manner as if they are 'grounds' in a memorandum (or petition) of appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Guidance For High Courts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> We wish to take the opportunity here to provide the following guidance for the benefit of High Court Judges in dealing with a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> reference. A High Court in considering a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> reference must not take lightly the duty to critically examine the questions posed by the applicant and to ensure that the question referred to the court is purely a question of law and not a question of mixed law and fact, and is clearly and concisely framed, before embarking to entertain the application and to answer the question posed. There should be no complication, confusion or duplicity in framing the questions. Instead, there should be simplicity and clarity. The legal burden is on the applicant to ensure that these requirements are strictly complied with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> A High Court in dealing with a <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> reference must summarily dismiss the application, without even attempting to answer the 'question of law' posed to the court, if the question is, in the first place, not properly and intelligibly framed; or where it is clear to the court that there is a disguised attempt by the applicant to appeal against the decision of the arbitral tribunal. In other words, a court of law must always be vigilant against any attempt by a party to abuse the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_2005_646;42.;;">s 42</LINK> procedure as provided for by the Act and to utilise the provision as a backdoor avenue for appealing against the decision of an arbitral tribunal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Perhaps, to put what we have just said in another way, the High Court must ensure that the question posed by the applicant to the court is a proper and valid question. As the Court of Appeal said in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_2_377;"><i>SDA Architects v. Metro Millennium Sdn Bhd</i> [2014] 2 MLRA 377</LINK>; [2014] 2 MLJ 627; [2014] 3 CLJ 632 (at p 398, paras [45] to [48]):</p>
