      </p>
    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondents brought an action against the appellant for alleged infringement of their copyright to six engineering drawings of a rotational water meter known as the Kent PSM water meter. The 1st respondent claimed ownership by virtue of acquisition of the copyright whilst the 2nd respondent claimed an exclusive licence to the copyright in Malaysia and three other countries. The appellant pleaded that the infringing water meter was manufactured by one Lianyungang Lianli Water Meter Co of China and was of original design. The learned judge found, amongst others, that the Kent PSM water meter was of original design while the infringing water meter was substantially copied from the Kent PSM water meter and therefore not of original design. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, raising the issue that the statutory declaration ('SD') filed by the respondents pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42 of the Copyright Act 1987 ('the Act')</LINK> failed to adhere to the requirements of the section in that the drawings annexed to the SD were modified versions of the original drawings and therefore the originality of the drawings could not be judged by the court. The Court of Appeal held that the determination of whether the nature of the original drawings was apparent from the drawings annexed to the SD so as to enable the trial court to rule that the respondents had complied with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK> was a matter within the province of the trial court. Further, the appellant did not produce any factual evidence to challenge the respondents' claim to copyright and the respondents had shown a complete and unbroken chronology of their ownership to the copyright. Hence, the present appeal by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> There was no requirement for the original drawing to be annexed to the affidavit or SD of the respondents. The requirement was for a true copy of the work, ie a true and accurate depiction of the work in which copyright subsisted. Within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK>, the original was the work in which copyright subsisted, while a true copy thereof was a true and accurate representation of that original. The respondents produced true copies of the artistic works, namely the drawings in which copyright subsisted and not the original drawings. (para 12)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Where copyright was concerned, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;7.;;">ss 7</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;10.;;">10 of the Act</LINK> made no distinction between first and subsequent drawings. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;7.;;">Sections 7</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;10.;;">10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;26.;;">26(1)</LINK> read together provided that ownership of the copyright of a work eligible for copyright subsisted initially with the author. Unlike patents, trademarks and designs, copyright protection was accorded without any requirement of registration, deposit or otherwise. Under the Act, copyright arose automatically upon the creation of a work without the need for any form of registration. It followed therefore that copyright subsisted without formalities. (paras 13-14)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> Technical drawings were artistic works eligible for copyright. The instant drawings, albeit with modifications to the first or earliest drawings, were nonetheless artistic works. Their eligibility for copyright was a matter of fact and degree. Any revision of the first or earliest drawings could be the subject of copyright. Copyright therefore was not limited to the first or the earliest work. Each revision could be the subject of copyright so long as sufficient authorship skills and effort went into its creation. (paras 15, 17 &amp; 22)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The respondents gave a complete account, all authenticated by documents, of the chain of ownership of the copyright. The respondents showed that all modifications to the original design were brought about by the labour and effort of the employees of the 1st respondent or its predecessors from whom the 1st respondent acquired the copyright. The original design and modifications originated from the 1st respondent or its predecessors in title. The 1st respondent was the owner of the copyright of the original design and the entire chain of modifications. All should be taken as a whole and as being original. (para 27)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The respondents convincingly made out that copyright subsisted in the drawings and the 1st and 2nd respondents were respectively owner and licensee of the copyright. Further, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;26.;;">s 26(4)(a) of the Act</LINK> provided that subject to subsection (3) (not applicable in the present case), the name on a work purporting to be the name of its author was considered as such unless the contrary was proved. Pertinently, on each of the drawings the predecessor in title of the 1st respondent, namely Kent Meters Limited, appeared as the author. It was not shown that Kent Meters Limited was not the author or that the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK><i>prima facie</i> evidence was rebutted. It was also not shown that the finding of the courts below on infringement of copyright could not be supported. (para 28)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42(1) of the Act</LINK>, an affidavit or SD made by or on behalf of a person claiming the copyright to any works eligible for copyright must strictly comply with the whole of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42(1)(a)(i-iii)</LINK>. An affidavit or SD that did not do so would not be admissible as <i>prima facie</i> evidence. But <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK> was far from being the be-all and end-all proof. For other than by affidavit or SD, a person claiming copyright could adduce oral evidence and tender other evidence, the admission of which was not precluded by the Act. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">Section 42</LINK> provided a means but not the only means of proving copyright. The pragmatic approach adopted by some courts was to allow oral evidence to augment, correct, and/or supplant a defective <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK> affidavit or SD, given that oral evidence, which was open to cross-examination, was of higher evidential value than affidavit or SD evidence.

    <p>
      <b>Jeffrey Tan FCJ:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In this appeal against the concurrent findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeal, the sole question of law for determination by this court reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> As for the background facts, it would suffice to relate just the following. The 1st respondent, who claimed ownership by acquisition of the copyright, and the 2nd respondent, who claimed an exclusive licence to the copyright in Malaysia and three other countries, filed action against the appellant for alleged infringement of their copyright to six engineering drawings (see pp 158-163 of the Appeal Record) of a rotational water meter known as the Kent PSM water meter. The respondents alleged that the appellant caused to be manufactured, imported, and or offered for sale a water meter, known as PD97 TRP (infringing water meter), that was substantially modelled on the Kent PSM water meter. The respondents furthermore alleged that the infringing water meter was substantially the same as the Ningbo Water Meter, which in relation thereto, in Hong Kong Action 5768/2000, the 1st respondent had obtained judgment against a supplier of Ningbo water meters for infringement of the 1st respondent's copyright (though we must add that in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_6_219;"><i>Elster Metering Ltd &amp; Anor v. Damini Corporation Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2010] 6 MLRH 219</LINK>; [2011] 8 MLJ 253, it was held by Azahar Mohamed J, as he then was, that the Ningbo water meter was independently developed). The appellant pleaded that the infringing water meter, manufactured by one Lianyungang Lianli Water Meter Co of China, was of original design.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> It was the finding of the trial court that the Kent PSM water meter was of original design (see 468AR), while the infringing water meter, it being substantially copied from the Kent PSM water meter, was not (see 476AR and 480AR), that the appellant had not rebutted the <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the respondents had ownership of the said copyright (see 478AR), and that there was infringement of the copyright by the appellant (see 486AR).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At the Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the statutory declaration (SD) filed by the respondents pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42 of the Copyright Act 1987 (the Act)</LINK> "failed to adhere to the requirements of the section" in that the drawings annexed to the SD "lacked originality". By that, the appellant meant (that was so perceived by the Court of Appeal) that the drawings annexed to the SD were not original drawings but "modified versions" of the original drawings which could not provide the <i>prima facie</i> evidence of copyright, and that without the original drawings, the court could not judge the originality of the drawings (see paras 3, 6, and 15 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal), to which the respondents countered that each and every modification of the original drawings was annotated with a number and tabulated on the drawings, such that, with the log of modifications, the original design could be made out without the need to produce the entire set of original drawings and modifications thereto (see para 11 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal). The Court of Appeal held that "the determination of whether the nature of the original drawings was apparent from the drawings annexed to the statutory declaration so as to enable the trial court to rule that the respondents had complied with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK> is clearly a matter within the province of the trial court", that the appellant had not produced any factual evidence to challenge the respondents' claim to copyright, that the only real challenge of the appellant was on the validity of the assignment of the copyright to the 1st respondent, and that the defence of the appellant was unmeritorious as the respondents had shown a complete and unbroken chronology of their ownership to the copyright.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Before us, in his oral submission, learned counsel for the appellant rehearsed the argument that the 1st respondent had not complied with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42(1)(a)(ii) and (iii) of the Act</LINK> and contended that the 1st respondent had not asserted ownership. "The changes were shown but not on the original drawings" and "without the original drawings [one] could not see if there was copyright infringement", argued learned counsel for the appellant. In his written submission, the appellant appended the following arguments: (a) that where a statutory provision allows a departure from the rules of evidence, it must be strictly observed (in support, learned counsel cited <i>Tse Mui Chun v. HKSAR</i> [2003] HKCU 1408, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_3_57;"><i>Solid Gold Publishers Sdn Bhd v. Chan Wee Ho &amp; Ors</i> [1998] 3 MLRH 57</LINK>; [1998] 5 CLJ 735; [1998] 4 AMR 3949, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_3_305;"><i>Elster Metering Ltd &amp; Anor v. Premier Amalgamated Sdn Bhd</i> [2009] 3 MLRH 305</LINK>; [2010] 2 CLJ 149, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2009_2_783;"><i>Ultra Dimension Sdn Bhd v. American Home Assurance Company; Rewardstreet.com (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (Third Party)</i> [2009] 2 MLRH 783</LINK>; [2009] 8 MLJ 643; [2009] 9 CLJ 589, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2010_1_503;"><i>Ultra Dimension Sdn Bhd v.

Sim, Odita, Muhammad Architects Sdn Bhd</i> [2007] 3 MLRH 500</LINK>; [2008] 7 MLJ 164; [2008] 3 CLJ 623, where the court articulated on strict compliance of the provision), (ii) that "true copies of the original artistic works made by Elster Metering Limited or its predecessor ... " as exhibited by the respondent were not copies of the original artistic works, and, (iii) that the subsequent drawings, even if they were substantially the same as the original drawings, lacked originality to enjoy copyright protection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> Learned counsel for the respondents orally responded that the modifications were made on both original and new drawings, that new drawings yet enjoyed copyright protection, that ownership of copyright was asserted by the respondents, that infringement of a part of the drawings was yet copyright infringement, and that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> had not been rebutted. In his written submission, learned counsel for the respondents submitted, <i>inter alia</i>, (i) that the pivotal issue was whether the drawings were eligible for copyright protection, (ii) that the said drawings were eligible for copyright protection, (iii) that the modifications, which the courts below found as insubstantial, did not erase the original character of the drawings, (iv) that the respondents had strictly complied with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>, (v) that bare denials could not rebut the <i>prima facie</i> facts, (vi) that the true copy required by the Act is a true copy of the work eligible for copyright protection, and, (vii) that the drawings were true copies of the work eligible for copyright protection.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> This is the appropriate juncture to reproduce <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK>, which provides:</p>

      <b>[11]</b> Professor Khaw Lake Tee ended her commentary on <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK> with a reference to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_5_298;"><i>Rock Records &amp; Tapes Co Ltd &amp; 5 Ors v.

Chan Tak Tim</i> [2004] 4 HKC 98, and <i>HKSAR v. Elegant Technology Ltd</i> [2004] 3 HKC 37, which cases seemed to the learned professor to suggest that failure to annex a true copy of the work might not necessarily be fatal (see <i>Copyright Law in Malaysia</i> at p 69) and that evidence by the copyright owner at the trial might overcome defects in the affidavit (<i>Copyright Law in Malaysia</i> at p 71). In <i>Rock Records &amp; Tapes Co Ltd &amp; 5 Ors v. Season Karaoke Sdn Bhd &amp; 4 Ors</i>, the plaintiff failed to annex copies of the sound recordings. The court held that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> did not prohibit the use of an affidavit where the work was not annexed nor did it prescribe the one and only method of proving copyright. In <i>Rock Records (M) Sdn Bhd v. Audio One Entertainment Sdn Bhd</i>, the affidavit merely listed the particulars of the sound recordings alleged to have been infringed. Abdul Malik Ishak J, as he then was, nonetheless accepted the affidavit upon production of the original albums and recordings. In <i>Tse Mui Chun v. HKSAR</i>, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal held that an affidavit filed pursuant to s 121 of the Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528) (which is almost identical to our <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK>) "is not admissible in evidence unless it states the matters required to be stated by paras (a) to (c) of subsection (1)". <i>Tse Mui Chun v. HKSAR</i> espoused strict compliance. Yet, in <i>HKSAR v. Chan Tak Tim</i>, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal accepted the tender of copies of a video game computer software as true copies of a computer program and rejected the argument that the affidavit on the subsistence and ownership of copyright should not be admitted for failure to comply with s 121(1)(b). And in<i>HKSAR v. Elegant Technology Ltd</i>, where the affidavit failed to comply with some of the statutory requirements but evidence of ownership was provided at the trial by the copyright owner and ownership of the works was not disputed by the defendant, the Court of Appeal held at p 49, with respect to the argument that the affidavit was defective, that as ownership of the work was not in dispute, the defective affidavit was a technical defect without any relevance to the issue at trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> Clearly, therefore, there was no requirement for the original drawing, original in the sense of not copied or in the sense of the first or the earliest, to be annexed to the affidavit or SD of the respondents. The requirement was for a true copy of the work, in the sense of a true and accurate depiction of the work in which copyright subsisted. In the context and within the meaning of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK>, the original is the work in which copyright subsisted, while a true copy thereof is a true and accurate representation of that original. The respondents produced what were said to be true copies of the artistic works, namely the drawings in which copyright subsisted. The original drawings were not produced. But as said, there was no requirement for the production of original drawings. On that, we expressly disagree with the Court of Appeal who held "<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK> in its present form allows a copyright owner to produce the original and where such drawings are not available, other drawings to prove copyright ownership" (see para 16 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal) and so obliquely suggested that the original is the document to be annexed. Rather, the production of true copies thereof had fulfilled the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42(1)(a)(iii) of the Act</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Still, that which were produced were not true copies of the first or earliest drawings. That which were produced were true copies of the final drawing, or the final product after successive modifications of the first or the earliest drawings. But in so far as copyright is concerned, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;7.;;">ss 7</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;10.;;">10 of the Act</LINK> make no distinction between first and subsequent drawings. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;7.;;">Section 7</LINK> provides that artistic works "shall be eligible for copyright". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;10.;;">Section 10 of the Act</LINK> provides that "copyright shall subsist in every work eligible for copyright of which the author or in the case of a work of joint authorship, any of the authors is, at the time when the work is made, a qualified person". <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;26.;;">Section 26(1) of the Act</LINK> further provides that "copyright conferred by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;10.;;">s 10</LINK> shall vest initially in the author". And <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;26.;;">s 26(4)</LINK> provides that "subject to subsection (3) the name on a work purporting to be the name of its author shall be considered as such, unless the contrary is proved".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> When read together, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;7.;;">ss 7</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;10.;;">10</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;26.;;">26(1)</LINK> provide that ownership of the copyright of a work eligible for copyright shall subsists initially with the author. "Unlike patents, trademarks and designs, copyright protection is accorded without any requirement of registration, deposit or otherwise" (<i>Copyright Law in Malaysia</i> at p 21). "Under the Act, copyright arises automatically upon the creation of a work without the need for any form of registration" (<i>Intellectual Property Law in Malaysia</i> by Tay Pek San at p 270). In short, copyright subsists without formalities.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It is settled that technical drawings are artistic works eligible for copyright (see <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1969_1_508;"><i>Lau Foo Sun v. Government Of Malaysia</i> [1969] 1 MLRA 508</LINK>; [1970] 1 MLJ 20, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_521;"><i>TR Hamzah &amp; Yeang Sdn Bhd v. Lazar Sdn Bhd</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 521</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 45; [1985] CLJ 312 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_1_16;"><i>Peko Wallsend Operations Ltd &amp; 3 Ors v. Linatex Process Rubber Bhd</i> [1993] 1 MLRH 16</LINK>; [1993] 1 MLJ 225; [1993] 1 AMR 675). Hence, the instant drawings, albeit with modifications of the first or earliest drawings, were nonetheless artistic works. Now whether they were eligible for copyright is a matter of fact and degree. Indeed, each and every revision of the first or earliest drawings could be the subject of copyright. That was so expounded by the learned authors of <i>The Modern Law of Copyrights and Designs</i> (3rd edn) by Laddie, Prescott and Vitoria in their commentary on the law relating to works derived from earlier material, at paras 3.64 and 3.65:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Paragraphs 2.15-2.17 of <i>The Law of Copyright in Singapore</i> (2nd edn) by George Wei imparted the following in relation to the copyright of derivative works:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Copyright is therefore not limited to the first or the earliest work. The following cases, amongst others, illustrate the application of that principle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> In <i>LA Gear Inc v. Hi-Tech Sports plc</i> [1991] Times, 20 December, it was held by the English Court of Appeal that revisions of drawings are protected by copyright. Nourse LJ said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In <i>ABB Ltd v. New Zealand Insulators Ltd</i> [2006] 3 NZCCLR 645, Courtney J agreed with Smellie J in <i>Husqvarna Forest &amp; Garden Ltd v. Bridon New Zealand Ltd</i> [1997] 3 NZLR 215 that extensive changes made in subsequent drawings could be sufficient to regard the later drawings as original:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In <i>Fossil Inc v. Trimset Ltd &amp; Anor</i> [2003] HKCU 521, Deputy High Court Judge Carson held that the evidence amply demonstrated that copyright subsisted in the sketch and in the subsequent drawings identified in the statement of claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> And in <i>Cala Homes (South) Ltd and others v. Alfred McAlpine Homes East Ltd</i> [1995] IP &amp; T Digest 18, where it was contended by the defendant that (i) there was no originality in the drawings for C's new range as they were an adaptation of earlier drawings, (ii) the onus lay on the C to specifically identify which drawings had been infringed taking into consideration that the first drawings had been subject to repeated modification, and (iii) the copyright in CH's drawings did not belong to C, Laddie J held, according to the report of the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Each revision would be the matter of copyright, "so long as sufficient authorship skills and effort have gone into its creation" (<i>Copyright Law in Malaysia</i> at p 34). On the originality and authorship of the instant drawings, we see it apt that we should first refer to <i>Lau Foo Sun</i> (<i>supra</i>), where on the question of "whether or not the engineering drawings and designs are original works within the meaning of the Copyright Enactment, FMS Laws (Cap 73)" (replaced by the Act), Ali FCJ, with the concurrence of the entire court, said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;7.;;">Section 7(3)(a) of the Act</LINK> provides that "a literary, musical or artistic work shall not be eligible for copyright unless sufficient effort has been expended to make the work original in character". But originality in this context means the same as before 1987, that is, that while the artistic work must be original, yet originality in the context of copyright does not mean that the work must be in an original or novel form. To be original, the work must originate from the author (see the celebrated case of <i>University of London Press Ltd v. University Tutorial Press</i> [1916] 2 Ch 601, where Pearson J said: "The originality which is required relates to the expression of the thought. But the (Copyright) Act does not require that the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied from another work - that it should originate from the author", which enunciation was followed by a host of cases, including in the local jurisdiction, <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_1_116;"><i>Kiwi Brands (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v. Multiview Enterprises Sdn Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRH 116</LINK>; [1998] 6 MLJ 38; [1998] 3 AMR 2791 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2001_2_278;"><i>Lam Soon (M) Bhd v. Forward Supreme Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2001] 2 MLRH 278</LINK>; [2001] 6 MLJ 651; [2001] 4 CLJ 673, amongst many others). "The copyright laws do not require that a work should be unprecedented, that is, new in comparison with already existing works. This stands in contrast with some other branches of the law of intellectual property. A patent is bad if the invention was not new, or was obvious, having regard to what was already known or used when protection was applied for. The same is true of a registered design. A copyright, however, is good provided a sufficient amount of the work was originated by the author independently, even if some other person had already produced an identical piece by sheer coincidence" (<i>The Modern Law of Copyrights and Designs</i> at para 3.64).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In <i>Copinger and Skone James on Copyright</i> (16th edn), which is arguably, one of, if not the most authoritative text in common law jurisdictions on copyright, the learned authors at para 3-136 imparted the following on derivative works and originality, and the attendant copyright:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The same said para 3-136 presciently continued, as if to address the instant facts and arguments, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> But the whole chain of works was clearly stated as being owned by the 1st respondent. In para 4 the SD, it was affirmed that the said drawings were true copies of original drawings made by employees of the 1st respondent or its predecessor in the course of their employment. In para 6 of the SD, it was affirmed that on 3 April 1966, Kent Meters Ltd acquired the mechanical meters business and all intellectual property of George Kent Limited. In para 7 of the SD, the Respondents labouriously explained that George Kent Limited changed its name to Brown Boveri Kent Limited on 1 January 1980 which then became Brown Boveri Limited Plc on 13 August 1982, that Brown Boveri Limited Plc changed its name to ABB Kent Plc on 6 June 1988, that ABB Kent Plc changed its name and re-registered as ABB Metering Holdings Limited on 11 January 1999, and that ABB Metering Holdings Limited changed its name to Elster Metering Limited on 5 December 2002. The 1st respondent was at one time known as George Kent Limited, the original copyright owner. In relation to the instant drawings, in para 8 of the SD, it was affirmed that the 1st respondent acquired the said copyright by an assignment dated 1 June 2000 between ABB Metering Holdings Limited and ABB Metering Limited. And in para 9 of the SD, it was affirmed that the 2nd respondent had the exclusive licence to the same, pursuant to a manufacturing and distribution agreement dated 1 August 1995 between the respondents.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Clearly therefore, it could not be argued that the respondents had not asserted ownership of copyright. Indeed, the respondents had given a complete account, all authenticated by documents, of the chain of ownership of the copyright from the beginning to the lap of the 1st respondent. More than that, the respondents had shown (see 157AR) that all modifications of the original design were brought about by the labour and effort (the dates of execution of the works were disclosed) of the employees (all named) of the 1st respondent or its predecessors from whom the 1st respondent acquired the copyright. The original design and its modifications, as per the drawings, all originated from the 1st respondent or its predecessors in title. The 1st respondent was the owner of the copyright of the original design and entire chain of modifications. As such, as imparted by <i>Copinger and Skone James on Copyright</i> (16th edn) at para 3-136, the appellant should be given "short shrift from the court" in their attempt to argue that the earliest works had not been disclosed and that the later ones must be unoriginal being copies of the earlier drawings with only insignificant alterations. Again as imparted by <i>Copinger and Skone James on Copyright</i> (16th edn) at para 3-136, the latter argument might be important where "the earlier works are no longer entitled to copyright or because the claimant does not own the copyright in the whole chain of works". But as the 1st respondent owned "the entire chain of works", the original drawings and all modifications should be taken as a whole and as being original.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> It was so convincingly made out that copyright subsisted in the said drawings and that the 1st and 2nd respondents were respectively owner and licensee of the copyright. On top of that, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;26.;;">s 26(4)(a) of the Act</LINK> provides that "subject to subsection (3) [which is not applicable to the instant case], the name on a work purporting to be the name of its author shall be considered as such, unless the contrary is proved". Pertinently, on each of the said drawings (see 228A-228E of the Appeal Record), the predecessor in title of the 1st respondent, namely Kent Meters Limited, appeared as the author. It was not shown to us that Kent Meters Limited was not the author or that the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK><i>prima facie</i> evidence had been rebutted. It was also not shown to us that the finding of the courts below on infringement of copyright could not be supported. With respect, we see no arguable merit in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Nevertheless, we could answer the leave question as follows. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42(1) of the Act</LINK>, an affidavit or SD made by or on behalf of a person claiming the copyright to any works eligible for copyright must strictly comply with the whole of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42(1)(a)(i-iii)</LINK>. An affidavit or SD that does not, will not be admissible as <i>prima facie</i> evidence. But <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42 of the Act</LINK> is far from being the be-all and end all of proof. For other than by affidavit or SD, a person claiming copyright could adduce oral evidence and tender other evidence, the admission of which is not precluded by the Act. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">Section 42</LINK> provides a means but not the only means of proving copyright. And given that oral evidence, which is open to cross-examination and therefore of higher evidential value than affidavit or SD evidence, we agree with the pragmatic approach adopted by some courts to allow oral evidence to augment, correct, and or even supplant a defective <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1987_332;42.;;">s 42</LINK> affidavit or SD.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> For the reasons aforesaid, we unanimously dismiss this appeal with costs.</p>
