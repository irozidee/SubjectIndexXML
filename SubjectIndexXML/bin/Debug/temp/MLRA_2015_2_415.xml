    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The appellants' claim was struck out in the High Court due to the respondents' application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19 Rules of Court 2012 ('ROC')</LINK>. The claim was struck out on the grounds of <i>estoppel</i> and <i>res judicata</i>. The High Court was of the view that the instant claim was based on essentially the same issues as a 2004 claim ("the 2004 claim"). The 2004 claim was dismissed by the High Court and an appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed. Although the Federal Court had granted leave to appeal, it subsequently dismissed the substantive appeal in the 2004 claim. In the instant appeal, the appellants submitted <i>inter alia</i>, that the issues between the 2004 claim and the instant action were different.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal with costs:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> To strike out a claim under O 18 r 19(1) ROC the case must be on its face conspicuously unsustainable and the power to do so must be exercise sparingly. The procedure is ill-suited for cases where the finding of unsustainability can only be reached upon a protracted hearing resembling a preliminary hearing by affidavit evidence on the merits of the case. The rationale for this is that a litigant should not be shut out from the judgment seat so summarily unless he obviously has no defensible case. (paras 33-34)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b>
      <i>Res judicata</i> or <i>estoppel</i> per rem judicatam is identified with cause of action <i>estoppel</i> and operates where there is an identity of parties. Cause of action <i>estoppel</i> prevents the reassertion of the cause of action whilst issue <i>estoppel</i> prevents the contradiction of a previous determination. Cause of action <i>estoppel</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> are two separate components of <i>estoppel</i> per rem judicatam. (paras 38-39)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the cause of action was based on breach of trust, invalidity of the sale and purchase agreement and equitable fraud. The earlier action was premised on whether the appellants ("the settlors") had acquired a priority of interest. The question was whether there existed a sufficient degree of identification between the plaintiffs in the earlier originating summons action and the present plaintiffs in the writ action to make it just and reasonable that the present plaintiffs should be bound by the outcome of the originating summons action. (paras 40 &amp; 45)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> At the present stage of the proceedings - limited to a consideration of whether the case was obviously unsustainable - this court was unable to conclude that it was plain and clear that the same issues were canvassed before the earlier courts or formed the basis of the earlier decision. When the High Court concluded that the issue of constructive trust was decided in the earlier action and was therefore <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> applied, there was a clear misdirection on the facts and the law by the court which invited appellate intervention. (para 50)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant appeal and in the totality of the circumstances, the facts and the applicable law, the claim of the appellants was not <i>prima facie</i> obviously unsustainable that it had to be summarily struck out under O 18 r 19(1) ROC. (para 51)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>A. Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> In these interlocutory appeals from the decision of the High Court which struck out the plaintiffs' writ and statement of claim under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court 2012</LINK>, there are altogether 140 appellants (the plaintiffs below) with two sets of respondents, namely the 1st respondents comprising the liquidators of the company called The Great Alonioners Trading Corporation Bhd ("Gatco") and the 2nd respondent which is a company named Thamarai Holdings Sdn Bhd ("Thamarai"). One appeal is brought against the striking out application filed by the 1st respondents (encl 7), while the second appeal concerns the striking out application filed by the 2nd respondent (encl 10). Both were allowed by the High Court. After hearing full submissions by counsel and appreciating the special circumstances of this case, and the issues of law which have been extensively submitted bearing on the exact perimeters of the doctrines of <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> (and their relationship), as well as the ramifications of the legal concepts of "privies" or "privies in interest", on the premise that <i>res judicata</i> binds not only the immediate litigants but also their "privies", we reserved our decision to a later date. We now provide our full decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>B. The Parties</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> It bears emphasis that the appellants here number 140 persons. The 140 appellants were the plaintiffs in the writ action. They sue in their individual capacities. The 1st respondents are the liquidators of Gatco. The 2nd respondent ("Thamarai") is the purchaser who purchased the parcels of leased land, the underlying subject matter of the action, from the liquidators.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We now turn to a narration of the underlying material facts to analyse the subject matter of the dispute, the position of the respective parties in relation thereto and the decisions of the several courts bearing on the issue of <i>res judicata</i>, issue <i>estoppel</i>, privies and privies in interest, against a consideration of whether this appeal is a proper case for summary disposal under a striking out proceeding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>C. Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The subject matter of the dispute concerns several parcels of land (Lots 774, 775 and 776, HS(D) Leases 21, 22, 23) which are held under leases originally granted in 1977 by the State Economic Development Corporation of Negeri Sembilan ("SEDC") to Gatco to be converted into a land development scheme by the National Union of Plantation Workers ("NUPW") for its members, originally to be planted with sugar cane but later converted to the planting of rubber. Gatco itself was incorporated by NUPW for this purpose. The leases for 66 years registered in Gatco's name on 27 November 1977 totalled approximately 4,700 acres ("the land"). As pleaded in the statement of claim, NUPW had invited its members to participate in the scheme. The present plaintiffs/appellants took up the offer and each paid a sum of RM7,600.00 as deposit. They settled on the plots allotted to them and worked upon the land. It is pleaded that they "have been in undisturbed possession of the land since 1977."</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Indorsement On The Lease</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The leases were registered in Gatco's name, with an indorsement reading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> This indorsement, it is argued by the appellants, results in a constructive trustee relationship between Gatco and the settlers. Failure of the land settlement scheme and the charging of the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The settlement scheme failed. Gatco had obtained additional financing from two financial institutions (United Asian Bank ("UAB") and Nederlandse Financiering Maatschappi Voor Ontwik Kelingslanden ("FMO")), and these parcels were then charged to these two financial institutions as secured creditors. It appears from the evidence that these lands were charged only sometime in 1978 and 1984, meaning to say, after the plaintiffs had paid their deposit mentioned earlier above. See the background facts as analysed by the Court of Appeal in an earlier decision dated 17 February 2010 (Rayuan Sivil No: N-02-566-2008).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> It is the respondents' position that this earlier decision of the Court of Appeal (and that of the Federal Court on appeal) bind the present appeal as a matter of <i>res judicata</i>. The appellants maintain otherwise. This earlier decision will be analysed in detail shortly in this judgment. We now quote an excerpt of relevance to elucidate the background facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> This narration of the material facts by the earlier Court of Appeal decision, however, fails to advert to another fact which is now averred to by the plaintiffs in the statement of claim, para 149, reading:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> This additional fact is not mentioned expressly in the narration of facts by the Court of Appeal in the earlier decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The present appellants have put the issue in general terms. Some of the underlying facts, according to the appellants, are contentious and will require full ventilation in a full trial by writ. This case is therefore unsuited to be summarily disposed by a striking out application under O18 r 19.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On the undisputed facts, there was a default on the loans by Gatco whereupon the secured creditors appointed receiver and manager over the charged assets on 28 August 1992.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> Four years later, a third party (M Karupanan Trading) presented a winding-up petition against Gatco for an indebtedness of RM135,000.00. Gatco was wound up on 21 November 1996 and the present liquidators were appointed on 21 July 1996.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> It appears that even after the appointment of the receiver and manager over the charged assets no attempt was made to institute any auction proceedings in relation to the charged lands. There was a tender exercise attempted but it failed. Thereafter, on 26 May 2004, nearly eight years after the liquidators were appointed, the liquidators invited interested parties to make a bid for the land. At this juncture, some 214 settlers made an offer to purchase the lands at RM16 million. This offer was rejected, apparently because the settlers could not show proof of means to pay the balance purchase price. The 2% of the purchase price (RM320,000.00) of RM16 million was however paid by them. The liquidators had also stated than that they were not obliged to accept any bid and reserved the right to vary the terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Originating Summons Action In The High Court, Seremban</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was at this juncture that the 214 settlers filed an action by way of originating summons in the High Court at Seremban (Saman Pemula No: 24-1360-2004). This was commenced by a representative action in the name of their representative, Mariayee a/p Palaniappan, "bertindak sebagai wakil kepada peneroka-peneroka Kampung GATCO". The 214 settlers were sued through Mariayee included some names (59 in all) who comprised some of the present appellants in this immediate appeal. These appellants have denied authorising Mariayee to commence the earlier action in their names. They have expressly denied granting the power of attorney to Mariayee to act on their behalf.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The respondent in this originating summons action was the Great Alonioners Trading Corporation Bhd, the present respondent (Gatco) in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The settlers who instituted the originating summons action submitted that as a matter of contract they had acquired a legal interest in the land through the initial payment of the deposit at the start of the scheme and had each contributed RM5,593.52 for the further deposit sum for the land, and therefore, relying principally on the cases of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1971_1_747;"><i>Linggi Plantations Ltd v. Jagatheesan</i> [1971] 1 MLRA 747</LINK>; [1972] 1 MLJ 89 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1995_1_124;"><i>Morello Sdn Bhd v. Jaques (International) Sdn Bhd</i> [1995] 1 MLRA 124</LINK>; [1995] 1 MLJ 577; [1995] 2 CLJ 23; [1995] 1 AMR 873, claimed that they had acquired a proprietary interest in the land. See the reference to this submission in the written judgment of the Court of Appeal which heard the appeal from the High Court, Seremban (at p 6 of the judgment, included in Tab H of the 1st respondent's Bundle of Authorities).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Consent Judgment Of 8 November 2004</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> It appeared that a consent judgment was entered between the 214 settlers and Gatco on 8 November 2004 whereby the parties agreed not to sell or deal with the land until the matter was disposed of by the High Court, Seremban. Nevertheless, the record disclosed that Gatco entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Thamarai on 2 December 2006 to sell the land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The liquidators of Gatco had argued that it was not obliged to sell the land to the settlers for failure to show proof of their financial competency to complete the sale. The settlers had submitted a proposal to pay the balance of the purchase price through the proceeds from the felling of the rubber trees on the land, which was not found acceptable to the liquidators.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Broad Grounds Of The Court Of Appeal In The Originating Summons Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The High Court, Seremban dismissed the originating summons, and the matter was appealed to the Court of Appeal, which also dismissed the appeal by the settlers. Given the importance of the arguments on <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> in this present appeal before us, we reproduce below in full that part of the appeal in the previous Court of Appeal judgment bearing on these issues. We quote pp 15 to 16 of the judgment below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> The Court of Appeal also concluded that "based on the nature and character of the prayers in the originating summons" any order granted in the settlers' favour "will render the said orders to be made in vain." At this juncture, it is noteworthy to stress that one of the "broad grounds" stated included the ground that insufficient particulars of the other affected settlers being given in the proceedings would "inevitably" affect their rights and interests too.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Dismissal Of The Further Appeal By The Federal Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The Federal Court granted leave to appeal to the settlers but the Federal Court subsequently dismissed the substantive appeal. No written ground for the dismissal was supplied by the Federal Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>D. The Claims In The Present Writ Action</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Unlike the originating summons action, which was between the 214 settlers suing through their attorney (Mariayee) against the liquidators of Gatco, the present writ action, as said earlier in this judgment, is instituted by the 140 appellants in their personal capacity against not only the liquidators of Gatco but also against the purchaser of the land, Thamarai. The sale and purchase had been perfected after the dismissal of the appeal in the earlier action by the Federal Court. Thamarai is presently registered as the landowner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> As can be appreciated from the previous analysis of the originating summons action, the emphasis there was on whether the applicants had a priority of interest in the land since they had a proprietary interest over the land. In the present writ action, however, the challenge mounted is over the validity of the sale of the land to Thamarai by the liquidators. See paras 156 to 160 of the statement of claim. Paragraph 156, for instance, avers:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The "trust" referred to is the alleged "constructive trust" said to arise from the indorsement on the lease which has been adverted to earlier in this judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Reliefs In The Writ Action</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The present appellants claim the following reliefs:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The defendants in this writ action filed two separate applications (encls 7 and 10), under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19(1)(b), (c) and (d)</LINK>, to strike out the writ and statement of claim. Both applications raised the issues of <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i>, but the 2nd defendant (Thamarai) raised an additional issue pertaining to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2) of the National Land Code</LINK>, ie that Thamarai now possesses an indefeasible title to the land. It is argued the plaintiffs/appellants have not pleaded that the title is defeasible.</p>
    <p>
      <b>E. The Decision Of The High Court In This Writ Action</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner in the High Court below agreed with the defendants' contentions and thus struck out the writ and statement of claim. The claim was struck out as it was "barred by the doctrine of <i>estoppel</i> and <i>res judicata</i>." (See p 34 of the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner.) In his finding, the Judicial Commissioner held that the claim in 2004 was based on essentially the same issues. It was then also submitted that the sale and purchase agreement with Thamarai was null and void, and that there was a constructive trust binding Gatco and Thamarai. See the following material excerpts from the judgment which appears at pp 11-20 (the paragraph numbers are retained):</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>F. The Appellants' Submissions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> The appellants impressed upon us that the scheme was one involving workers who belonged to the NUPW, and when the land was leased to the Union by SEDC, it was an express condition, as seen in the indorsement, that although Gatco could charge the land, the interests of the participants in the scheme should not be prejudiced. There was therefore a constructive trust in the settlers' favour. The liquidators of Gatco had purported to sell the land to Thamarai although there was an interim order not to sell, and Thamarai had notice of the constructive trust. Counsel for the appellants stressed that they are relying on equitable fraud. On the <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> point, counsel argues the issues between the 2004 suit and the present one are different, and in this light the learned Judicial Commissioner had misdirected himself when holding otherwise. The learned Judicial Commissioner should have looked only at the broad grounds of the Court of Appeal (the Federal Court not having provided written grounds) and it would be evident that the issue of constructive trust was not part of the broad grounds. In particular, what appears as para [21] in the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner is said to be a clear misdirection. To place the submission in context, para [21] is quoted below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> The appellants' reference to "equitable fraud" as one basis of their claim is premised, <i>inter alia</i>, on the definition as stated in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1985_1_150;"><i>Rasiah Munusamy v. Lim Tan &amp; Sons Sdn Bhd</i> [1985] 1 MLRA 150</LINK>; [1985] 2 MLJ 291; [1985] CLJ 266, in that it is "not a fraud in the common law sense, but an unmeritorious and unconscionable conduct which is known as constructive or equitable fraud." The sale of the land to Thamarai at an undervalue, and in disregard of the constructive trust, would be evidence of such equitable fraud, it is argued.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> It is also strenuously advanced in argument that the present appellants are different from the settlers in the 2004 suit. Of the 49 settlers who were supposed to be represented by Mariayee in the 2004 suit, they have stated categorically they did not authorise Mariayee to be their attorney and their signatures had been forged in the process.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> We have also been reminded on the governing principles on striking out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19</LINK>. The case must be "obviously unsustainable". The court at this stage should not be concerned, and deciding on, the substantive merits of the case, but should address its mind on whether there are issues that should be further ventilated at trial. On the facts of this case and this appeal, there are, it is argued, major contentious issues of fact and law that cannot be decided summarily under a striking out procedure. Thus, we are urged to allow these two appeals and remit the case back for trial.</p>

      <b>G. The Relevant Law On <i>Res Judicata</i> And Issue <i>Estoppel</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The rules of striking out under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayformat.asp?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order18;SN19.;;">O 18 r 19(1)</LINK> require the applicant to establish that the case of the opposing party is <i>prima facie</i> obviously unsustainable. The Malaysian "White Book", namely "Malaysian Civil Procedure 2013", has usefully summarised the governing rules thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> In short, the case must on its face be conspicuously unsustainable and the power has to be exercised sparingly. The procedure is ill-suited for cases where the finding of unsustainability can only be reached upon a protracted hearing resembling a preliminary hearing by affidavit evidence on the merits of the case. The rationale for this is not difficult to appreciate, for a litigant should not be shut out from the judgment seat so summarily unless he obviously has no defensible case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> As regards <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i>, where they clearly apply on the facts, a subsequent action filed can be struck out as being scandalous or an abuse of court process. Counsel for the 1st respondent cites, <i>inter alia</i>, the House of Lords decision in <i>Hunter v. Chief Constable of West Midlands and Another</i> [1981] 3 All ER 727 as authority. Lord Diplock in that case, citing Lord Halsbury in <i>Raichel v. Magrath</i> [1889] 14 App Cas 665, held the view that "it would be a scandal to the administration of justice" to allow a matter to be relitigated. Acknowledging that a court should be slow to strike out a statement of claim, yet when "identical questions" are sought to be raised, it ought to do so.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> The determinative issue to be decided in this appeal is whether either <i>res judicata</i> or issue <i>estoppel</i>, or both, apply on the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> The present appellants, the plaintiffs in the High Court, were not all parties in the 2004 originating summons action, except possibly for 49 of them who now claim their signatures were forged on the Power of Attorney granting Mariayee the authority to institute the action on their behalf. However, as a matter of general principle of law, for <i>res judicata</i> or issue <i>estoppel</i> to apply, the parties in the subsequent action need not be identical. See, eg <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_2013_1_535;"><i>Rasamalar Gnanasundram v. Letha Madhavan &amp; Ors</i> [2013] 1 MLRH 535</LINK>; [2012] 10 CLJ 746:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> Typically, <i>res judicata</i> or "<i>estoppel</i> per rem judicatam" is identified with "cause of action <i>estoppel</i>", and operates in a situation where there is an identity of parties, although this principle cannot be stated without qualification, for the principle extends to persons who are "privies" or have a "privity in interest" as well. <i>Spenser Bower, Turner &amp; Handley, Res Judicata</i> (3rd edn) explains the principle thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Cause of action <i>estoppel</i> therefore prevents the "reassertion of the cause of action" whilst issue <i>estoppel</i> prevents the "contradiction of a previous determination." As a matter of nomenclature, cause of action <i>estoppel</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> may be said to be two separate components of <i>estoppel per rem judicatam</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> This appeal concerns more a question of issue <i>estoppel</i> rather than cause of action <i>estoppel</i>. The cause of action framed in the writ action, as seen earlier, is premised on breach of trust, invalidity of the sale and purchase agreement between Gatco and Thamarai and, as submitted, equitable fraud. The originating summons, on the other hand, was premised more on whether the settlers acquired a priority of interest. Nevertheless, the argument advanced by the parties being centred on issue <i>estoppel</i>, it becomes necessary to determine whether the same issues in both have been raised in the earlier action, and further, whether there have been final determinations in respect of these very issues. <i>Spenser Bower, Turner &amp; Handley, Res Judicata, (supra)</i>, addresses the problem in this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> Put in this way, the question becomes - are the issues now canvassed in the writ action also fundamental issues which formed an essential step in the reasoning which led to the decision in the originating summons action, or were they the basis of the earlier judgment?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> Spenser Bower, Turner &amp; Handley, Res Judicata, (supra), also cited the opinion proffered by Diplock LJ in <i>Thoday v. Thoday</i> [1964] P 181, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> On the issue of whether the present plaintiffs are "privies" or have a "privity in interest" with the plaintiffs in the origination summons action, the cases have not adopted a very wide concept for these terms. Counsel for the first respondent has referred us to the meaning of "privies" as expounded in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1993_1_142;"><i>Cheng Hang Guan &amp; Ors v. Perumahan Farlim (Penang) Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [1993] 1 MLRH 142</LINK>; [1993] 3 MLJ 352; [1994] 1 CLJ 19; [1994] 1 AMR 201, which in turn adopts the analysis of <i>Lord Reid in Carl-Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd</i> [1966] 2 All ER 536. To enumerate a few categories mentioned in <i>Carl-Zeiss Stiftung (supra)</i>, they include the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> From the above enumeration, it can be seen that there has to be more than "proof of curiosity or concern in the litigation" or just "some interest in the outcome" (<i>Gleeson v. J Wippell &amp; Co</i> [1977] 1 WLR 510. There has to be "a sufficient degree of identification between the two parties (per Megarry VC in <i>Gleeson (supra)</i>).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> The question to be asked in the context of this appeal is whether there exists that "sufficient degree of identification" between the plaintiffs in the originating summons action and the present plaintiffs in the writ action to make it just and reasonable that the present plaintiffs should be held bound by the outcome of the originating summons action?</p>
    <p>
      <b>H. Evaluation And Application Of The Law</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> We have to stress that for the purposes of this appeal, we make no determination on the substantive merits of the claim by the plaintiffs/appellants, nor of the defences of the defendants/respondents. Our primary concern is whether this claim is on its face an obviously unsustainable one, as the term is understood in law. The respondents argue that it is, since the matter is <i>res judicata</i> or barred by issue <i>estoppel</i>. It is said that the present appellants are "privies" or have a "privity in interest" with the originating summons plaintiffs, particularly when, it is alleged, 49 of the previous plaintiffs are also the plaintiffs in this present claim before us on appeal. The subject matter for both actions is the very same land and the very same land settlement scheme, the same indorsement on the title, and the same allegation that the land is subject to a constructive trust where Gatco is the constructive trustee and the settlers the beneficiaries. All the issues have, it is alleged, been decided by the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court in the earlier action. It is an accepted ground that the common party in both actions are the liquidators of Gatco. There is a hotly contested dispute whether the 49 plaintiffs in this action had authorised Mariayee to act as their attorney in the origination summons action. They claim their signatures have been forged. In any case, they are just 49 out of the 140 litigants in this appeal as appellants. By comparison, the total number of plaintiffs in the originating summons action was 214. Can the 140 plaintiffs/appellants now be regarded in law as "privies" or persons having a "privity in interest" with the previous plaintiffs? For a start, when some parties are now disputing their inclusion as plaintiffs in the previous action and alleging forgery, it will be stretching the term "privy" to regard them as "privies". Shortly put, no party can be compelled to accept a legal conclusion that he is a privy or share a privity in interest with another litigant by an alleged subterfuge - in this case, forgery. Whether this allegation is true or false will be a finding of fact on the evidence to be fully ventilated by a trial process. It cannot be disposed of by a summary process. We cannot agree with the finding of the learned Judicial Commissioner that this fact is not material in relation to the ultimate outcome of the decision in the earlier action. <i>Res judicata</i> is essentially an equitable doctrine founded on considerations of public policy. "In modern terms, it is against public policy, and oppressive to the individual, to re-agitate disputes which have been litigated to a conclusion." (<i>Spenser Bower, Turner &amp; Handley, Res Judicata (supra)</i>, p 4) There could be situations when an overly rigid adherence to the doctrine can lead to oppression to a party, in which event it may be inequitable to apply it unquestioningly. We have been referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2001_1_98;"><i>Chee Pok Choy &amp; Ors v. Scotch Leasing Sdn Bhd</i> [2001] 1 MLRA 98</LINK>; [2001] 4 MLJ 346; [2001] 2 CLJ 321; [2001] 3 AMR 2609, and the following passage in the judgment:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> This reminder is particularly relevant on the facts of this appeal. We have elaborated at some length on the legal requirements to support a finding of "privy" or "privity in interest", and have emphasised the point that it is not satisfied just by arguing a later party has "some interest in the outcome" of an earlier action. There has to be a real "identification of interest", as the term is understood in law. Although the parties in both have a broad identity of interest in terms of the land and the land settlement scheme, we remind ourselves that this appeal is not dealing with that interest in the abstract but as a finding of the courts in the originating summons action. Quite apart from the issue of forgery, this question is tied up closely with the question of what were the legal issues which could be deduced as finally determined by the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court in the originating summons action. This broaches the area of issue <i>estoppel</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> To apply issue <i>estoppel</i>, it will become necessary to define clearly what are the issues which were finally decided by the earlier court so as to be held binding on a later court. There cannot be an issue <i>estoppel</i> if the issue or issues have not received a final determination. On a broader basis, the doctrine can apply if the issues or issues were fundamental issues which formed an essential step in the reasoning which led to the decision in the earlier action, or were the basis of the earlier judgment. We have adverted to the authorities on this point earlier in our judgment. We have also analysed the basis of reasoning of the earlier Court of Appeal in the originating summons action, and the issues which were the issues to be argued before the Federal Court. In the absence of the written grounds of the Federal Court, we can only assume that the Federal Court must have agreed with the basis of argument and the findings of the Court of Appeal on the several issues before the Court of Appeal. To recapitulate, these were the grounds of the earlier Court of Appeal decision:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> It does not appear conspicuously that the issue of breach of the constructive trust formed a fundamental part or basis of the earlier reasoning. Priority of interest of the settlers was. It was, however, a fundamental part of the reasoning that the rights and interests of the other settlers who were non-parties would be affected by the decision and the plaintiffs had failed to provide full and concise particulars of the intended purchasers, and failed to provide any other information of other settlers not made plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> It is necessary to define with precision the exact issues which were determined by the earlier courts. We have done precisely that. At the present stage of the proceedings, which is limited to a consideration whether the case is obviously unsustainable, we are unable to conclude that it is plain and clear that the same issues were canvassed before the earlier courts or formed the basis of the earlier decision. On the contrary, on a <i>prima facie</i> basis, they do not appear to be so. In our view, when the learned Judicial Commissioner concluded that the issue of constructive trust and its breach was decided in the earlier action and therefore <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> applied, there was a clear misdirection on the facts and the law by the court which invites appellate intervention on our part.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> We have to again stress that we are dealing with an interlocutory appeal, and therefore make no final findings of facts and the several issues of law pertaining to the present claim by the 140 plaintiffs, or the defences of the respondents. We are merely concluding in this appeal that in the totality of the circumstances, the facts and the applicable law, we do not find the claim of the present plaintiffs/appellants to be <i>prima facie</i> obviously unsustainable that it has to be summarily struck out under O 18 r 19(1). The defendants/ respondents can still introduce evidence and submit on the issues of <i>res judicata</i> and issue <i>estoppel</i> during the trial, whilst giving the plaintiffs/appellants the full benefit of having their opportunity to fully ventilate their claim, including the allegation of equitable fraud involving the 1st and 2nd respondents, and not be just summarily dismissed on contested affidavit evidence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>I. Conclusion And Orders</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> For the reasons and on the basis of our analysis of the facts and the applicable law as considered above, we are allowing this appeal with costs in the cause.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> The orders of the High Court dated 19 June 2013 striking out the plaintiffs' writ and statement of claim (in relation to encls 7 and 10), inclusive of the orders on costs in the High Court, are therefore set aside. The claim of the plaintiffs is reinstated. We further order that the case be remitted back to the High Court to be tried before a different High Court Judge.</p>
