    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The Court of Appeal would agree with the judge that the appellant's defence was unbelievable, illogical, devoid of merit and thus ought to be rejected. (para 25)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> Upon considering the defence case with the whole evidence adduced by the prosecution, the appellant had failed to cast any reasonable doubt on the truth of the prosecution's case. The prosecution had thus proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. (para 27)</p>

      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant, Lim Eng Tiong was indicted with four offences under three separate charges, namely, Perak Criminal Trial Nos: 45-1-2007, 45-08-2007 and 45-08-2008. The first amended charge, second charge, third charge and fourth charge are produced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The four charges were jointly tried under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;170.;;">s 170 of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK></p>
    <p>
      <b>The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> On 12 June 2006, at about 6.30pm, while on duty at Balai Polis Kuala Sepetang, Copral Mokhtar bin Md Saad (SP3) received a call from a member of the public informing him that a male Chinese was in possession of drugs and a pistol at Kampung Seberang, Kuala Sepetang. The information was relayed to the Officer in Charge of Police Station, Sergeant Major Roslan Maddany who instructed SP3 to get the reinforcement of personnel from IPD Taiping.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> While giving his briefing to the reinforcement personnel, SP3 received a second call telling him that the suspect had landed at Kampung Dapur Arang, Kuala Sepetang. A police party consisting of ASP Helmi bin Ahmad (SP9), Lance Copral Haslan bin Lamkasah (SP5), Copral Mohd Nasir bin Abu Bakar (SP6), Copral Rosli bin Abdul Ghani (SP7) and SP3 rushed to the said place on motorcycles.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> On arrival at Kampung Baru Dapur Arang, SP6 noticed a male Chinese whose descriptions had fitted the information received by SP3. The suspect was walking alone. As the police approached the suspect, one of the members of the police team shouted "Berhenti Polis!". Immediately the suspect started to run. At the same time SP6 and SP7 noticed the fire splinters/sparks (percikan api) followed by a gunshot. SP6 and SP5 gave chase on a motorcycle, whilst SP7 and Lance Copral Hanafiah chased the suspect on foot.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> Along the way, Beh Eng Hock (SP4) and Lim Liang Seng @ Ah Seng were riding a Suzuki motorcycle, WBR 7170. SP4 was the pillion rider. The suspect who was running from the back, grabbed the motorcycle. SP4 and Ah Seng alighted from the motorcycle. The motorcycle was robbed by the suspect. SP4 could not identify the suspect, the suspect was seen holding something which looked like a pistol, but SP4 was not certain what it was.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> SP6 and SP5 continued to chase the suspect who was heading to the main road of Kuala Sepetang town. Upon arrival at Simpang traffic light, SP6 got close to the suspect's motorcycle and he jumped onto the suspect. Both of them fell on the left side of the road. A scuffle ensued between SP6 and the suspect. The suspect was holding a pistol. In the meantime, SP5 and SP7 came to assist and grappled with the suspect. SP6 managed to wrest the black revolver exh P21B from the grip of the suspect's left hand and recovered a blue cloth bag of 'Giordano' brand from the suspect's left trousers' pocket containing six rounds of ammunition.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The particulars of the revolver were 38 Special Colt Police Positive Special, serial no 593211 (exh P21B). On examining its chamber, it was found to contain five spent ammunitions (exhs P23A-E) and one round of live ammunition exh P23F. In the blue cloth 'Giordano' bag, it was found to contain six rounds of live ammunitions (exhs P24A-E and P24K).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The suspect was arrested. His hands was handcuffed. The suspect's name was Lim Eng Tiong. He was the appellant. The revolver and ammunitions which were seized by SP6 were handed over to SP9. SP9 also found a light brown holster on the road where the appellant fell.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> A police report was lodged by SP9 pertaining to the incident, the arrest of the appellant and the seizure of the firearm and ammunitions vide Simpang Report No: 107/06, P30 and likewise another police report was also made by SP6 vide Simpang Report No: 108/06, P33.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> On 13 January 2006, at about 3.00am, SP9 handed the appellant and all the exhibits to the Investigating Officer, ASP Rosli bin Hamid (SP10) at the latter's office.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 24 March 2006 the revolver exh P21B and six rounds of ammunitions exhs P24A-E and P24K were sent to the government chemist (ballistics), SP8 for serviceability test. SP8 test-fired the revolver exh P21B using five rounds of live ammunitions exhs P24AE and SP8 found that the revolver exh P21B and the ammunitions P24A-E were in working order and shots could be discharged. There were explosion of all the test-fired ammunitions. SP8, therefore concluded that the revolver P21B was in serviceable condition. SP8 also confirmed that the five spent ammunitions exhs P23A-E were having the same characteristic features among themselves and also having the same characteristic features with exhs P24A-E. Therefore, SP8 also opined that the ammunitions exhs P23A-E were fired from the revolver exh P21B.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of The High Court At The Close Of The Prosecution's Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> At the close of the prosecution's case, the trial judge found there was insufficient credible evidence adduced by the prosecution under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1999_593;180.;;">s 180(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code</LINK> to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The prosecution's version was doubtful, having regard to the evidence of a civilian witness, SP4 and the lighting conditions at the scene. The evidence relating to the arrest and seizure of the firearms were unbelievable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The discrepancies in exhs P31, P31A, B and P9, the sketch plans, P26, P32 and P34, coupled with a poor investigation by the Investigating Officer in a serious robbery case like this case. The photographs of the scenes were taken more than two years after the incident.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The prosecution has failed to prove a <i>prima facie</i> case on all the charges proffered against the appellant. The appellant was acquitted and discharged without calling for his defence.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Appeal was lodged to the Court of Appeal by the prosecution. Having re-evaluated and considered the prosecution evidence, the Court of Appeal on 24 March 2014 set aside the order of acquittal by the trial judge and ordered that the appellant's defence be called and remitted the case back to the High Court to be heard by another High Court Judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Defence Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> The appellant gave evidence on oath. The appellant's defence was simple. The appellant did not deny:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The appellant's story was not much of a difference with the prosecution's version. The stark difference is that the appellant denied he was in possession of the revolver and ammunitions as alleged by the prosecution.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> At the time of incident, according to the appellant he was carrying a bag containing some cash which he received from his employer. The bag also contained his identity card and the handphone. He emphasised that it was impossible for him to fire the shots at the police who chased him. Neither the appellant exhibited any firearm at SP4 at the time he took the motorcycle from SP4.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Findings Of Trial Judge At The Conclusion Of The Trial</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The appellant denied that he was in possession of a revolver P21B as well as the ammunitions. Having considered the defence case, the trial judge found that the appellant's defence was a mere denial. The trial judge cited the Court of Appeal case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_555;"><i>Ali Tan Abdullah v. PP</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 555</LINK>; [2013] 2 MLJ 676; [2013] 4 CLJ 757; [2013] 1 AMR 289 wherein Azahar Mohamed JCA said:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On the totality of the evidence and upon consideration of all the evidence before the court, the trial judge found that the appellant had failed to cast any reasonable doubt on all the four charges preferred against the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> In the result, the trial judge concluded that the prosecution has succeeded to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant. The appellant was found guilty, convicted and sentenced him as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Before us, learned counsel canvassed several issues, namely:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Findings</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The appellant did not deny that he was at the scene. He had just returned from work as a fisherman. According to the appellant, he was waiting for his friend to pick him up when several men ran after him. He thought that they were robbers to rob him. He was scared. The appellant ran through the nearby 'lorong' until he came across two unknown motorcyclists. He "took" the motorcycle to make good his escape. Learned deputy has suggested that the appellant had robbed the motorcycle at gun point or exhibited the pistol and threatened the said motorcyclist. The appellant's version that he seized the motorcycle without any force and threat was hard to believe in the circumstances of this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> The trial judge found that the appellant's defence was unbelievable, illogical and devoid of merit. His defence that he was not in possession and/or discharging the firearm at the police or exhibiting the firearm to SP4 while committing the robbery of the motorcycle was a bare denial. The trial judge who enjoyed the audiovisual evidence before him rejected the defence case. We agreed with His Lordship. </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The non-calling of Lim Liang Seng does not warrant the invocation of adverse inference under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;114.;;">s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> as there is no element of withholding or suppression of evidence, and not merely on account of failure to obtain evidence. It is not fatal to the prosecution. Neither the investigations into this case by the Investigating Officer, ASP Rosli bin Hamid (SP10) cannot be accused of being unsatisfactory. Further, there are also no serious gaps in the chain of evidence with regard to the exhibits, especially the revolver exh P21B. The revolver exh P21B was properly marked and identified by its serial numbers 593211: see Supreme Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1992_1_516;"><i>Sun Kam Heng v. Public Prosecutor</i> [1992] 1 MLRA 516</LINK>; [1992] 2 MLJ 826; [1993] 1 CLJ 109; [1993] 1 AMR 49. The serviceability of the revolver exh P21B and the seven rounds of live ammunitions, exhs P23A-E, P23F, P24A-E and P24K were not challenged by the defence. Before the revolver exh P21B was testfired, SP8 found that there was gun shots residue inside its 4 - inch barrel, indicating that there were explosions taken place. In other words, it is reasonable to infer that the revolver exh P21B which was seized from the appellant's left hand was fired by him. Moreover, during the chase there were fire splinters/sparks (percikan api) that were seen by the prosecution witnesses and followed by the gunshot. The police did not loose sight of the appellant from the moment they saw the appellant until the appellant was pounced and arrested by SP6.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Upon considering the defence case with the whole evidence adduced by the prosecution, the appellant has failed to cast any reasonable doubt on the truth of the prosecution's case. The prosecution has thus proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> There is no basis on the allegation or insinuation that the prosecution witnesses had conspired and fabricated the evidence against the appellant. The material witnesses for the prosecution, SP6, SP7 and SP9 are police officers who performed their duties fearlessly as servants of the law. The police officers had no axe to grind against the appellant as they were complete strangers. We are in agreement with what was said in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1998_3_562;"><i>PP v. David Ackowuah Bonsu</i> [1998] 3 MLRH 562</LINK>; [1999] 2 MLJ 677; [1999] 2 CLJ 677.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> Having considered the factual matrix of this case, we were unanimous in our view that the trial judge had not committed any appealable errors warranting our interference. We, therefore, dismissed the appellant's appeal and affirmed the convictions and sentences imposed by the High Court.</p>
