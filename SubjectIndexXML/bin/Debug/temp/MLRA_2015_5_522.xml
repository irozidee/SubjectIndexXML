    <p>The respondent/applicant had applied to have some land - then known as Lot PT 15024 ("the Subject Land") measuring some 14,827sqm - alienated to it for the purpose of constructing a religious school as well as a hostel and related infrastructure. On 22 October 2003, the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant informed the applicant that the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant had approved its application. The applicant then proceeded to construct buildings and infrastructure on a portion of the land (Part A). The remaining portion (Part B) was not developed by the applicant as there were squatters on that portion. On or about 17 February 2012, the applicant came to know that Part B was being claimed by others who alleged that that portion had been alienated to them. The applicant discovered through a Land Office search that Part B had indeed been subdivided into five separate lots ("the Disputed Lots") - each with its own provisional title. Consequently Lot PT 15024 had become reduced in size and had in fact become Lot PT 14863, with an area of approximately 9,172sqm. The applicant applied for judicial review to <i>inter alia</i>, declare the decision alienating the five lots to be null and void and of no effect. The applicant also sought to compel the appellants/State authorities to revoke the registration of the titles granted to those persons, and to compel the State authorities to alienate the land to the applicant instead. The applicant claimed to have legitimate expectation that the land would be alienated to it. Its basis for claiming to have such legitimate expectation was its application for the Subject Land in 2003. The applicant further claimed that the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's letter dated 22 October 2003 constituted an undertaking or promise that the Subject Land would be alienated to it. It was pursuant to such undertaking or promise that the applicant built the buildings and infrastructure on Part A of the Subject Land. The Land Administrator testified that the approval of the Subject Land to the applicant in 2003 was in the form of a Temporary Occupation Licence ("TOL"). The Subject Land was subjected to a re-survey in 2010 to implement a decision of the State Executive Council to create a Group Resettlement Scheme and in consequence of that it became reduced in size and was given the new number PT14863. The Land Administrator further averred that the applicant's TOL had expired on 31 December 2004 and no application for its extension was ever made by the applicant. The applicant had also never made any application for the alienation of the Subject Land to it. The High Court allowed the applicant's application and the appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The reliefs prayed for by the applicant had the effect of adversely affecting the rights of the five individuals to whom the five separate lots were alienated. None of them was served with Form 111B or the accompanying cause papers and none sought to be heard under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 8 of the Rules of the High Court 1980</LINK>. The High Court had erred in making the orders which had the effect of taking away the registered rights of the five individuals without them being given the right to be heard. (paras 41-46)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The applicant's claim of legitimate expectation was a claim in equity. In the instant case, there was nothing in any of the affidavits to show that the State authorities had ever made any promise that the Subject Land would be alienated to the applicant. All the State authorities did was to allow the buildings to remain on the Subject Land and to allow the applicant to operate the school and hostel on the land without any payment to the State. The fact remained that the applicant did not apply for the extension of the TOL and did not apply for the alienation of the Subject Land. It only bestirred itself after finding out about the alienation of the disputed lots to the five individuals. Even then, there was no evidence that it made any effort to apply for the alienation of the land on which its buildings stood. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the applicant's claim of legitimate expectation should have been dismissed by the High Court. (paras 57, 62, 63 &amp; 64)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> The applicant was only granted a TOL over the Subject Land and that TOL had lapsed almost seven years before the alienation of the Disputed Lots. No part of the Subject Land had ever been alienated to the applicant or reserved for its purpose under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code ("NLC")</LINK>. The applicant had never made any application for the alienation of the Subject Land to it. There was nothing under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> requiring the State Authorities to give the opportunity to any occupant of any State land to be heard before the land was alienated. In the instant case, the applicant did not even occupy that portion of the Subject Land that became the Disputed Lots. The acts of the State Authorities re-surveying and re-delineating the boundaries of its own property could not constitute a <i>mala fide</i> act. In the first place, the applicant had no right over the land, not even the right of occupation upon the expiry of the TOL. The alienation of the disputed lots was well within the statutory powers of the State authorities. The alienation could not therefore be said to be unreasonable. (paras 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 74 &amp; 75)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> There was nothing in the alienation of the disputed lots that showed the State authorities had acted in excess of the powers given to them by Parliament in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK>. (para 80)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> In the instant case, the applicant did not contend that the five individuals had obtained titles to the disputed lots by fraud, misrepresentation or by means of an insufficient or void instrument. Neither were the titles obtained unlawfully through any purported exercise of any power or authority conferred by any written law. There was therefore no legal basis for the order made by the High Court compelling the revocation of the titles in respect of the disputed lots registered in the names of the five individuals. (paras 83-85)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> As the High Court's order had the effect of depriving the five individuals of their property in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340 of the NLC</LINK>, and the other provisions of the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> did not apply in the instant case and this was not an order made in a land acquisition proceeding, the revocation order was clearly contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Zaharah Ibrahim JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This was an appeal against the part of the decision of the High Court of Malaya at Kuala Terengganu allowing the application of the respondent (in a judicial review application) and granting the following orders:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> We had unanimously allowed the appeal. The orders of appealed against were set aside.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> For ease of reference we shall refer to the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> appellants collectively in this judgment as the "State authorities". We shall refer to the respondent as the "applicant".</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> Sometime in 2003, the applicant applied to have a parcel of land ["Subject Land"] then known as Lot PT 15024 alienated to it for the purpose of constructing a religious school as well as a hostel for orphans and related infrastructure. That parcel of land had an area of approximately 14,827 square metres.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The applicant received a letter dated 22 October 2003 from the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant (the Land Administrator) informing it that its application had been approved by the State Executive Council (the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The applicant then proceeded to construct buildings and infrastructure on a portion of the Subject Land. In its statement ["statement"] under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(2) of the Rules of the High Court 1980 ["RHC 1980"]</LINK> that portion was referred to as Part A. The applicant claimed to have expended a sum of approximately RM700,000.00 for the buildings and infrastructure.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The remaining portion (referred to as Part B in the statement) of the Subject Land was not "developed" by the applicant as there were squatters on that portion. The applicant planned to build an orphanage and a car park on that portion.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On or about 17 February 2012, the applicant came to know that Part B was being claimed by other persons who said that that Part had been alienated to them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The applicant conducted a search at the land Office and discovered that that Part B had indeed been alienated to five individuals. Part B had been subdivided into five separate Lots, each with its own provisional title.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> Consequently Lot PT 15024 had become reduced in size and had in fact now become lot PT 14863, with an area of approximately 9,172 square metres.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The applicant therefore commenced these judicial review proceedings.</p>
    <p>
      <b>At The High Court</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Application</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The principal reliefs claimed by the applicant in its application for Judicial Review ["application"] were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> The five lots of land the alienation of which the applicant sought to have revoked were PT 9829, PT 9830, PT 9831, PT 9832 and PT 9833 ["Disputed Lots"]. The disputed lots were alienated to Rosli bin Hashim, Muhamad bin Idris, Suhaini binti Abd Karim, Ibrahim bin Abdullah, and Abd Ghani bin Muda, respectively [the "five individuals"].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> The applicant claimed to have legitimate expectation that the Subject Land would be alienated to it. Its basis for claiming to have such legitimate expectation was its application for the Subject Land in 2003.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> The applicant further claimed that the 3<sup>rd</sup> appellant's letter dated 22 October 2003 constituted an undertaking/promise that the Subject Land would be alienated to it. It was pursuant to such undertaking/promise that it built the buildings and infrastructure on Part A of the Subject Land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Affidavit Evidence</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> In support of the application, an affidavit was affirmed by Encik Jamaludin bin Jusoh, a Director of the applicant, essentially restating the contents of the application and the statement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> An affidavit in reply was affirmed by Tuan Haji Mohd Akil bin Hj Mat, the then Land Administrator of the District of Dungun. According to the Land Administrator, the disputed lots were part of 41 lots in a Group Settlement Scheme known as Rancangan Tanah Berkelompok Kolam Permai ["RTB Kolam Permai"] approved by the State Executive Council on 20 August 1997.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> The approval of Lot PT 15024 (the Subject Land) to the applicant in 2003 for the purpose of constructing Sekolah Islam Darul Bayan was in the form of a "Lesen Menduduki Sementara" or Temporary Occupation Licence ["TOL"].</p>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> The Subject Land was subjected to re-survey in 2010 in order to implement the 1997 decision of the State Executive Council creating the RTB Kolam Permai. It was in consequence of that exercise that the Subject Land became reduced in size and was given a new number, namely PT 14863.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The Land Administrator further averred in his affidavit that the applicant's TOL had expired on 31 December 2004 and no application for its extension was ever made by the applicant. The applicant had also never made any application for the alienation of the Subject Land to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> In response, Encik Jamaludin affirmed another affidavit claiming that there was no application made for the extension of the TOL due to the State Government freezing all such applications as could be seen from the letter dated 23 March 2004 exhibited as "JJ-9".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> Encik Jamaluddin also claimed that the applicant did not apply for the alienation of the Subject Land as the Land Administrator and State Government departments refused to deal with the applicant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Encik Jamaludin refuted the Land Administrator's claim that the re-survey and subsequent alienation of the disputed lots to the five individuals were for the purpose of complying with the State Executive Council's decision in 1997 on the creation of the RTB Kolam Permai. He claimed that the participants of the RTB Kolam Permai who were given TOLs had already begun to have the relevant lots alienated to them from 2010 if they had built buildings on the lots. The lots on which no buildings had been erected were not yet alienated. However, the disputed lots were alienated eventhough the five individuals did not build any building on the Lots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> A further supporting affidavit was affirmed by Encik Norulalzahar bin Ali who stated that he was a member of the District Council of Dungun from 1999 until 2004 and had personal knowledge that the selection of participants for the RTB Kolam Permai was done in the year 2000 and 33 participants were chosen and given TOLs. The disputed lots were not among the lots allocated to the 33 participants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> Documents marked "JJ-1" to "JJ-9" were exhibited in Encik Jamaludin's affidavits, and documents marked "TMA-1" to "TMA-3" were exhibited in the Land Administrator's affidavit. The list of successful participants for RTB Kolam Permai was exhibited as "NBA-1" in Encik Norulalzahar's affidavit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>High Court Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> The learned High Court Judge determined that the issues needed to be determined were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> The learned High Court Judge, having taken into account the act of the applicant in constructing the buildings and infrastructure on the Subject Land and expending about RM700,000.00 in the process, and taken into account the Land Administrator's letter dated 20 October 2003, concluded that the applicant was occupying the Subject Land lawfully.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> Relying on the Federal Court case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_207;"><i>North East Plantations Sdn Bhd lwn. Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Dungun &amp; Satu Lagi</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 207</LINK>, the learned High Court Judge answered the first two questions in the affirmative.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> His Lordship acknowledged that legitimate expectation could prevail over statutory powers given to the State Authority as provided for in the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">National Land Code ["NLC"]</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As the Subject Land was still State land, the alienation of the disputed lots to the five individuals was valid and they obtained indefeasible title over the Disputed Lots. His Lordship referred to <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2010_1_1;"><i>Tan Ying Hong v. Tan Sian San &amp; Ors</i> [2010] 1 MLRA 1</LINK>; [2010] 2 MLJ 1; [2010] 2 CLJ 269.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> However, the learned High Court Judge, citing <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1978_1_132;"><i>Pengarah Tanah Dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd</i> [1978] 1 MLRA 132</LINK>; [1979] 1 MLJ 135 made the following findings:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The learned High Court Judge consequently concluded that based on those findings the reliefs as prayed in paras (a), (b) and (c) of the application ought to be allowed, and were allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The State authorities appealed against that decision to this court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>In The Court Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Grounds Of Appeal</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> Our summary of the grounds of appeal is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Analysis</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> After reading the Record of Appeal and reading and hearing the submissions of the parties, we were of the view that we ought to deal with this appeal by first addressing issues relating to procedure and then issues relating to the law.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Wrong Parties?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> As a preliminary matter, we would like to state that we were rather surprised that no objection was taken in the court below or before us that the State authorities named as respondents in the application were the wrong parties to be cited as respondents as the legal entity which had the power and which in fact alienated the disputed lots was the State Authority. Under the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;;">NLC</LINK> only the State Authority has the power to alienate land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> In <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;5.;;">s 5 of the NLC</LINK> the term "State Authority" is defined as "the Ruler or Governor of the State, as the case may be".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> However, as this was not an issue raised before us, we did not take this into account in arriving at our decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>
        <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">Order 53 Rule 4(2) Of The RHC 1980</LINK>
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> This application was filed in on 25 March 2012. Hence the <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;;">Rules of the High Court 1980 [RHC 1980]</LINK> were the applicable rules.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 4 of the RHC 1980</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> The reliefs prayed for by the applicant would have the effect (and in fact did have the effect) of adversely affecting the rights of the five individuals to whom the disputed lots were alienated. The applicant sought to have such alienation quashed, thus depriving the five individuals of their rights over the Disputed Lots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> The names of the five individuals were set out in the statement. So were the fact that they were either members of the JKKK of their respective village or the spouses of members of the JKKK of their respective village. In other words, the applicant knew who they were and how to reach them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> Yet none of them was served with Form 111B or the accompanying cause papers. Quite obviously therefore none appeared at the hearing of the application and sought to be heard under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 8 of the RHC 1980</LINK>.</p>

      <b>[44]</b> We found it regretful that the learned High Court Judge could overlook the requirement of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 4 of the RHC 1980</LINK> especially in view of the reliefs claimed which would have adverse effect against the five individuals if granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> In the haste to grant the natural justice claimed by the applicant, the natural justice that must be accorded to the five individuals who were registered proprietors of the disputed lots was denied.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> In our view, the learned High Court Judge erred in making the orders which had the effect of taking away the registered rights of the five individuals without them being given the right to be heard.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Legitimate Expectation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> The applicant's claim of legitimate expectation to be alienated the Subject Land rested on the following facts:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>The Letter Dated 22 October 2003 And The TOL</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> The letter dated 22 October 2003 was exhibited as exh "JJ-1" in Encik Jamaludin's affidavit in support.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> That letter merely informed the applicant that its application in relation to the Subject Land "untuk Bangunan Sekolah Darul Bayan" was approved but only a TOL for a period of three years would be granted. The applicant was required to build the school within three years, failing which a further period of three years would be granted. Should there be no building erected, there would be no further extension granted.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> A TOL was subsequently issued on 18 November 2003 as could be seen from exh "JJ-1". The TOL would only be valid until 31 December 2003. In other words, it was only valid for barely 1½ months. This was consistent with the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;67.;;">subsections 67 of the NLC</LINK> which provides that a TOL "shall be issued for a term expiring not later than the end of the calendar year in which it commences". But it may be renewed annually.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> The TOL was renewed and the new term expired on 31 December 2004. There was no averment in any of the affidavits for the applicant to show that the TOL was further renewed. In fact, Encik Jamaludin in his second affidavit confirmed that there was no application made for such renewal as the State Government had decided in March 2004 to freeze approvals for such applications. A letter signed by the Director of Land and Mines dated 23 March 2004 addressed to the Land Administrators of the various districts in Terengganu and copied to the State Secretary and the State Legal Adviser was exhibited in that affidavit as exh "JJ-9".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> We must admit to being rather perplexed as to how a letter addressed only to Land Administrators in the State and copied only to the State Secretary and the State Legal Adviser could be exhibited in that affidavit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[53]</b> There did not appear to be any move by the applicant to apply for the extension of the TOL or for the alienation of the Subject Land despite para 2 of the letter in "JJ-9" stating the "freeze" was only temporary. In fact, in his second affidavit, the Land Administrator averred that the "freeze" was lifted with effect from 6 September 2004 as could be seen from the letter exhibited as exh "TMA-3".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[54]</b> It was clear that from 1 January 2005 until this Application was filed, the applicant was occupying the Subject Land without any statutory licence or title.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[55]</b> All it had was an approval for TOL, and a TOL which had expired.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[56]</b> The State Authority had, for reasons best known to itself, allowed the buildings and infrastructure to remain even after the TOL had lapsed, and after the alienation of part of the Subject Lot to the five individuals. The buildings which now lie partly outside the new Lot PT 14863 had also remained undisturbed by the State Authority.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Finding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[57]</b> The applicant's claim of legitimate expectation was, in our view, a claim in equity. Claims similar to this but on stronger footing were dealt with by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1984_1_61;"><i>Government Of The State Of Negeri Sembilan v. Yap Chong Lan &amp; Ors. &amp; Another Case</i> [1984] 1 MLRA 61</LINK>; [1984] 2 MLJ 123; [1984] 1 CLJ 144.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[58]</b> In that case, the land on which the respondents built houses and paid ground rent to the owner was acquired. They were allotted lots on a piece of land in Ulu Temiang for resettlement and allowed by the Collector to build houses on those lots. The land was subsequently alienated to Lesco and the respondents, and others occupying other lots on that land, were ordered to leave but offered compensation and options to purchase low cost houses in the proposed housing estate to be developed on that land. The respondents refused the offer. They contended that they were permitted to stay there on a permanent basis with a promise that titles would be granted to them for the lots they occupied. They then commenced proceedings against the State Government and Lesco. One of the issues raised for determination by the Federal Court was whether the respondents had acquired an equitable right or interest to remain on the lots allocated to them.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[59]</b> The Federal Court, citing <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;48.;;">s 48</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;78.;;">subsection 78(3) of the NLC</LINK> held, at p 66, that those "statutory provisions by themselves would appear to provide a complete answer to and inhibit the interpolation of any equity with regard to the respondents' claim. There can be no intervention by equity in the face of the specific legislative provisions of the Code".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[60]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;48.;;">s 48 of the National Land Code</LINK>, "No title to State Land shall be acquired by possession, unlawful occupation or occupation under any licence for any period whatsoever".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[61]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;78.;;">Subsection 78(3)</LINK> provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[62]</b> In the case before us, there was nothing in any of the affidavits to show that the State authorities had ever made any promise that the Subject Land (or even what remained of it in the form of Lot PT 14863) would be alienated to the applicant. All the State authorities did was to allow the buildings to remain on the Subject Land and to allow the applicant to operate the School and hostel on the land without any payment to the State.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[63]</b> The fact remained that the applicant did not apply for the extension of the TOL and did not apply for the alienation of the Subject Land. It only bestirred itself after finding out about the alienation of the disputed lots to the five individuals. Even then, there was no evidence that it made any effort to apply for the alienation of the land on which its buildings stood. It merely claimed, without any evidence in support, that the Land Administrator and the other State Government departments refused to deal with it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[64]</b> We were therefore of the considered view that based on the facts and the applicable law, the applicant's claim of legitimate expectation should have been dismissed by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[65]</b> In any case, the applicant's claim for an order of <i>mandamus</i> to compel the State authorities to take the necessary steps to alienate the Subject Land to it within 21 days from the date of the order was dismissed by the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Alienation Of Disputed Lots</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[66]</b> The learned High Court Judge in his judgment held that the alienation of the disputed lots to the five individuals was made arbitrarily, unfairly, unreasonably and discriminatorily.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Finding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[67]</b> As we have discussed above, the applicant was only granted a TOL over the Subject Land and that TOL had lapsed almost seven years before the alienation of the Disputed Lots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[68]</b> No part of the Subject Land had ever been alienated to the applicant or reserved for its purpose under the NLC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[69]</b> Unlike the respondents in the case of <i>Government Of The State Of Negeri Sembilan v. Yap Chong Lan &amp; Ors &amp; Another Case (supra)</i>, the applicant had never made any application for the alienation of the Subject Land to it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[70]</b> The Subject Land was without a doubt State Land when the disputed lots were carved out of the Subject Land after the resurvey and subsequently alienated to the five individuals in November and December 2011.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[71]</b> There is nothing under Part Five of the NLC requiring the State Authority to give the opportunity to any occupant of any State land to be heard before that land is alienated. In the case before us, the applicant did not even occupy that portion of the Subject Land that became the disputed lots.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[72]</b> We were quite taken aback by the finding of the learned High Court Judge that the act of re-surveying the Subject Land and redelineating the boundaries of the Subject Land without informing Darul Bayan was a <i>mala fide</i> act with the intention of denying the rights of the applicant who was already occupying the land ("satu tindakan yang <i>mala fide</i> bertujuan menafikan hak pemohon yang telah pun menduduki tanah tersebut").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[73]</b> Property in the Subject Land being then wholly State land was vested solely in the State authority by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;40.;;">s 40 of the NLC</LINK>. Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;41.;;">ss 41</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;42.;;">42 of the NLC</LINK> the State Authority had the power of disposal over the State land vested in it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[74]</b> How could the act of the State Authority re-surveying and redelineating the boundaries of its own property be a <i>mala fide</i> act? How could that act be an act done with the object of denying the right of the applicant who in the first place had no right over the land, not even the right of occupation upon the expiry of the TOL?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[75]</b> The alienation of the disputed lots was well within the statutory powers of the State Authority. That alienation could not therefore be said to be unreasonable ("tidak munasabah") purely because the State authorities knew that Darul Bayan was occupying part of the Subject Land.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[76]</b> The disputed lots were outside the actual area occupied by the applicant's. Even after the alienation of the disputed lots to the five individuals, the applicant's occupation of the remainder of the Subject Lot remained undisturbed despite it having no TOL nor title over that remainder. We were unable to fathom in what way the alienation of the disputed lots to the five individuals could have "mengenepikan hak-hak majoriti".</p>
    <p>
      <b>[77]</b> We have no reason to disagree with the pronouncements of the eminent members of the Federal Court in <i>Pengarah Tanah Dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd (supra)</i>, relied upon by the learned High Court Judge. Indeed, we are bound by the Federal Court decision in that case. However, that case had nothing to do with the alienation of State land under the NLC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[78]</b>
      <i>Sri Lempah's</i> case was a case involving an application for subdivision under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;137.;;">s 137 of the NLC</LINK>. Sri Lempah applied to surrender part of its land (held under a title in perpetuity) to the Government for use as roads, side lanes and back lanes. The land Executive Committee of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur imposed certain conditions in relation to the surrender of the title for the purpose of subdividing the land and in particular carving out the part to be surrendered for the roads and lanes. The condition that was in issue in that case was the condition that upon the balance being returned to Sri Lempah, the returned land would have a title of 99 years only instead of the original title in perpetuity.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[79]</b> In that case, the Federal Court remitted back the applications by Sri Lempah to the land Executive Committee for "reconsideration in accordance with the law", because, as stated by His Lordship Suffian LP in that case, quoting Lord Greene MR in <i>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation</i> [1947] 2 All ER 685:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[80]</b> We could find nothing in the alienation of the disputed lots that showed the State Authority had acted in excess of the powers given to it by Parliament in the NLC.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Revocation Of The Alienation Of The Disputed Lots</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[81]</b> The learned High Court Judge had answered in the affirmative the question whether the five individuals had indefeasible title over the disputed lots yet, the orders made were clearly in contradiction to that answer.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[82]</b> The documents exhibited in the affidavit in support of the application showed that the five individuals had become registered proprietors of the disputed lots on 28 November 2011, 5 December 2011, 6 December 2011 and 7 December 2011 (two Lots).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Finding</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[83]</b> Under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340(2) of the NLC</LINK>, the title of any of the five individuals was only defeasible in any of the following three situations:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[84]</b> In this case, the applicant did not contend that the five individuals obtained the titles to the disputed lots by fraud, misrepresentation or by means of an insufficient or void instrument. The third situation was not applicable to the circumstances of this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[85]</b> There was therefore no legal basis for the order made by the learned High Court Judge compelling the revocation of the titles in respect of the disputed lots which had been registered in the names of the five individuals.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[86]</b> In our view, as the order had the effect of depriving the five individuals of their property in contravention of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NLC_1965_56;340.;;">s 340</LINK>, and as the other provisions of the NLC (in particular those on forfeiture or reversal of land) do not apply in this case, and as this was not an order made in a land acquisition proceeding, that revocation order was clearly contrary to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;13.;;">art 13 cl(1) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[87]</b> On the basis of the above analysis, we allowed the appeal and set aside the orders of the High Court appealed against.</p>
  </JUDGMENT>
