    <p>This was an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal declaring <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66 of the Syariah Criminal (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 1992</LINK> ('<LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK>') to be invalid as being unconstitutional due to inconsistency with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution ('FC')</LINK>. The Court of Appeal allowed the respondents' application following their appeal to the court after their initial judicial review application in the High Court was dismissed. In this appeal, counsel for the 1st to 5th appellants pointed out that when such validity or constitutionality of the law was challenged, namely that the State Legislature had no power to enact the law, the specific procedure as laid down in cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the FC</LINK> must be complied with. Accordingly, the fundamental question was could the validity or constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> be challenged in the High Court by way of a collateral attack in a judicial review proceeding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appeal):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The respondents' argument, that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> passed by the State Legislature must comply with the provisions on fundamental liberties in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the FC</LINK>, for all intent and purposes, was a direct challenge to the validity or constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> passed by the State Legislature of Negeri Sembilan. Therefore, such a challenge must be in accordance with the specific procedure as specified in cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the FC</LINK>. In this instance, since the respondents failed to follow the specific procedure, the judges of the Court of Appeal as well as the High Court were in grave error in entertaining the respondents' application to question the validity or constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> by way of judicial review, as the courts below were not seized with the jurisdiction to do so. It was trite that any proceeding heard without jurisdiction or power to do so was null and void <i>ab initio</i>. In the circumstances, the judgments of the Court of Appeal as well as the High Court were set aside and the judicial review action by the respondents was declared incompetent by reason of substantive procedural non-compliance with cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the FC</LINK>.

    <p>
      <b>Introduction</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> This is an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal declaring <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66 of the Syariah Criminal (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 1992</LINK> to be invalid as being unconstitutional due to inconsistency with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The 1st appellant is the State Government of Negeri Sembilan. The 2nd appellant is the Islamic Affairs Department of Negeri Sembilan, which is a department of the 1st appellant responsible for Islamic affairs within the State of Negeri Sembilan. The 3rd appellant is the Director of the 2nd appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> The 4th appellant is the Chief Religious Enforcement Officer of Negeri Sembilan, who is appointed pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_2003_010;79.;;">s 79 of the Administration of the Religion of Islam (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 2003</LINK>. Amongst his duties is the carrying out of investigations under any written law in Negeri Sembilan prescribing offences against the precepts of the religion of Islam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The 5th appellant is the Chief Syarie Prosecutor of Negeri Sembilan who is appointed pursuant to <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_2003_010;78.;;">s 78(1) of the Administration of the Religion of Islam (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 2003</LINK>. The 5th appellant has the power exercisable at his discretion to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence before a Syariah Court in Negeri Sembilan.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> The 6th appellant is a body established under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_2003_010;4.;;">s 4 of the Administration of the Religion of Islam (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 2003</LINK> to aid and advise the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan in matters relating to the religion of Islam.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The three respondents are bridal make-up artists professing the religion of Islam. They are men suffering from a medical condition called Gender Identity Disorder (GID). Due to their condition, the respondents have been expressing themselves as women and showing mannerisms of the feminine gender such as wearing women's clothes and make-up.
</p>
    <p>
      <b>Background Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> On 4 November 2011, the respondents were granted leave to file an application for judicial review by the Seremban High Court under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (RHC 1980)</LINK>. The reliefs sought by the respondents are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> On 11 October 2012, the respondents' application for judicial review was dismissed by the High Court. Aggrieved, the respondents filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> On 7 November 2014, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and amongst others declared that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> was unconstitutional as being inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The 1st to the 5th appellants then filed an application for leave to appeal to the Federal Court. At the same time, the 6th appellant, together with Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan, Majlis Agama Islam dan Adat Melayu Perak, Majlis Agama Islam Negeri Pulau Pinang, Majlis Agama Islam Negeri Johor, applied for leave to intervene.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> The applications to intervene by the proposed interveners were heard together with the application for leave to appeal by the 1st to the 5th appellants. On 27 January 2015, the Federal Court granted the 1st to the 5th appellants leave to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal. At the same time the Federal Court allowed only the Majilis Agama Islam Negeri Sembilan to intervene as a party in the substantive appeal. The Majilis Agama Islam Negeri Sembilan now appears herein as the 6th appellant and the Federal Court also extended an invitation to the other proposed interveners (whose applications to intervene were dismissed) to appear as <i>amicus curiae</i> to assist the court on legal and/or constitutional issues at the hearing of the appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Question Of Law</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> The principal question of law posed by the appellants in this appeal is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">Section 66</LINK> provides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> As stated earlier, the Court of Appeal was of the view that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is invalid and unconstitutional. Firstly, it offends the fundamental liberties as enshrined in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. Secondly, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> has the effect of restricting the freedom of speech and expression under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(1)(a)</LINK> when under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">art 10(2)</LINK> only Parliament has the power to enact such law and the State Legislature has no power to enact the same. Additionally, it was held that the restriction to freedom of expression imposed by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is unreasonable which renders it unconstitutional. The relevant judgment of the Court of Appeal speaking through Mohd Hishamuddin Yunus JCA is reproduced below:</p>

      <b>Preliminary Issue</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> It was submitted by learned counsel for the 1st to the 5th appellants that the net effect of the findings of the Court of Appeal is that the Negeri Sembilan State Legislature has no power to enact <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK>. It was pointed out that when such validity or constitutionality of the law is challenged on that ground, namely that the State Legislature has no power to enact the law, the specific procedure as laid down in cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> must be complied with.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> Clauses (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> provide:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> It was pointed out by learned counsel that cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> were extensively deliberated upon by the Federal Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1976_1_410;"><i>Ah Thian v. Government Of Malaysia</i> [1976] 1 MLRA 410</LINK>; [1976] 2 MLJ 112 where Suffian LP held as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Learned counsel also referred to the case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1987_1_242;"><i>Abdul Karim Abdul Ghani v. The Legislative Assembly Of The State Of Sabah</i> [1987] 1 MLRA 242</LINK>; [1988] 1 MLJ 171; [1988] 1 CLJ 1 where Hashim Yeop Sani SCJ explained the underlying purposes of cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Learned counsel for the 6th appellant fully adopted the submission on the issues raised above. He further pointed out that the declaration sought by the respondents that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is void for being inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK> should have been rejected by the High Court on the ground that the High Court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter. According to him, the respondents should have filed an application for leave to a judge of the Federal Court pursuant to cl (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4</LINK> of the Federal Constitution and thereafter, if leave is granted, the respondents may then proceed to file the case as an original action for those declarations before the Federal Court, and not by way of judicial review before the High Court, as was done in this case.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> In response, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the respondents were not questioning the legislative power of the State Legislature and therefore their application does not fall strictly within cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. For that reason the respondents did not have to follow the procedure as specified in cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. Further and in the alternative, it was submitted that the respondents' application by way of judicial review has not in any way prejudiced the appellants. Thus, he urged this court to hear the case on its merit.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> With respect, we are unable to agree with the learned counsel for the respondents. The issue here is not whether the appellants are in any way being prejudiced by the mode of action undertaken by the respondents. This case raises a larger issue. It is about the jurisdiction of the courts. The fundamental question is could the validity or constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> be challenged in the High Court by way of a collateral attack in a judicial review proceeding?</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> The Federal Court in the recent decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2014_4_205;"><i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors</i> [2014] 4 MLRA 205</LINK>; [2014] 4 MLJ 765; [2014] 6 CLJ 541, had held that the validity or constitutionality of the laws could not be questioned by way of collateral attack in a judicial review proceeding. In that case, the applicant filed an application for judicial review under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;53.;;">O 53 r 3(1) of the RHC 1980</LINK>, challenging the decision of the Minister which imposed the condition that the applicant was prohibited from using the word "Allah" in Herald - The Catholic Weekly. In the judicial review application before the High Court, the applicant challenged the validity or constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;9.;;">s 9 of the relevant State Enactment</LINK> which made it an offence for a person who is not a Muslim to use the word "Allah" except by way of quotation or reference. The High Court held that</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> The decision of the High Court was set aside by the Court of Appeal. In the applicant's application to obtain leave to appeal to the Federal Court, Arifin Zakaria CJ delivering the majority judgment held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> In answering the question Arifin Zakaria CJ held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> It was on the above premise that the Federal Court, by a majority, following the earlier cases of <i>Ah Thian v. Government Of Malaysia (supra)</i> and <i>Abdul Karim Abdul Ghani v. The Legislative Assembly Of The State Of Sabah (supra)</i>, ruled that the validity or constitutionality of the laws could not be questioned by way of collateral attack in a judicial review proceeding before the High Court. Such challenge could only be made by way of the specific procedure as provided for in cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> Similarly, in the present case, the application for judicial review filed by the respondents was <i>inter alia</i> to seek a declaration that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> is null and void for being inconsistent with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. We are of the view that the application for the declarations sought by the respondents before the High Court by way of judicial review was in fact, a challenge to the legislative powers of the State Legislature of Negeri Sembilan. What the respondents attempted to do was to limit the legislative powers of the State Legislature, by saying that despite the powers to legislate on matters on Islamic law having been given to the State Legislature by <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;74.;;">art 74 of the Federal Constitution</LINK> read with <LINK HREF="LegislationMainDisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;;">List II in the Ninth Schedule to the Federal Constitution</LINK>, that Legislation must still comply with the provisions on fundamental liberties in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>. The application for the declarations sought by the respondents should have been dismissed by the High Court on the ground that the High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> Thus, we are not persuaded by the submissions of learned counsel for the respondents that the respondents are not questioning the legislative powers of the State Legislature. The respondents' argument, that the Legislation on Islamic law passed by the State Legislature must comply with the provisions on fundamental liberties in <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;5.;;">arts 5(1)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;8.;;">8(1), (2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;9.;;">9(2)</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;10.;;">10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution</LINK>, is an argument that directly questions the legislative powers of the State Legislature. For all intent and purposes, it was a direct challenge to the validity or constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> passed by the State Legislature of Negeri Sembilan. As stated earlier, such a challenge must be in accordance with the specific procedure as specified in cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> We are of the view that since the respondents had failed to follow the specific procedure as laid down in cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>, the learned judges of the Court of Appeal as well as the High Court were in grave error in entertaining the respondents' application to question the validity or constitutionality of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_NSEM_1992_004;66.;;">s 66</LINK> by way of judicial review. The courts below were not seized with the jurisdiction to do so. It is trite that any proceeding heard without jurisdiction or power to do so is null and void <i>ab initio</i>. (See <i>Ah Thian v. Government of Malaysia (supra)</i>, <i>Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop Of Kuala Lumpur v. Menteri Dalam Negeri &amp; Ors (supra)</i> and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In the circumstances, for the reasons stated above, we allow the appeal solely on the preliminary issue raised by the appellants. We hereby set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal as well as the High Court and declare that the judicial review action by the respondents is incompetent by reason of substantive procedural non-compliance with cls (3) and (4) of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1957_000;4.;;">art 4 of the Federal Constitution</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> As the appellants are not asking for costs, we made no order as to costs.</p>
