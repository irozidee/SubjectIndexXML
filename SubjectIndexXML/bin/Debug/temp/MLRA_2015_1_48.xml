    <p>The two appeals before the court stemmed from the respondent's claim against the appellants in the High Court. The respondent claimed that the appellants were liable for a personal loan of USD250,000 granted by him to the appellants. The loan was allegedly granted to finance a company of which the appellants were directors. The respondent claimed that he banked the loan sum into the company's account at the appellants' request, and in return, the appellants agreed to procure 250,000 Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares ('RCP shares') in the company for the respondent. The agreement for the shares was made under a subscription agreement (the 'subscription agreement') signed between the respondent and the company. However, it transpired that the shares were not issued to the respondent resulting in the respondent's claim against the appellants and the company in the High Court. The appellants contended that there was no valid cause of action against them as the subscription agreement was strictly between the respondent and the company, and as such they made an application under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A of the Rules of Court 2012 ('O 14A')</LINK> to summarily dismiss the respondent's claim. The High Court dismissed the appellants' <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application and allowed the respondent's claim after a full trial. Hence, the two appeals before the court. The appeal in W-02(IM)(NCVC)-1105-05- 2013 ('Appeal 1105') was the appellants' appeal against the dismissal of their <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application whilst the appeal in W-02(NCVC)(W)-1553-07-2013 ('Appeal 1553') was the appellants' appeal against the High Court's decision allowing the respondent's claim.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, dismissing Appeal 1105 and allowing Appeal 1553:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> The present case was not an appropriate case for disposal by way of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> in the light of the conflicting allegations of facts contained in the affidavits of both parties. The facts in issue were interwoven with the legal issues raised and as such the learned judge was correct in dismissing the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application and in ordering the matter to proceed to trial. (paras 25-26)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> The respondent gave an assurance to the appellants that he did not require any personal guarantee from them as he agreed to help the 1st appellant who was like a brother to him. That explained why the respondent made no mention of the personal loan in the subscription agreement that he drafted. If meant to be a loan, it would have been reduced in writing with terms of repayment specifically spelt out given that the amount involved was fairly substantial. A "repayment term" was an essential element necessary to constitute a loan contract as a cause of action to recover such loan could only arise upon the failure or refusal to pay on the due date or agreed date. There was no such terms pleaded by the respondent and the only averment in relation to the personal loan was in para 6 of the respondent's amended statement of claim. In the absence of any contemporaneous documentary evidence evincing such a personal loan, the learned judge's finding that such a loan existed was clearly unsustainable. Further, it was not legally tenable for the respondent to plead the personal loan sum when the same sum was pleaded as consideration for the subscription of the RCP shares. It was not possible for both contractual relationships to exist when there was only one payment of USD250,000 made by the respondent. The learned judge was misconceived when she held there were two separate contractual relationships when the evidence and pleadings did not support the same. (paras 29-40)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> A contract came into existence at the time it was made, which, as pleaded by the respondent, would be before the subscription agreement was signed. Once the agreement was signed such a contract must be substituted or replaced by the agreement. As the respondent, by his own admission, paid the USD250,000 into the company's bank account, instructed the draft of the agreement and signed the same, the respondent was bound by it and all the terms contained therein by virtue of the entire agreement clause in the agreement. The respondent's evidence that the USD250,000 was a personal loan to the appellants was clearly parol evidence as it contradicted the clear terms of the agreement and therefore inadmissible. It followed that the learned judge erred in holding that <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;91.;;">ss 91</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;92.;;">92 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> were not applicable. (paras 41-44)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(4)</b> The company upon its incorporation acquired a separate legal personality altogether from its members. While it has been accepted by high authority that the veil of incorporation could be lifted in equity in the interest of justice, such instances were "special circumstances" and were by way of exception, which required the particulars of such instances to be clearly pleaded. The respondent herein pleaded that the appellants as directors/agents procured or caused the breach in the terms of the subscription agreement and/or failed to remedy them. That was insufficient to justify the lifting of the corporate veil. If a plaintiff sought to rely on any allegations that required the lifting of the corporate veil, such allegations must be specifically pleaded. It was clear from the respondent's pleadings that the said issue was not specifically pleaded. (paras 45-47)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(5)</b> The learned judge erred in accepting the respondent's evidence that the offer of USD375,000 by the appellants was a proposal by them to settle the personal loan and the company's obligations under the subscription agreement. Such payment was more than what the respondent was entitled to under the agreement. Secondly, such an acceptance by the respondent was not specifically pleaded as it ought to show that there was a concluded and enforceable agreement with regards to the alleged offer to settle. (para 48)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(6)</b> On whether the appellants were jointly and severally liable to the respondent, the learned judge failed to appreciate that there was no agreement by them to be jointly and severally liable for the company's breach of the subscription agreement. Therefore, there was no basis in fact and in law for the learned judge to hold the appellants jointly and severally liable for the company's breach. In the circumstances, there was insufficient judicial appreciation by the learned judge in allowing the respondent's claim. (paras 49-51)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alizatul Khair Osman Khairuddin JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> These two appeals were heard together:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> Appeal 1105 was the 1st and 2nd appellants' (the 1st and 2nd defendants in the court below) appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who had dismissed their application to have the case disposed of by way of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A;SN1.;;">O 14A r 1</LINK> (encl 33). Appeal 1553 was the 1st and 2nd appellant's appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge who had allowed the respondent's claim with costs after a full trial.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> In this judgment the parties will be referred to as they were referred to in the High Court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Material Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The undisputed material facts were as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On 29 Sepetember 2005 the plaintiff entered into a subscription agreement with Aeronimbus Holdings Ltd (the 3rd defendant in the court below) (the said agreement). Under the said agreement the plaintiff agreed to subscribe for 250,000 Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS) in the 3rd defendant. The RCPS shares were priced at USD1.00 per share. The said agreement contained the following salient terms:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The said agreement was drafted, prepared and faired by the plaintiff's solicitor at the material time, one, John Tong of Messrs Shui-Tai (the plaintiff's present solicitors) and not by the defendants or their solicitors.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The said agreement was signed by the plaintiff on the one hand and the 2nd defendant (as director of the 3rd defendant) on the other.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> By letter dated 23 Sepetember 2005, the plaintiff instructed his bank (Citibank Singapore Ltd) to remit the sum of USD250,000.00 into the 3rd defendant's bank account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> However the 3rd defendant did not issue the RCPS shares to the plaintiff within seven days from the date of the said agreement, (ie 29 Sepetember 2005) as provided therein or even thereafter. Some few years after the said agreement, the said John Tong was instructed by the plaintiff to issue and according to him did so issue a demand to the 3rd defendant for the RCPS shares. Subsequently, almost six years later, the plaintiff's present solicitors issued a letter of demand dated 20 Sepetember 2011 to the 1st and 2nd defendants alleging that the payment of USD250,000.00 was a personal loan and that the latter (1st and 2nd defendants) had allegedly offered to pay (to the plaintiff) in March 2006 a sum of USD375,000.00.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> By letter dated 22 Sepetember 2011 from their solicitors, the 1st and 2nd defendant denied the allegations and asserted that the said agreement was strictly between the 3rd defendant and the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> On 29 Sepetember 2011, exactly six years after the said agreement was entered into the writ and statement of claim was filed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> On 12 January 2012, judgment in default of appearance was entered into against the 3rd defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Plaintiff's Pleaded Case</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> To appreciate the issue confronting the court in dealing with these two appeals it is perhaps necessary to set out the plaintiff's pleaded case against the defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> Based on the plaintiff's amended statement of claim the plaintiff's claim against the 1st and 2nd defendants were as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b> As against the 3rd defendant the plaintiffs pleaded case was that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(The "aforesaid breaches" mentioned in paras 14(c) and (d) above refer to the alleged breaches by the 3rd defendant as set out in paras 15(aa)-(dd) above.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The plaintiff alleged that the defendants have until todate failed to pay to the plaintiff the said sum of USD375,000.00 and/or any part of it.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> Thus the plaintiff "now demands from the defendants, jointly and severally for the amount of:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>
        <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> Application (Appeal 1105)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> Based on the plaintiff's pleaded case and the material undisputed facts set out above, the 1st and 2nd defendants contended that on the face of the pleadings there was no valid cause of action recognised in law against the 1st and 2nd defendants. They accordingly filed an <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application for the court to determine the following questions of law:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> Upon the determination of the aforesaid questions of law, the 1st and 2nd defendants prayed that the plaintiff's claim against them as pleaded on the amended statement of claim be dismissed with costs.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> The gist of the 1st and 2nd defendant's submission in support of their application for <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> was briefly as follows.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> With regard to Question 1 the 1st and 2nd defendants' contended that the pleadings revealed no cause of action against the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> With regard to Question 2, it was the 1st and 2nd defendants' contention that no material facts have been pleaded to show that the 1st and 2nd defendants were jointly and severally liable with the 3rd defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[23]</b> Learned counsel argued that based on the above grounds it was clear that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action against the 1st and 2nd defendants and submitted that both Questions 1 and 2 ought to be determined in their favour.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The High Court's Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[24]</b> The learned judge on 7 February 2013 dismissed the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application on the basis that "this was not a plain and simple matter that can be determine (sic) without a full trial." In the learned judge's view this case involved material dispute of facts which required both oral and documentary evidence to be adduced. In this regard the learned judge referred to the affidavits filed by both parties which revealed conflicting allegations of facts, in particular, as regards the alleged personal loan of USD250,000.00. To quote the learned judge:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[25]</b> We agreed with the learned judge that this was not an appropriate case for disposal by way of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> in the light of the conflicting allegations of facts contained in the affidavit of both parties. The Court of Appeal in the fairly recent case of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2011_1_389;"><i>Bato Bagi &amp; Ors v. Government Of The State Of Sarawak</i> [2011] 1 MLRA 389</LINK>; [2011] 6 CLJ 387 at p 396 spelt out in clear and distinct terms the scope of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[26]</b> We were of the view that in this case the facts in issue were interwoven with the legal issues raised and as such the learned judge was correct in dismissing the <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_2012_205;Order14A.;;">O 14A</LINK> application and in ordering the matter to proceed to trial. We therefore dismissed the appeal and affirmed the learned judge's decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Full Trial (Appeal 1553)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[27]</b> As stated earlier, the learned judge had, at the conclusion of the trial allowed the plaintiff's claim with costs. In arriving at her decision the learned judge, <i>inter alia</i>, found as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[28]</b> The defendants argued that the learned judge misdirected herself in law in arriving at the above finding due to the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Our Decision</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[29]</b> In respect of this appeal, we agreed with the 1st and 2nd defendants' submission that based on the reasons set out above the learned judge was, with respect, misconceived when she held that there was in existence two separate contractual relationship, one for a personal loan of USD250,000.00 between the plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd defendants and the second the subscription agreement (the said agreement) between the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant when the evidence and pleadings did not support the same. We accordingly allowed the appeal and set aside the learned judge's decision.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[30]</b> By way of elaboration we would state the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[31]</b> The plaintiff had testified that the loan (of USD250,000.00) was given to help the 1st defendant "his dearest friend whom he trusted like a brother." He further testified that the 1st defendant assured him that he would give his money back within six months or a year. He said he did not expect anything in return except for the payment back of the loan sum within six months to one year assured by the 1st defendant. Based on the aforesaid assurance the plaintiff said he did not require any personal guarantee from the 1st and 2nd defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[32]</b> The plaintiff in his oral testimony also explained that although the loan was meant to be a personal loan to the 1st and 2nd defendants, the plaintiff nevertheless agreed to enter into the said agreement with the 3rd defendant due to the 1st defendant's insistence who assured him that the business of the 3rd defendant would become profitable in the short run and the company (the 3rd defendant) was able to deliver the shares and the dividends.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[33]</b> The plaintiff further stated that he did not require any personal liability to be imposed on the 1st and 2nd defendants to repay the loan so long as he received the money back within six months or a year and that was the specific instruction given to PW1 who drafted the said agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[34]</b> PW1 in his evidence confirmed such instruction and testified that the said agreement did not make any reference to the personal liability of the 1st and 2nd defendants because the said agreement was between the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant and the plaintiff did not wish the personal loan to be in writing.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[35]</b> As for PW2's evidence, she merely repeated what the plaintiff had told her, that is, the 3rd defendant was not doing very well and needed funding.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[36]</b> PW2 was also told that the 3rd defendant had cash flow problems and the 1st defendant had asked the plaintiff for a loan of USD250,000.00. As the learned judge herself observed "PW2 was oblivious of the details of the loan of USD250,000.00" except that she knew that it was actually given out either to the 1st or 2nd defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[37]</b> It was clear from the above evidence that what the plaintiff had agreed to do to help "his dearest friend whom he trusted like a brother" (the 1st defendant) was to invest in his company by subscribing for the 250,000 RCPS shares. That explained why the plaintiff specifically instructed PW1 to draft the said agreement in such a manner, that is, without any mention of any personal liability on the part of the 1st and 2nd defendant to repay the so called "personal loan" of USD250,000.00. It was inconceivable, in our view, if there was such a loan that it was not reduced in writing with its terms clearly spelt out, in particular the terms of repayment given that the amount involved was fairly substantial. It was held in <i>Ricardo G Tapel (supra)</i> that a "repayment term" was an essential element necessary to constitute a loan contract as a cause of action to recover such loan could only arise upon the failure or refusal to pay on the due date or agreed date.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[38]</b> No such terms have been pleaded by the plaintiff in their pleadings where the only averment in relation to the alleged personal loan is found in para 6 of the plaintiff's amended statement of claim and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the absence of any contemporaneous documentary evidence evincing such a personal loan the learned judge's finding that there was in existence such a loan was clearly unsustainable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[39]</b> Further it was not legally tenable for the plaintiff to plead the USD250,000.00 as a 'personal loan' to the 1st and 2nd defendants (para 6 of the statement of claim) when the very same sum was pleaded as the consideration for the subscription of the 250,000 RCPS shares under the said agreement with the 3rd defendant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[40]</b> It was not possible for both contractual relationships to exist when there was only one payment of USD250,000.00 made by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[41]</b> As submitted by the 1st and 2nd defendants based on the said pleadings the premise of the plaintiff's case appeared to be as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[42]</b> That being the case, the learned judge misdirected herself when she accepted the plaintiff's evidence that the USD250,000.00 was also a 'personal loan' to the 1st and 2nd defendants when such evidence was clearly parol evidence as they contradicted and was inconsistent with the clear terms of the said agreement, and therefore inadmissible. (See <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;92.;;">s 92 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> and the Federal Court decision of <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2009_2_514;"><i>Chase Perdana Bhd v. Md Afendi Hamdan</i> [2009] 2 MLRA 514</LINK>; [2006] 5 MLJ 798; [2009] 6 CLJ 501 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1979_1_81;"><i>Tindok Besar Estate Sdn Bhd v. Tinjar Co</i> [1979] 1 MLRA 81</LINK>; [1979] 2 MLJ 229.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>[43]</b> It needs to be re-emphasised that the plaintiff's cause of action as pleaded in their amended statement of claim was for breach of the terms of the said agreement, <i>inter alia</i>, due to the failure of the 3rd respondent:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[44]</b> Given the plaintiffs' pleaded cause of action and the clear factors as to why such parol evidence was obviously contradictory and inconsistent with the terms of the said agreement the learned judge was patently wrong in holding that, as the plaintiff had established that there was in existence a contract for a personal loan the plaintiff was therefore not barred from "proving and claiming the personal loan by using extrinsic evidence" and consequently the provisions of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;91.;;">ss 91</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1971_56;92.;;">92 of the Evidence Act 1950</LINK> were not applicable.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[45]</b> We further found the learned judge erred in holding the 1st and 2nd defendants liable for the aforesaid breaches as the learned judge failed to appreciate that the 3rd defendant upon its incorporation acquired a separate legal personality altogether from its members. (see <i>Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1997] AC 22 and <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2012_2_731;"><i>Alcatel-Lucent (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v. Solid Investments Ltd And Another Appeal</i> [2012] 2 MLRA 731</LINK>; [2012] 4 MLJ 72; [2013] 2 CLJ 734).</p>
    <p>
      <b>[46]</b> While it has been accepted by high authority that the veil of incorporation can be lifted in equity in the interest of justice, such instances are "special circumstances" and are by way of exception which require the particulars of such instances to be clearly pleaded. The judgment of His Lordship Gopal Sri Ram JCA (as he then was) in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2005_1_521;"><i>Law Kam Loy &amp; Anor v. Boltex Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors</i> [2005] 1 MLRA 521</LINK>; [2005] 3 CLJ 355; [2005] 4 AMR 525 is instructive:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[47]</b> In the present case all that the plaintiff had pleaded in their amended statement of claim was as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That in our view was insufficient to justify lifting the corporate veil. It is trite law that if the plaintiff were seeking to rely on any allegations that require the corporate veil to be lifted, such allegations must be specifically pleaded. In <i>Alcatel-Lucent (supra)</i>, the Court of Appeal held that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Therefore, the judgment of the learned judge ought to be set aside in this ground alone.</p>
    <p>It was clear from the plaintiff's pleadings that this issue was never specifically pleaded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[48]</b> We also agreed with the 1st and 2nd defendants that as regards the amount of USD375,000.00 allegedly offered by the 1st and 2nd defendants to settle the matter, the learned judge erred in accepting the plaintiff's evidence that "he immediately accepted the offer of USD375,000.00 as the sum was more than the 25% dividend promised by the defendants, and he perceived the offer to be the proposal by them to settle the personal loan and the 3rd defendant's obligations under the subscription agreement" as such payment was more than what the plaintiff was entitled to under the said agreement. Secondly, such 'acceptance' by the plaintiff as found by the learned judge was never specifically pleaded as it ought to have been to show that there was indeed a concluded and enforceable agreement with regards to the alleged offer to settle.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[49]</b> Finally the plaintiff had claimed in their statement of claim that the 1st and 2nd defendants were jointly liable to pay the plaintiff the amount claimed, that is RM1,211,625.00 together with interest and cost.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[50]</b> In allowing the plaintiff's claim above, the learned judge with respect failed to appreciate that there was no agreement by the 1st and 2nd defendants to be held jointly and severally liable for the 3rd defendant's breach of the terms of the said agreement, as admitted by PW1 and PW3 in their evidence at the trial. There was therefore no basis in fact and in law for the court to find the 1st and 2nd defendants jointly and severally liable for the 3rd defendant's breach.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[51]</b> For the above reasons, we would agree with the 1st and 2nd defendants that there was "insufficient judicial appreciation by the learned judge of the pleadings, contemporaneous evidence, and preponderance of logic and probabilities of the case" when she allowed the plaintiff's claim. In this regard we find the observations of the Court of Appeal in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_2013_2_335;"><i>Nortel Networks (Asia) Limited &amp; Ors v. Sapura Holdings Sdn Bhd &amp; Anor</i> [2013] 2 MLRA 335</LINK>; [2012] 6 MLJ 491; [2012] 8 CLJ 296 particularly apposite:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[52]</b> Applying the principle enunciated in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1996_1_260;"><i>China Airlines Ltd v. Maltran Air Corp Sdn Bhd &amp; Another Appeal</i> [1996] 1 MLRA 260</LINK>; [1996] 2 MLJ 517; [1996] 3 CLJ 163; [1996] 1 AMR 2233, we were of the view that this was a fit and proper case for appellate intervention. We therefore allowed the appeal and set aside the learned judge's decision. We awarded costs of RM30,000.00 to the appellant and ordered the deposit to be refunded.</p>
