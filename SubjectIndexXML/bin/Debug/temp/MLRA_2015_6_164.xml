    </CATCHWORDS>
    <p>The respondent/plaintiff had filed the action against the defendants for alleged fraud, breach of fiduciary duties and conversion against the defendants. It was adduced in evidence that the writ was not served on the appellant and the solicitor who had purportedly acted for the appellant was not able to say by affidavit evidence that he had been authorised to act for the appellant. On the date of trial, the learned trial judge entered default judgment against the appellant and proceeded to hear the case and at the end of the trial entered judgment against the other defendants. The appellant/3rd defendant therefore appealed against the decision of the trial judge.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b>, allowing the appellant's appeal:</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> It is well settled that: (i) non service of writ and statement of claim will be in breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1980_050;10.;;">O 10 r 1(1) of RHC 1980</LINK> which was in force at the material time (<i>Muniandy Thamba Kaundan &amp; Anor v. Development &amp; Commercial Bank Berhad &amp; Anor (refd)</i>); (ii) the entry of appearance without service of writ and/or without authorization is invalid and the solicitors who enter appearance without authority may be liable for disciplinary action by Advocates Disciplinary Board as well as be liable for negligence to the plaintiff (<i>Lim Chong Construction Co Sdn Bhd. v. Silam Quarry Sdn Bhd (refd)</i>); (iii) without a retainer by the solicitor from the client, the court will treat the solicitor as having acted without authority (para 6)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> What is important under the procedural law and jurisprudence in relation to writ and service is that it is the duty and obligation of the plaintiff to serve the writ and statement of claim on the defendant and file an affidavit of service stating so. If the writ and statement of claim is found to be not served according to law, the service is a nullity <i>ab initio</i>. The court will be obliged to consider the application to set aside not on the issue of irregularity or merits but determine on the well-established principle of nullity <i>ab initio</i> (<i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd (refd)</i>). The learned Judicial Commissioner had failed to consider the relevant jurisprudence relating to nullity and retainer and the judgment stood as a perverse judgment. (para 8)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> In the instant case, the writ was never served on the appellant. There was also no affidavit of service positively affirming the writ was served. If the originating process was not served and any orders obtained subsequently in the absence of the respondent was null and void and had no effect. Such orders must be set aside <i>ex debito justiciae</i>. The respondent was not able to demonstrate according to law the writ was in actual fact served. There was merit in the complaint advanced by the appellant in the Memorandum of Appeal. (para 10)</p>

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hamid Sultan Abu Backer JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant/3rd defendant appeals against the judgment dated 25 July 2013 of learned Judicial Commissioner, who had refused to set aside the judgment in default, came up for hearing on 7 January 2014 and on the same day we allowed the appeal, and the prayers (a) to (e) except prayer (d) in Notice of Application to set aside the default judgment dated 19 April 2013 found at pp 32 to 34 of the Appeal Record. My learned brother Azahar Mohamed JCA and learned sister Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat JCA have read the draft judgment and approved the same. This is our judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Preliminaries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> In the instant case, the learned counsel for the appellant had filed submission on the law and facts comprising 38 pages. We do not think much judicial time should be spent to craft this judgment when evidence is clear and unrebutted that the writ was never served on the appellant and there is purported admission of the solicitors who had filed the memorandum of appearance on behalf of the appellant, was never directly authorised to file the same and unchallenged evidence of the appellant that he was never served with the writ and/or authorised the said solicitor to act for the appellant. The Memorandum of Appeal is reproduced to appreciate the facts as well as the submission of the appellant in the right perspective and it reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> We note that the Memorandum of Appeal is drafted in the form of submission. This is not permissible under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;18.;;">r 18(1) of the Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994</LINK> which read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The respondent ought to have made an application to strike out the Memorandum of Appeal for breach of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;18.;;">r 18(1)</LINK> for prolixity or seek an order for it to be amended to comply with <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_PUAS_1994_524;18.;;">r 18(1)</LINK>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Brief Facts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> The respondent/plaintiff had filed the action against the defendants for alleged fraud, breach of fiduciary duties and conversion against the defendants. It is not in dispute as per the evidence, the writ was never served on the appellant and also the solicitor who had purportedly acted for the appellant was never able to say by affidavit evidence or otherwise that he had been authorised to act for the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> On the date of trial, the learned trial judge entered default judgment against the appellant and proceeded to hear the case and at the end of the trial entered judgment against the other defendants.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> It is well settled that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> We must say the learned Judicial Commissioner has set out the facts and law and we accept it is as a speaking judgment. The conclusion reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> What is important under the procedural law and jurisprudence in relation to writ and service is that it is the duty and obligation of the plaintiff to serve the writ and statement of claim on the defendant and file an affidavit of service stating so. If the writ and statement of claim is found to be not served according to law, the service is a nullity <i>ab initio</i>. The court will be obliged to consider the application to set aside not on the issue of irregularity or merits but determine on the well established principle of nullity <i>ab initio</i> as propounded by the Federal Court in the case of <i>Badiaddin</i>. [See <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRA_1998_1_183;"><i>Badiaddin Mohd Mahidin &amp; Anor v. Arab Malaysian Finance Bhd</i> [1998] 1 MLRA 183</LINK>; [1998] 1 MLJ 393; [1998] 2 CLJ 75; [1998] 1 AMR 909]. The learned Judicial Commissioner had failed to consider the relevant jurisprudence relating to nullity and retainer and in our considered view, the judgment stands as a perverse judgment.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> In abundance of caution, we must say if the plaintiff has served the writ, but if the defendant disputes the service, the conduct of the defendant can be taken to allow or dismiss the application. However, if the plaintiff is not able to establish that he has served the writ and statement of claim, the whole proceeding against the defendant is a nullity <i>ab initio</i>. The distinction is like apple and orange, and needs no elaboration. The court is obliged to set aside the judgment in default.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> We have read the Appeal Records and the able submissions of the parties. After much consideration to the submissions of the learned counsel for the respondent, we take the view that the appeal must be allowed. Our reasons <i>inter alia</i> are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[11</b> This is a fit and proper case for appeal to be allowed. In consequence, the appeal was allowed as stated above and the respondent was ordered to pay costs of RM10,000.00 here and below to the appellant. The deposit was ordered to be refunded.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> We hereby ordered so.</p>
