    <p>The appellant was the registered proprietor of a property in Taman Sri Muda, Shah Alam, Selangor ("the said property"), which the respondents intended to buy. Following that, the respondents occupied the said property and made renovations without the appellant's consent. Nevertheless, in complying with the respondents' wishes to buy the said property, the appellant and respondents entered into a sale and purchase agreement ("the agreement"). Accordingly, the respondents paid a deposit representing 48% of the purchase price to the appellant. At that material time, the said property was still under the appellant's late mother's name. Thus, by virtue of cl 9 of the agreement, the parties agreed that the balance of the purchase price was to be paid by the respondents to the appellant within four months from the date that the appellant obtained the letters of administration. The respondents, however, failed to do so. Hence, the appellant filed a suit against the respondents in the High Court, claiming vacant possession of the said property and a declaration that the agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondents was null and void. Additionally, the appellant prayed for a declaration that the respondents were staying in the said property in the capacity as tenants and, thus, a certain sum needed to be refunded by the appellant to the respondents for the period the said property was occupied. The respondents contested the appellant's claim by filing a counterclaim against the appellant for, <i>inter alia</i>, specific performance of the agreement; renovation costs incurred by the respondents; and damages. The Judicial Commissioner ("JC") dismissed the appellant's claim, but allowed the respondents' counterclaim. In this appeal, the appellant argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that the JC had misdirected himself in allowing the respondents' counterclaim on the issues of limitation, specific performance and consent by the appellant to the carrying out of the renovation works on the said property and the non-payment of rental.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Held</b> (allowing the appellant's claim):</p>
    <p>
      <b>(1)</b> In exercising the court's discretion to order specific performance of a contract for the sale and purchase of land, it was incumbent on it to be satisfied whether the party in whose favour specific performance was to be ordered was able and willing to settle the payment of the purchase price. In this instance, based on the evidence adduced, the respondents could not satisfy this requirement, and therefore the High Court had erred in ordering specific performance. (<i>Wong Kup Sing v. Jeram Rubber Estates Ltd (refd)</i>). (para 19)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(2)</b> In the instant case, the High Court had fundamentally erred in failing to appreciate that the counterclaim was essentially based on a claim for breach of contract for which the limitation period was six years calculated from the date of accrual of the cause of action. The respondents were already in occupation and the appellant had sued to obtain vacant possession; therefore, the counterclaim was time-barred. Furthermore, even if the calculation took into account cl 9 of the agreement, the respondents' counterclaim would be time-barred. (para 20)</p>
    <p>
      <b>(3)</b> On the facts, the High Court erred in concluding that the appellant had consented to the renovations and the non-payment of rental. A proper judicial appreciation of the evidence would have indicated the contrary, as the inferences drawn by the JC effectively meant that the respondents would enjoy residing in the said property free-of-charge for a good many years when they were unable to effect payment of the balance purchase price.

      <b>JUDGMENT</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof JCA:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>[1]</b> The appellant is the registered proprietor of a property known as HS(D) 37865, PT No 5377, Daerah Klang, Negeri Selangor bearing postal address No 24, Jalan 25/54, Taman Sri Muda, 40400 Shah Alam, Selangor (hereinafter referred to as "the said property").</p>
    <p>
      <b>[2]</b> The appellant contended that in September 2000, she had rented the said property to the 1st and 2nd respondents, who are spouses, for a rental sum of RM500.00 per month. Nevertheless, before the first month of rental could be collected, the respondents through one Mr Siva, a property agent, had asked the appellant to sell the said property to them which the appellant later agreed. However, it was alleged that sometime in September 2000, the respondents had occupied the said property and made renovations without the appellant's knowledge and consent.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[3]</b> Nevertheless, in complying with the respondents' wishes to buy the said property, the appellant and respondents entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 13 March 2001 (hereinafter referred to as "the said agreement"), prepared by Messrs Hassan Kuldeep &amp; Co in which the respondents agreed to purchase the said property at the price of RM125,000.00. The respondents paid on 15 November 2000 a deposit representing 48% of the purchase price, ie RM60,000.00, to the appellant. However, the respondents failed to pay the balance of purchase price of RM65,000.00 despite many attempts to claim the same being made by the appellant.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[4]</b> At that material time, the said property was still under the appellant's late mother's name and the appellant was not yet appointed as an administratrix to the said property. This fact was in the knowledge of the respondents. According to the respondents, by virtue of cl 9 of the said agreement that was kept in their possession, the parties agreed that the balance purchase price of RM65,000.00 was to be paid by the respondents to the appellant within three months (with an extension of one month) from the date the appellant obtained the Letters of Administration from the High Court. There was an undertaking made by the appellant that in the event that the transfer of the said property could not take place, the deposit of RM60,000.00 would be refunded to the respondents. It is this fact that becomes the major issue in this appeal.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[5]</b> It was alleged by the appellant that the phrase "... or the sealed copy of the Probate from the High Court ..." that was clearly stated in cl 9 of the said agreement in the respondents' possession was omitted from cl 9 of the said agreement that was kept in the appellant's possession, thus creating a significant difference between these two clauses although it was supposed to be the same. An allegation of fraud was raised by the respondents against the appellant. Since the maker of the said agreement, ie Mr Kuldeep from Messrs Hassan Kuldeep &amp; Co was not called to give evidence in court as he could not be located, the same was only marked as ID by the trial court.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[6]</b> The letters of administration which specifies the appellant as the administratrix for her late mother's estate was granted on 22 November 2005. A copy of the same was served to the respondents' solicitors on 24 February 2006. The appellant attempted to argue at trial that as at the time when she entered into the said agreement on 13 March 2001, she was yet to be appointed as the administratrix of her late mother's estate, the said agreement should be declared as null and void <i>ab initio</i> on 15 November 2000.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[7]</b> The appellant then filed a suit against the respondents on 17 March 2011, claiming vacant possession of the said property and a declaration that the said agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondents was null and void. Additionally, the appellant prayed for a declaration that the respondents were staying in the said property in the capacity as tenants from the month of September 2000 to March 2011 on a rental payment of RM400.00 per month. Accordingly, a sum of RM9,600.00 needed to be refunded by the appellant to the respondents as the balance by deducting from part of the purchase price of the said property of RM60,000.00 received by the appellant earlier against the rentals for that duration. The appellant also prayed that in the event that there was a private caveat entered by the respondents on the said property, the same was to be removed.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[8]</b> The respondents' defence was that the said agreement was entered into by the appellant in her capacity as a representative of the vendor and with the undertaking that she would obtain the Letters of Administration for her late mother's estate and/or order for sale of the said property and not as the administratrix as of yet. It was upon this representation by the appellant that the respondents were convinced to enter into the sale and purchase of property transaction.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[9]</b> The respondents thus defended the appellant's claim by filing a counterclaim against the appellant on 18 October 2012, claiming <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[10]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner dismissed the appellant's claim against the respondents on 17 December 2013, but allowed the respondents' counterclaim with costs for the sum of RM20,000.00 to be paid by the appellant. Specific performance on the said agreement dated 13 March 2001 was allowed and the sale and purchase transaction of the said property with the balance purchase price of RM65,000.00 was ordered to be completed within four months from the date of the court's order.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[11]</b> Four principal issues were identified by the learned Judicial Commissioner: (a) validity of the sale and purchase agreement (b) limitation, (c) rental payable in the interval period, (d) whether specific performance could be ordered in the circumstances. In respect of (a), the Judicial Commissioner came to a finding that the sale and purchase agreement in the possession of the defendant was the valid document, and contained the correct cl 9 as agreed between the parties on the date for payment of the balance purchase price:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[12]</b> As regards issue (b), the learned Judicial Commissioner found the counterclaim was filed within time, since the claim involved a "recovery of land" which is covered under <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;9.;;">s 9(1) of the Limitation Act 1953</LINK> (12 years), not <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6</LINK> covering "actions founded on a contract" (6 years). The copy of the sealed letters of administration being served on the respondents' solicitors on 24 February 2006, and the counterclaim being filed on 18 October 2012, it was well within the 12 years from the date of accrual of the cause of action. Had <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1981_254;6.;;">s 6</LINK> applied, the converse would be true.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[13]</b> On issue (c), the learned Judicial Commissioner held:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The inference from the above statements is that the appellant allowed the renovations and acquiesced in the non-payment of the monthly rentals pending fulfilment of payment of the balance purchase price as stipulated under the said agreement.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[14]</b> In relation to whether the necessary conditions for an order for specific performance to be made (issue (d)), the High Court agreed with the respondents' contentions on the applicability of <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;11.;;">ss 11(2)</LINK>, <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;19.;;">19</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;20.;;">20(1)(a) of the Specific Relief Act 1950</LINK>, particularly <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;11.;;">s 11(2)</LINK>. <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;11.;;">Section 11(2)</LINK> specifies:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[15]</b>
      <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;19.;;">Sections 19</LINK> and <LINK HREF="legislationSectiondisplayed.aspx?MY_ACTS_1974_137;20.;;">20(1)(a)</LINK> supplement this general provision by providing:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[16]</b> The learned Judicial Commissioner agreed with the respondents on issue (d) on account of their expenditure of RM45,000.00 on the renovations, the application for a loan from The Bank of Nova Scotia to settle the balance purchase price and the payment of the 48% purchase price. See the following passage in the judgment of the learned Judicial Commissioner:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[17]</b> In the grounds of appeal as disclosed in the memorandum of appeal, the appellant argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that the learned Judicial Commissioner had misdirected himself on the issues of limitation, specific performance and consent by the appellant to the carrying out of the renovation works on the said property and the non-payment of rental. These grounds are reproduced below:</p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[18]</b> On p 454, Rekod Rayuan, Bahagian B Jilid 2(2), the 1st respondent when responding to counsel's question in cross-examination said: </p>
    <blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>[19]</b> In exercising the court's discretion to order specific performance of a contract for the sale and purchase of land, it is incumbent on it to be satisfied whether the party in whose favour specific performance is to be ordered was able and willing to settle the payment of the purchase price. The High Court in <LINK HREF="case_notes/showcase.aspx?pageid=MLRH_1969_1_297;"><i>Wong Kup Sing v. Jeram Rubber Estates Ltd</i> [1969] 1 MLRH 297</LINK>; [1969] 1 MLJ 245, spoke of "a continuous readiness and willingness to perform the contract from the date of the contract to the date of hearing". It was clear on the evidence the respondents here could not satisfy this requirement, and therefore the High Court had erred in ordering specific performance.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[20]</b> Nevertheless, more importantly, the High Court had fundamentally erred in failing to appreciate that the counterclaim was essentially based on a claim for breach of contract for which the limitation period is six years calculated from the date of accrual of cause of action. There was no "recovery of land" issue. The respondents were already in occupation and the appellant had sued to obtain vacant possession. On the facts, the respondents' counterclaim was clearly time-barred, even if the calculation took into account the terms of cl 9 of the agreement which was quoted earlier. The copy of the sealed letter of administration was served on the respondents' solicitors on 24 February 2006. Add another four months for payment, the last date for the appellant to deliver would be 24 June 2006, assuming the respondents were willing and able to settle the balance purchase price on the last day under cl 9. As indicated earlier, the counterclaim was filed on 18 October 2012. On either view, the counterclaim would be statute-barred.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[21]</b> On the facts of this appeal, we also could not agree with the High Court's conclusions that the appellant had consented to the renovations and the non-payment of rental. A proper judicial appreciation of the evidence would have indicated the contrary. The inferences drawn by the judicial commissioner would effectively mean the respondents would enjoy residing in the said property free-of-charge for a good many years when they were unable to effect payment of the balance purchase price.</p>
    <p>
      <b>[22]</b> For the reasons stated above, we unanimously decided to allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court. We allowed the appellant's claim for vacant possession as prayed in para 18(c) of the statement of claim but such vacant possession to be given within a period of six months from the date of our order, free of rentals. We further ordered that the sum of RM9,600.00 be refunded to the respondents as prayed by the appellant.</p>
    <p>We made no order as to costs. The deposit was ordered refunded to the appellant.</p>
    <p>We felt that the wider justice of the case required that we provided a reasonable interval for the respondents to arrange for their moving out from the said property and secure some alternative accommodation.</p>
